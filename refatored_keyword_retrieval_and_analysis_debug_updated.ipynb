       "'Gastric intestinal metaplasia and atrophic gastritis are a known precancerous condition (PCC) of the stomach, meaning that patients with PCC are at risk for gastric cancer and so, diagnosis and risk categorization for these patients is relevant. The aim of this review is to provide an update regarding the problem, diagnosis, and management of PCCs with an emphasis on the role of appropriate endoscopic detection. Poland syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by unilateral aplasia of the sternoclavicular head of pectoralis major muscle with varying degree of same side upper limb anomalies. A 44-year-old man, with a case of adenocarcinoma of stomach, whose CECT chest revealed complete absence of pectoralis major and minor muscles on the left side, was diagnosed with Poland syndrome without presence of typical ipsilateral limb anomalies. Follow-up PET/CT revealed metabolically active recurrent disease with typical findings of Poland syndrome. It is important to be aware of oncologic association in a patient of Poland syndrome as highlighted in the present case. Several studies have shown that colorectal neoplasms (CRN) including colorectal cancer (CRC) may be prevalent in patients with gastric cancer. However, in most of these studies, colonoscopy to investigate the prevalence of CRN was performed prior to surgery. We aimed to investigate whether CRN was more prevalent in postgastrectomy gastric cancer patients than in healthy individuals.\\nWe reviewed the medical records of those patients within a cohort of gastric cancer patients with gastrectomy who underwent colonoscopy between 2016 and 2017. Controls age- and sex-matched with gastric cancer patients at a 2:1 ratio were identified among those who underwent colonoscopy at a health-promotion center. The frequencies of CRN, advanced CRN (ACRN), and CRC among patients with gastrectomy were compared with those in the control subjects. A total of 744 individuals (gastric cancer, 248; control, 496) were included.\\nThe rates of CRN and ACRN in the gastric cancer group were higher than those in the healthy individuals (CRN, 47.6% vs. 34.7%, P< 0.001; ACRN, 16.9% vs. 10.9%, P= 0.020). The rate of CRC was comparable between the 2 groups (2.0% vs. 0.6%, P= 0.125). Multivariate analysis identified previous gastrectomy for gastric cancer and male sex as significant risk factors for (A)CRN.\\nCRN and ACRN were more prevalent in patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer than in the control group. Regular surveillance colonoscopy at appropriate intervals is indicated after gastrectomy. Colonic interposition is rarely used as an oesophageal replacement after resection, as the preferred use of stomach involves less anastomoses and lower risks of major complications. The functional outcome from the colonic conduit is also unpredictable. This report documents the spectrum of experience of a high-volume oesophageal centre, highlighting indications, techniques and functional outcomes. A retrospective review was undertaken of a prospective database from 2012 to 2016. Four of 252 (1.5%) cases in this time period utilised colon interposition. Two cases were for gastric conduit necrosis following oesophageal cancer resections, one for caustic ingestion with both an oesophago-bronchial fistula and gastric injury, and one for a primary oesophageal malignancy in a patient whom previously had a total gastrectomy. All patients had either a retrosternal or posterior mediastinal isoperistaltic right colon conduit placed. Two of three cancer patients are alive and disease free at 3 and 5\\xa0years, respectively. Surviving patients are weight stable and tolerating a normal diet. Both report excellent quality of life using validated assessment tools. Colonic interposition is rarely required in modern oesophageal practice, but with this technique good long-term nutritional and functional outcomes can be obtained. It is required in the armamentarium of a specialist centre, and training given its rarity may require novel approaches such as simulation and cadaveric-based training. Gastric cancer accounts for about 6% of cancers worldwide, being the fifth most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer related death. Gastric carcinogenesis is a multistep and multifactorial process and is the result of the complex interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. The identification of predisposing conditions and of precancerous lesions is the basis for screening programs and early stage treatment. Furthermore, although most gastric cancers are sporadic, familial clustering is observed in up to 10% of patients. Among them, hereditary cases, related to known cancer susceptibility syndromes and/or genetic causes are thought to account for 1-3% of all gastric cancers. The pathology report of gastric resections specimens therefore requires a standardized approach as well as in depth knowledge of prognostic and treatment associated factors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, which cover about 1-2% of gastrointestinal neoplasms with an unadjusted incidence of around 1/100,000/year. They are also the most common non-epithelial neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract and they are associated with a high rate of malignant transformation. They are more common in the stomach (40-60%) while a minor part repeatedly involves jejunum/ileus (25-30%), duodenum (5%), colorectal (5-15%) and esophagus (<1%). There are also much rarer extragastrointestinal stromal tumor (EGIST): these tumors have immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics similar to GISTs and for this reason, they are called this way, EGIST can involve retroperitoneum, mesentery, and omentum, without affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical presentation depends on the primary localization of the neoplasm, however in 18% it is asymptomatic, and it is accidentally discovered during endoscopies, radiological examinations or surgical operations performed for other reasons, especially if it is small in size. More often, they are associated with non-specific symptoms such as early satiety, nausea or vomiting. Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most dangerous complication, often necessitating emergency surgery. The purpose of this case report is to describe our experience in the management of a young patient with gastrointestinal bleeding caused by an unknown voluminous retroperitoneal GIST with metastatic progression using a combined endovascular embolization and debulking-surgery approach for emergency and imatinib therapy combined with radiofrequency for the oncological approach. GIST requires multidisciplinary management, which improves both prognosis and quality of life. Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause among all cancer deaths globally. Although the treatment outcome of GC has improved, the survival of patients with GC at stages III and IV remains unsatisfactory. Among several types of GC, scirrhous type GC (SGC) shows highly aggressive growth and invasive activity, leading to frequent peritoneal metastasis. SGC is well known to accompany abundant stromal cells that compose the tumor microenvironment (TME) along with the produced extracellular matrix (ECM) and secreted factors. One of the main stromal components is cancer associated fibroblast (CAF). In the SGC microenvironment, CAFs are a source of various secreted factors, including fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which mediate prominent tumor-stimulating activity. In turn, cancer cells also secrete numerous factors, which can activate and educate CAFs. Current findings suggest that cancer cells and stromal cells communicate interactively  The receptor tyrosine kinase mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) is frequently altered in cancers and is a common therapeutic target for cancers with MET variants. However, abnormal MET alterations and their associations with patient outcome across different cancer types have not been studied simultaneously. In this study, we try to fill the vacancy in a comprehensive manner and capture the full MET alteration spectrum.\\nA total of 10,967 tumor samples comprising 32 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were analyzed for MET abnormal expression, mutations, and copy number variants (CNVs).\\nMET abnormal expression, alteration frequency, mutation site distribution, and functional impact varied across different cancer types. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has most targetable mutations located in the juxtamembrane domain, and both high expression and amplification of MET are significantly associated with poor prognosis. Kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) harbored the third highest alteration frequency of MET, which was dominated by mutations. While most mutations were in the Pkinase_Tyr domain, a few were targetable. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) harbors very few alterations, but increased MET expression is associated with poor outcomes. Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) had similar characteristics: a high frequency of MET CNVs but relatively few MET mutations, and high MET expression associated with poor prognosis.\\nThis study provided significant and comprehensive information regarding MET abnormal expression, alterations (mutations and CNVs), and their clinical associations among 32 cancer types and offered insights into the full MET alteration spectrum and its implications for prognosis and treatment. To summarize our experience with tubular gastric elongation surgery for management of insufficient gastric length for high esophageal-gastric anastomosis following esophageal carcinoma resection.\\nFrom September, 2015 to October 2016, 5 patients with esophageal cancer were treated in our department, including two with cervical esophageal cancer and 3 with thoracic esophageal cancer. The patients with cervical esophageal cancer underwent pharyngeal resection, total laryngectomy, esophageal varus extubation and gastric oropharyngeal anastomosis, and the patients with thoracic esophageal cancer underwent esophageal cancer resection with incisions on the left neck, the right chest and the median abdomen. During the surgery, the length of the stomach was found insufficient to allow routine oropharyngeal anastomosis, and tubular gastric elongation was conducted to extend the tubular stomach to enable successful completion of the surgery.\\nAll the patients recovered smoothly after the surgery and were discharged after 2-3 weeks.\\nTubular gastric elongation surgery can be a good choice for high esophageal-gastric anastomosis after resection of esophageal cancer in cases of insufficient tubular stomach length or high tension at the anastomosis. An asymptomatic 76-year-old man presented to our department for the treatment of gastric cancer. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a superficial elevated lesion with an irregular central depression in the lower third of the stomach; this was confirmed to be adenocarcinoma by biopsy, while abdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed no abnormal lesions. Based on the patient\\'s clinical diagnosis of early gastric cancer, we planned laparoscopic gastrectomy with preoperative placement of four endoscopic marking clips equipped with indocyanine green-conjugated resin to determine the resection margin. During surgery, a dedicated laparoscopic system was used to detect indocyanine green fluorescence emitted by the clips and determine their precise position. The clips helped to identify an accurate resection line for the stomach, enabling accurate laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. We successfully demonstrated the usefulness of clips with fluorescent resin for detecting gastric cancer in patients. We report the first case using the clips to accurately locate a site of interest. Alpha-fetoprotein-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) and hepatoid adenocarcinoma of stomach (HAS) are rare types of gastric cancer, with specific clinical manifestations and poor prognosis. The standardized treatment process of such cancers remains elusive. We aim to investigate the efficacy of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy on patients with AFPGC or HAS.\\nAFPGC and HAS patients who underwent immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy as the first-line treatment at our institute from June 2016 to December 2018 were enrolled in this observational study. Their clinicopathological characteristics, serum AFP level and treatment methods were collected. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed and compared between patients who received immunotherapy plus chemotherapy and those received chemotherapy.\\nA total of 21 patients with advanced AFPGC or HAS were included in the study and the median follow-up time was 28.0 months. Of the 21 patients, 7 patients received immunotherapy of PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) plus chemotherapy and 14 patients as control received chemotherapy with or without Herceptin/Apatinib. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) time was 5.0 months (4.3 months in the control group and 22.0 months in the immunotherapy group). The median overall survival (mOS) time of the control group was 16.0 months (14.0 months in chemotherapy alone subgroup, 20.0 months in chemotherapy plus Apatinib or Herceptin subgroup), while the mOS of patients receiving immunotherapy was not reached.\\nThis study suggested PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy could benefit AFPGC and HAS patients. Its mechanism of action warrants further investigation. The Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome that affects 1/3000-1/4000 individuals. Patients with this condition are predisposed to different tumors, like neurofibromas, optic nerve gliomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and breast cancers.\\nA 78-year-old female patient affected by NF1 in May 2018 during follow-up for a carcinoma of the right breast had persistent anemia requiring regular blood transfusions. She presented with NF 1 with disseminated cutaneous neurofibromas, asthma, hypothyroidism, arterial hypertension and uterine prolapse. She had performed gastroscopy and colonoscopy both negative for neoplastic lesions. She was subjected to chest and abdomen CT which revealed the presence of an ileal lesion of 6.5 × 4 cm suspected of GIST. The patient underwent laparoscopic ileal resection in 120 min and was discharged on the sixth postoperative day.\\nNF1 is caused by biallelic loss of a tumor suppressor gene. Most GISTs are localized in the stomach and small intestine. Surgery is the first line of treatment for localized disease. The main goal of surgery is complete excision with negative margins. The association between breast cancer and intestinal GIST in NF1 is reported only from two previous studies.\\nIt is a rare case of association of breast cancer and ileal GIST in NF1. Laparoscopic resection of intestinal GIST has shown in some studies to have oncological outcomes comparable to laparotomy. Furthermore, laparoscopy is associated with better perioperative outcomes and shorter hospital stays. Further studies with a higher level of evidence are needed. Data regarding the incidence and prognostic impact of immune-related imaging changes, assessed by \\nTo evaluate the role of PET/CT to visualize the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) following pembrolizumab.\\nFrom February 2017 to August 2019, in 103 patients with nonmetastatic, clinical T2-4aN0M0 bladder cancer, PET/CT scan was performed before and after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (N = 206 scans), before radical cystectomy.\\nPET/CT before and after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, before radical cystectomy.\\nWe analyzed the occurrence of irAEs, evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, against the development of inflammatory FDG uptake described at PET/CT (irAEs + PET/CT). Logistic regression analyses evaluated the association between irAEs + PET/CT and the pathological response to pembrolizumab. Kaplan-Meier curves tested their association with progression-free survival (PFS) after pembrolizumab and radical cystectomy.\\nForty patients (39%) developed irAEs + PET/CT in several target organs. The most frequent target organs were the thyroid (N = 18), stomach (N = 14), mediastinal lymph nodes (N = 9), and lung (N = 5). These changes were clinically evident in 18 (45%) and were not associated with the pathological response, neither in terms of complete response (ypT0N0, p = 0.07) nor as downstaging to ypT≤1N0 disease (p = 0.1), although ypT0N0 responses were numerically more frequent in patients with irAEs+ PET/CT (47.5% vs 32%). Furthermore, irAE+ PET/CT events were associated with longer, not statistically significant, 24-mo PFS: 88.3% versus 76.5% (p = 0.5). Our results warrant further validation in larger datasets.\\nWe presented unique surrogate data of PET/CT that could help improve our understanding of nonclinically evident effects of ICI administration, especially in patients at the early disease stage.\\nWe evaluated the utility of PET/CT to visualize the occurrence of inflammatory changes after pembrolizumab in patients with localized bladder cancer without metastases. After immunotherapy, 39% of the patients developed  To compare the short-term clinical effects between totally laparoscopic radical gastrectomy with modified Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and laparoscopic-assisted radical gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis; to explore the safety, feasibility and short-term effect of totally laparoscopic radical gastrectomy with modified Roux-en-Y anastomosis.\\nData of 75 patients who underwent totally laparoscopic radical gastrectomy with modified Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and 95 patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted radical gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis by the same surgical team were analyzed. During the modified Roux-en-Y anastomosis, the stomach separation and regional lymph node dissection were completed under a laparoscope; the specimen was placed in a bag; gastrojejunostomy was completed; the subumbilicus hole was enlarged to 3 cm; the specimen was taken out; then, the proximal and distal ends of the small intestine were moved outside of the abdominal wall to complete the small intestine-small intestine end-to-side anastomosis.\\nAll 170 operations were successful. The differences in the time of anastomosis and the number of dissected lymph nodes between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05), but in the totally-MA group the amount of bleeding and the length of incision significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The recovery time as measured by breathing unassisted, drinking fluids and getting out of bed was significantly shorter than those in the laparoscopic-assisted group (P < 0.05), and the pain score 1 day after surgery was significantly lower than that of the laparoscopic-assisted group (P < 0.05). One case of duodenal stump leakage and 1 case of esophagojejunostomy leakage were found in the laparoscopic-assisted group. In the totally-MA group, there were no complications such as anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis or anastomotic bleeding, but 2 patients with double primary carcinoma underwent joint radical resection.\\nCompared with laparoscopic-assisted surgery, totally laparoscopic radical gastrectomy with modified Roux-en-Y anastomosis has the advantages of being safer and less traumatic, with associated reductions in bleeding and pain. (1) Background: Previous reports have indicated that cancers of the stomach, lung, and pancreas can be detected by dog sniffing, but results have been varied. Here, a highly trained dog was used to determine whether urine from patients with cervical premalignant lesions and malignant tumors have a cancer-specific scent. (2) Methods: A total of 195 urine samples were collected from patients with cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3), benign uterine diseases, and healthy volunteers. Each test was performed using one urine sample from a cancer patient and four samples from different controls. Each of the five urine samples was placed in a separate box. When the cancer sniffing dog stopped and sat in front of the box with a sample from a cancer patient, the test was considered as positive. (3) Results: 83 patients with cervical cancer (34 cases of cervical cancer and 49 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3), 49 patients with uterine benign diseases, and 63 healthy volunteers were enrolled, and their urine samples were collected. In 83 times out of 83 runs in a double-blind test, the trained dog could correctly identify urine samples of cervical cancer patients. (4) Conclusion: A trained dog could accurately distinguish the urine of all patients with cervical cancer or CIN3, regardless of the degree of cancer progression. D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer is technically demanding and requires clearance of the lymph node stations along the main arteries that irrigate the stomach and the liver. As gastric and hepatic irrigation have a different pattern from the classic branching of the celiac trunk in approximately 25% of patients, acquaintance with these variations and knowledge on how to adequately perform the lymphadenectomy in different anatomic settings is of utmost importance for surgeons who manage gastric cancer.1 METHODS: This video demonstrates, step-by-step, how to perform D2 lymphadenectomy in accordance with gastric and hepatic irrigation. Illustrations of the arterial variation correlate with the corresponding computed tomography image and operative management of the lymph node stations.\\nD2 lymphadenectomy is the standard of care in advanced gastric cancer.2 It implies clearing the lymph node stations along the celiac trunk, left gastric artery, and common and proper hepatic arteries. However, the celiac trunk and hepatic irrigation are highly variable and surgeons must be aware of how to properly and safely address the lymph node stations in all scenarios. Vessel anatomical variations increase the risk of vascular injuries and its complications, such as bleeding, necrosis, liver function impairment, liver necrosis, and conversion to open surgery.3-5 Additionally, the lymphadenectomy cannot be compromised if a variation is found.6 Preoperative knowledge of the gastric blood supply also shortens the surgical duration.7 CONCLUSIONS: The present video demonstrates how to recognize the most common variations found during D2 gastrectomy, and provides strategies to adequately approach them. No reliable method has been reported for determining tumor budding with frozen sections during surgical procedures. This study investigated endoscopic features predictive of tumor budding in early gastric cancers (EGC).\\nThis retrospective study evaluated data from 137 patients diagnosed with EGC who underwent endoscopy, followed by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD); 71 patients underwent a second gastrectomy. Based on pathological analyses, lesions were categorized as being positive (n\\u2009=\\u200980) or negative for tumor budding (n\\u2009=\\u200957). Endoscopic features were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Patient survival rates were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.\\nMean age of our study population was 66\\xa0years (range, 31-86\\xa0years). The tumor budding-positive cohort (73.3\\u2009±\\u20095.9\\xa0years) was significantly older than the tumor budding-negative cohort (56.7\\u2009±\\u20097.6\\xa0years) (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Endoscopic features significantly different between tumor budding-positive and budding-negative groups included tumor size (p\\u2009=\\u20090.003), remarkable redness (p\\u2009=\\u20090.015), and margin elevation (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Tumor size (odds ratio (OR): 1.561; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.984, 2.285; p\\u2009=\\u20090.047) and margin elevation (OR: 2.141; 95% CI: 1.147, 5.117; p\\u2009=\\u20090.003) were independent predictors of tumor budding. Margin elevation was found in 19.3% of tumor budding-negative and 53.8% of budding-positive cases. In the tumor budding-positive group, ESD and second gastrectomy were associated with disease-free survival.\\nMargin elevation and large tumor size (>\\u200929\\xa0mm) of EGCs on endoscopy are promising imaging biomarkers for predicting tumor budding in EGCs. ESD and a second gastrectomy can be better for tumor budding-positive patients with EGCs. Adipose tissue is a highly dynamic endocrine tissue and constitutes a central node in the interorgan crosstalk network through adipokines, which cause pleiotropic effects, including the modulation of angiogenesis, metabolism, and inflammation. Specifically, digestive cancers grow anatomically near adipose tissue. During their interaction with cancer cells, adipocytes are reprogrammed into cancer-associated adipocytes and secrete adipokines to affect tumor cells. Moreover, the liver is the central metabolic hub. Adipose tissue and the liver cooperatively regulate whole-body energy homeostasis via adipokines. Obesity, the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue due to hyperplasia and hypertrophy, is currently considered a global epidemic and is related to low-grade systemic inflammation characterized by altered adipokine regulation. Obesity-related digestive diseases, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett\\'s esophagus, esophageal cancer, colon polyps and cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis-related diseases, cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and diabetes, might cause specific alterations in adipokine profiles. These patterns and associated bases potentially contribute to the identification of prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches for the associated digestive diseases. This review highlights important findings about altered adipokine profiles relevant to digestive diseases, including hepatic, pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and biliary tract diseases, with a perspective on clinical implications and mechanistic explorations. Gastric cancer belongs to the heterogeneous malignancies and, according to the World Health Organization, it is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the role of natural products of plant origin in the therapy of gastric cancer and to present the potentially active metabolites which can be used in the natural therapeutical strategies as the support to the conventional treatment. Many of the naturally spread secondary metabolites have been proved to exhibit chemopreventive properties when tested on the cell lines or in vivo. This manuscript aims to discuss the pharmacological significance of both the total extracts and the single isolated metabolites in the stomach cancer prevention and to focus on their mechanisms of action. A wide variety of plant-derived anticancer metabolites from different groups presented in the manuscript that include polyphenols, terpenes, alkaloids, or sulphur-containing compounds, underlines the multidirectional nature of natural products. Perioperative oral management has been reported to be effective for preventing postoperative infectious complications. In addition, severe periodontal disease was identified as the significant risk factor for complications after gastrointestinal surgery. We investigated the bacteriological association between the periodontal pocket, stomach mucosa and drainage fluid to determine whether oral bacteria directly cause intra-abdominal infection after gastrectomy.\\nPatients who were scheduled to undergo surgery for gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled. We evaluated the similarity of bacterial strains in periodontal pocket, stomach mucosa and fluid from drainage tube. Gingival crevicular fluid and dental plaque were collected from the periodontal pocket and cultured to detect bacteria. Specimens from the resected stomach were collected and used for bacterial culturing. Drainage fluid from the abdominal cavity was also cultured.\\nAll of 52 patients were enrolled. In the periodontal pocket, α-Streptococcus spp., Neisseria sp., and Prevotella sp. were mainly detected. Bacterial cultures in the stomach mucosa were positive in 26 cases. In 20 cases (76.9%), the detected strains were the same as those in the periodontal pocket. Six patients had the postoperative intra-abdominal infection after gastrectomy, and the same bacterial strains was detected in both of drainage fluid and periodontal pocket in two patients with severe periodontal disease.\\nWe found the bacteriological association that same strain detected in periodontal pocket, stomach and in intra-abdominal drainage fluid after gastrectomy in patients with periodontal disease. MicroRNA-451 (miR-451) is lowly expressed in stomach cancer cells and improves their metastatic ability by down-regulating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). Many studies have found that caveolin-1 (CAV1) plays an important role in cancer progression. Additionally, miR-451 has been reported to regulate the expression of CAV1 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore, this study aims to determine if miR-451 regulates the biological functions of stomach cancer cells by regulating CAV1 expression. Through a bioinformatics analysis, we found that miR-451a regulates CAV1 expression, and miR-451a expression is relatively low in stomach cancer cells. Next, we confirmed that miR-451a negatively regulates CAV1 expression using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Then MTT, 5-ethynyl-2\\'-deoxyuridine (EdU), propidium iodide (PI), an Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit, and transwell assays were used to measure the changes in cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis, cell migration, and invasiveness in stomach cancer cells overexpressing miR-451a or both miR-451a and CAV1. It was found that increasing the miR-451a expression in stomach cancer cells inhibits cell growth, migration, and invasiveness, and promotes apoptosis. After restoring the CAV1 expression, these biological processes resumed. In summary, in stomach cancer cells, the overexpression of miR-451a can restrain cell growth and promote apoptosis, so it is a potential treatment for stomach cancer. With advances in diagnostic imaging techniques of gastric cancer screening with X-ray fluoroscopy, it has been suggested that mucosal projections induced by the vessels distributed in the submucosal layer of the stomach may be mistaken for abnormal mucosal folds. In this study, we aimed to describe the distribution of blood vessels in the submucosal layer of the stomach to improve the diagnostic accuracy of screening of gastric cancer.\\nTwenty-four stomachs from Japanese cadavers were used in this study. Uncolored or colored contrast agents were injected into arteries and/or veins for macroscopic analyses, X-ray imaging, and methyl salicylate clearing. In addition, histological analysis was performed to examine blood vessels distributed inside the stomach wall.\\nFollowing contrast agent injection, thick\\xa0blood vessels were distributed perpendicular to both curvature sides, and branches parallel to both curvature sides flowed from these thick blood vessels, and a vascular network was formed throughout the stomach wall. This vascular network had intra-mural anastomoses connecting both curvature sides. Moreover, in histological analyses, blood vessels depicted by injection were mainly distributed in the submucosal layer.\\nThis study strongly suggests that the mucosal projections induced by arteries and veins in the submucosal layer could be mistaken for abnormal mucosal folds. Therefore, a better understanding of the vascular distribution in the submucosal layer is important to improve diagnostic accuracy from imaging studies of the stomach. The information provided by this research may facilitate better accuracy in diagnosis and reduce the number of unnecessary invasive procedures. Quality of life (QOL) has become important in the trend of emphasizing patient satisfaction. This study aimed to evaluate the QOL in patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic gastrectomy for gastric cancer.\\nA prospective trial was performed involving patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic gastrectomy for primary gastric cancer at 11 hospitals in Korea. Within this comparative trial, QOL, postoperative pain, and long-term complications were exanimated. The quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-STO22 developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer were used for the QOL survey. We compared the data after dividing it into several types of characteristics as follows; device (robotic or laparoscopic), operation type, pathological stage, and sex. Biased components were extracted by logistic regression analysis. Propensity score matching was applied to the data set with the biased components.\\nIn total, 434 patients (211 for laparoscopic surgery and 223 for robotic surgery) were enrolled, out of which 321 patients who responded to both preoperative and postoperative surveys were selected for analysis. Robotic gastrectomy was not different from laparoscopic gastrectomy with respect to postoperative QOL. Distal gastrectomy showed better scores than total gastrectomy in terms of role functioning, social functioning, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, constipation, financial difficulties, dysphagia, eating restrictions, anxiety, taste, and body image. Male patients showed better scores on the 19 scales compared to female patients.\\nRobotic and laparoscopic approaches for gastric cancer surgery did not differ from each other with respect to QOL. Distal gastrectomy resulted in better QOL than total gastrectomy. While endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is recognized as a minimally invasive standard treatment for differentiated early gastric cancers (EGCs), it has not been indicated for undifferentiated EGC (UD-EGC) because of a relatively high risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). However, patients with surgically resected mucosal (cT1a) UD-EGC\\u2009≤\\u20092\\xa0cm in size with no lymphovascular invasion or ulceration are reported to be at a very low risk of LNM. This multicenter, single-arm, confirmatory trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD for UD-EGC.\\nThe key eligibility criteria were endoscopically diagnosed cT1a/N0/M0, single primary lesion, size\\u2009≤\\u20092\\xa0cm, no ulceration and histologically proven components of undifferentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Based on the histological findings after ESD, additional gastrectomy was indicated if the criteria for curative resection were not satisfied. The subjects of the primary analysis were patients with UD-EGC as the dominant component. The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival (OS) of patients with UD-EGC.\\nThree hundred 46 patients were enrolled from 49 institutions. The proportion of en bloc resection was 99%. No ESD-related Grade 4 adverse events were noted. Delayed bleeding and intraoperative and delayed perforation occurred in 25 (7.3%), 13 (3.8%), and 6 (1.7%) patients, respectively. Among the 275 patients who were the subjects of the primary analysis, curative resection was achieved in 195 patients (71%), and 5-year OS was 99.3% (95% CI: 97.1-99.8).\\nESD can be a curative and less invasive treatment for UD-EGC for patients meeting the eligibility criteria of this study. There is some evidence suggesting a link between BRCA1/2 germline mutations and increased risk of gastric cancer.\\nEndoscopic screening for stomach malignancies was performed in 120 BRCA1 mutation carriers in order to evaluate the probability of detecting the tumor disease.\\nNo instances of gastric cancer were revealed at the first visit. The analysis of atrophic changes performed by OLGA (Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment) criteria revealed that OLGA stages I-IV alterations were observed in 26 of 41 (63%) subjects aged >50 years as compared to 29 of 79 (37%) in younger subjects (p = 0.007, χ2 test). One BRCA1 mutation carrier developed gastric cancer 4 years after the first visit for endoscopic examination. We performed next-generation sequencing analysis for this tumor and additional 4 archival gastric cancers obtained from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Somatic loss of the remaining BRCA1/2 allele was observed in 3 out of 5 tumors analyzed; all of these carcinomas, but none of the malignancies with the retained BRCA1/2 copy, showed chromosomal instability.\\nTaken together, these data justify further studies on the relationships between the BRCA1/2 and gastric cancer. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and has a risk of late recurrence. We report a case of metastasis to the stomach and colon 23\\xa0years after surgery, with characteristic findings. A 74-year-old woman underwent breast cancer resection at the age of 51. At the time, no additional therapy was performed despite the histological diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which was performed as a follow-up for her chronic gastritis, revealed multiple erosions. Histology revealed diffuse proliferation of signet ring cell-like atypical cells, that were positive for cytokeratin CAM5.2 and estrogen receptor. These findings suggested metastasis from the invasive lobular breast carcinoma. Positron-emission tomography revealed sternal and vertebral metastases. Colonoscopy also performed to screen for intestinal metastasis revealed several lesions that resembled hyperplastic polyps. Although these lesions were not strongly suspected of metastasis, histology surprisingly revealed the same findings as the gastric metastasis. This case involved gastric and colorectal superficial metastases that were synchronously detected 23\\xa0years after primary treatment. We report that early-stage colorectal metastasis may resemble hyperplastic polyps, and biopsy should always be considered in patients with a history of breast cancer, regardless of years elapsed since treatment. Conventional positron emission tomography can be used only preoperatively to identify lymph node metastases, and hence, these growths are difficult to locate intraoperatively. Previously, an intraoperative laparoscopic coincidence imaging system, with an external fixed detector array and a detector probe that can be moved and inserted into the stomach, was proposed to identify lymph node metastases during stomach cancer surgery. This paper proposes a prototype detector for this system.\\nGAGG:Ce (Gd\\nThe spatial resolution of the reconstructed images in lateral direction was better than 7\\xa0mm, but that of depth direction was limited, owing to inadequate projections. The prototype successfully reconstructed 44\\xa0kBq \\nWe developed a prototype detector for an intraoperative laparoscopic coincidence imaging system. The prototype detector was evaluated successfully, and the produced images were similar to those obtained in the simulation results, thereby suggesting that this method offers a new possibility of imaging lymph node metastases intraoperatively. Whole-body imaging of mice is a key source of information for research. Organ segmentation is a prerequisite for quantitative analysis but is a tedious and error-prone task if done manually. Here, we present a deep learning solution called AIMOS that automatically segments major organs (brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, bladder, stomach, intestine) and the skeleton in less than a second, orders of magnitude faster than prior algorithms. AIMOS matches or exceeds the segmentation quality of state-of-the-art approaches and of human experts. We exemplify direct applicability for biomedical research for localizing cancer metastases. Furthermore, we show that expert annotations are subject to human error and bias. As a consequence, we show that at least two independently created annotations are needed to assess model performance. Importantly, AIMOS addresses the issue of human bias by identifying the regions where humans are most likely to disagree, and thereby localizes and quantifies this uncertainty for improved downstream analysis. In summary, AIMOS is a powerful open-source tool to increase scalability, reduce bias, and foster reproducibility in many areas of biomedical research. Although socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with cancer risk, little research on this association has been done in Japan. To evaluate the association between SES and digestive tract cancer risk, we conducted a case-control study for head and neck, esophageal, stomach, and colorectal cancers in 3188 cases and the same number of age- and sex-matched controls within the framework of the Hospital-based Epidemiological Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center III (HERPACC III). We employed the education level and areal deprivation index (ADI) as SES indicators. The association was evaluated with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders. Even after allowance for known cancer risk factors, the education level showed linear inverse associations with head and neck, stomach, and colorectal cancers. Compared to those educated to junior high school, those with higher education showed statistically significantly lower risks of cancer (0.43 (95% CI: 0.27-0.68) for head and neck, 0.52 (0.38-0.69) for stomach, and 0.52 (0.38-0.71) for colorectum). Consistent with these results for the educational level, the ADI in quintiles showed positive associations with head and neck, esophageal, and stomach cancers ( The aim of this research was to identify the clinicopathological characteristics of early gastric cancer (EGC) based on the WHO criteria, and to analyze predictors for lymph node metastasis (LNM) in EGC in a Chinese study population.\\nWe retrospectively collected data of 304 Chinese EGC patients, including 265 patients undergoing radical gastrectomy and 39 patients undergoing endoscopic resection. Histological features were accessed by three experienced pathologists. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used to identify the correlation between clinicopathological features and LNM.\\nAmong the 304 cases with EGC, the rate of well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma was 11.2%, significantly lower than that of Japanese and South Korean, which was 24.8% and 19.9% respectively (p<0.001 and p\\xa0=\\xa00.006), but similar to that of a Western result, which was 11.9% (p\\xa0=\\xa00.860). Among the 265 patients who underwent gastrectomy, 18.5% of the patients had LNM. Univariate analysis showed that macroscopic type, differentiation degree, invasion depth, infiltration pattern (INF), lymphovascular invasion and ulceration were related to LNM. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymphovascular invasion (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001, OR\\xa0=\\xa06.549), ulceration (p\\xa0=\\xa00.035, OR\\xa0=\\xa02.527) and INF c (p\\xa0=\\xa00.042, OR\\xa0=\\xa03.424) were the independent risk factors of LNM in EGC.\\nThe pathological diagnosis standard of well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in China significantly differs from that in Japan and South Korea, but is similar to western countries. LNM is more likely to occur in EGCs with lymphovascular invasion, ulceration and INF c. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is clinically used to remove early gastric cancer in stomach. The aim of the current study is to examine a therapeutic capacity of pulsed Ho:YAG laser for the development of laser-assisted ESD under various surgical parameters. Ex vivo porcine stomach tissue was ablated with 1-J Ho:YAG pulses at 10 Hz at different number of treatments (NT = 1, 2, and 3) and treatment speeds (TS = 0.5, 1, and 2 mm/s) without and with saline injection. Regardless of saline injection, straight tissue ablation showed that ablation depth increased with increasing NT and decreasing TS. At NT = 3 and TS = 0.5 mm/s, no saline injection yielded the maximum ablation depth (3.4 ± 0.3 mm), partially removing muscularis propria. However, saline injection confined the tissue ablation within a submucosal layer (2.1 ± 0.3 mm). Thermal injury was found to be 0.7~1.1 mm in the adjacent tissue with superficial carbonization. Circular tissue ablation (2 cm in diameter) at NT = 3 and TS = 0.5 mm/s presented that no saline injection yielded a reduction in the lesion area, whereas saline injection maintained the ablated lesion area. Histological analysis revealed that unlike no saline injection, saline injection ablated the entire mucosal layer without perforation in the muscular propria. The pulsed Ho:YAG laser can be a potential surgical tool for clinical ESD to incise a target lesion without adverse perforation. Further investigations will validate the efficacy and safety of the Ho:YAG laser-assisted ESD in in vivo porcine stomach models for clinical translation. Radiographic triage measures in patients with new advanced ovarian cancer have yielded inconsistent results.\\nTo determine the correlation between surgeon radiology assessment and laparoscopic scoring by disease sites in patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage ovarian cancer.\\nFourteen gynecologic oncology surgeons from a single institution performed a blinded review of pre-operative contrast-enhanced CT imaging from patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer. Each of the patients had also undergone laparoscopic scoring assessment, between April 2013 and December 2017, to determine primary resectability using the validated Fagotti scoring method, and assigned a predictive index value score. Surgeons were asked to provide expected predictive index value scores based on their blinded review of the antecedent CT imaging. Linear mixed models were conducted to calculate the correlation between radiologic and laparoscopic score for surgeons individually, and as a group. Once the model was fit, the inter-class correlation and 95% CI were calculated.\\nRadiology review was performed on 20 patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer who underwent laparoscopic scoring assessment. Surgeon faculty rank included assistant professor (n=5), associate professor (p=4), and professor (n=5). The kappa inter-rater agreement was -0.017 (95% CI -0.023 to -0.005), indicating low inter-rater agreement between radiology review and actual laparoscopic score. The inter-class correlation in this model was 0.06 (0.02-0.21), indicating that surgeons do not score the same across all the images. When using a clinical cut-off point for the predictive index value of 8, the probability of agreement between radiology and actual laparoscopic score was 0.56 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.73). Examination of disease site sub-scales showed that the probability of agreement was as follows: peritoneum 0.57 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.62), diaphragm 0.54 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.60), mesentery 0.51 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.57), omentum 0.61 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.67), bowel 0.54 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.64), stomach 0.71 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.76), and liver 0.36 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.42). The number of laparoscopic scoring cases, tumor reductive surgery cases, or faculty rank was not significantly associated with overall or sub-scale agreement.\\nSurgeon radiology review did not correlate highly with actual laparoscopic scoring assessment findings in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer. Our study highlights the limited accuracy of surgeon radiographic assessment to determine resectability. None The SOX family proteins are proved to play a crucial role in the development of the lymphatic ducts and the cardiovascular system. Moreover, an increased expression level of the SOX18 protein has been found in many malignances, such as melanoma, stomach, pancreatic breast and lung cancers. Another SOX family protein, the SOX30 transcription factor, is responsible for the development of male germ cells. Additionally, recent studies have shown its proapoptotic character in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Our preliminary studies showed a disparity in the amount of mRNA of the   \\u2002Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a technically difficult and time-consuming procedure. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ESD using a multibending endoscope to treat superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms.\\n\\u2002Patients with a single early gastric cancer who met the absolute or expanded indications for ESD according to the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines were enrolled and randomly assigned to undergo ESD using a conventional endoscope (C-ESD) or a multibending endoscope (M-ESD). Randomization was stratified by ESD operator experience and tumor location. The primary outcome was ESD procedure time, calculated as the time from the start of submucosal injection to complete removal of the tumor.\\n\\u200260 patients were analyzed (30 C-ESD, 30 M-ESD). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) ESD procedure times for M-ESD and C-ESD were 34.6 (SD 17.2) and 47.2 (SD 26.7) minutes, respectively (\\n\\u2002ESD procedure time was significantly shorter with the multibending endoscope and fewer muscles were damaged. We recommend multibending endoscopy for ESD in the upper and middle thirds of the stomach to reduce procedure time and incidence of complications. Cardiometabolic abnormalities are a leading cause of death among women, including women with cancer.\\nThis study examined the association between prediagnosis cardiovascular health and total and cause-specific mortality among 12,076 postmenopausal women who developed local- or regional-stage invasive cancer in the Women\\'s Health Initiative (WHI). Cardiovascular risk factors included waist circumference, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Obesity-related cancers included breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for important predictors of survival.\\nAfter a median follow-up of 10.0 years from the date of the cancer diagnosis, there were 3607 total deaths, with 1546 (43%) due to cancer. Most participants (62.9%) had 1 or 2 cardiometabolic risk factors, and 8.1% had 3 or 4. In adjusted models, women with 3 to 4 risk factors (vs none) had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.73-2.30), death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.88-5.57), cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.1-1.72), and other-cause mortality (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.70-2.69). A higher waist circumference was associated with greater all-cause mortality (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.30) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.42).\\nAmong postmenopausal women diagnosed with cancer in the WHI, cardiometabolic risk factors before the cancer diagnosis were associated with greater all-cause, CVD, cancer-specific, and other-cause mortality. These results raise hypotheses regarding potential clinical intervention strategies targeting cardiometabolic abnormalities that require future prospective studies for confirmation.\\nThis study uses information from the Women\\'s Health Initiative (WHI) to find out whether cardiac risk factors are related to a greater risk of dying among older women with cancer. The WHI is the largest study of medical problems faced by older women in this country. The results show that women who have 3 or 4 risk factors are more likely to die of any cause, heart disease, or cancer in comparison with women with no risk factors. It is concluded that interventions to help to lower the burden of cardiac risk factors can have an important impact on survivorship among women with cancer. High-quality documentation of dumping symptoms after esophagectomy is currently limited. The aim of the study was to describe the incidence of symptoms associated with dumping syndrome and their relationship with health-related quality of life after esophagectomy.\\nThe study cohort was identified from prospective IRB-approved databases from two high-volume esophagectomy centers. Patients that were alive and without evidence of recurrence in April 2018 completed the validated Dumping Symptom Rating Scale and health-related quality of life questionnaires. Compound dumping symptom score was created by combining the individual scores for severity and frequency for each symptom.\\nIn total, 171 patients who underwent esophagectomy 1995-2017 responded to the questionnaires, corresponding to a response rate of 77.0%. Median age was 66 years and median time from operation to survey was 5.5 years. Absent or mild problems in all nine dumping symptoms were reported by 94 (59.5%) patients; 19 (12.0%) patients reported moderate or severe problems in at least three symptoms, the most common being postprandial \"need to lie down,\" \"diarrhea,\" and \"stomach cramps.\" Increasing compound dumping symptom score was associated with significantly decreased function scores in all aspects of health-related quality of life except physical functioning (P < 0.005).\\nEsophagectomy has the potential to change long-term eating patterns; however, the majority of patients in the study did not have severe postoperative dumping symptoms. On the other hand, moderate-to-severe dumping symptoms, which were reported by 12% of patients in this study, were strongly associated with decreased health-related quality of life. Abdominal pain related to gastrointestinal malignancy can be notoriously difficult to manage and can lead to significant morbidity and suffering. The blockade of the celiac plexus has traditionally been performed for alleviating abdominal pain related to malignancy. Visceral structures that are innervated by these nerves include the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, mesentery, omentum, and the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach to the transverse colon. Alternatively, this pain can be treated by disrupting visceral nociceptive signals at the splanchnic nerves. In this report, we describe our experience of treating a 50-year-old male patient suffering from severe abdominal pain related to pancreatic cancer with multiple liver metastases. The patient failed medication management and had an international normalized ratio of 1.6, which was a concern for performing a celiac plexus block given the proximity of major vascular structures. The patient instead underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as well as alcohol neurolysis of the bilateral splanchnic nerves and obtained significant relief from the procedure. Chronic gastritis is characterized by inflammation in the gastric mucosa with a vicious circle in inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators. Stomach adenocarcinoma would occur in the metaplastic gastric mucosa of chronic gastritis. Sijunzi decoction is a famous classical formula for the treatment of chronic gastritis. Although previous studies revealed some functions of Sijunzi decoction in treating chronic gastritis, the underlying mechanisms have not been illustrated clearly. In this study, we used network pharmacology to investigate the mechanism of Sijunzi decoction in treating chronic gastritis. Firstly, online datasets TCMSP, SWISS, and DisGeNET were used to investigate the functional mechanism of Sijunzi decoction against chronic gastritis and 18 genes were identified as targets of Sijunzi decoction in chronic gastritis. These 18 genes can be categorized into immunologically related genes and cancer-related genes. GO analysis showed that the 18 target genes were mainly enriched in angiogenesis, nitric oxide biosynthetic process, ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, cellular response to drug, and MAPK cascade. So, Sijunzi decoction alleviated chronic gastritis by inhibiting the local inflammatory response. Furthermore, we also investigated the impact of Sijunzi decoction on the peripheral blood leukocytes with our own RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 11 chronic superficial gastritis patients. 102 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing RNA-seq data of chronic superficial gastritis patients with healthy control groups. After performing a functional analysis on 102 DEGs and Sijunzi decoction potential targets and taking the intersection of these pathways, we found that platelet activation, angiogenesis, and pathways in cancer were candidate target pathways regulated by Sijunzi decoction. Thus, Sijunzi decoction also alleviates chronic gastritis by suppressing inflammatory response of peripheral blood leukocytes. Our results showed that Sijunzi decoction can ameliorate the local gastric inflammation and inflammations in peripheral blood leukocytes and might also reduce the incidence of stomach cancer in chronic gastritis. Propofol is a common clinical intravenous anesthetic. In the last few years, studies have revealed that propofol not only has good anesthetic effect but also has certain anticancer effect. However, its role in stomach cancer (SC) and related mechanisms are still under investigation.\\nThis study was designed to determine the effect of propofol on SC and its related mechanisms.\\nPurchased SC cells were treated with propofol at different concentrations (5, 10, and 20 μg/mL), miR-205 overexpression, and YAP1 inhibition. Then, the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), Transwell, and flow cytometry were carried out to determine the biological behavior changes of treated cells and the expression of miR-205 and YAP1 after treatment.\\nPropofol (10 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL) inhibited the growth of SC cells and promoted their apoptosis, and overexpressing miR-205 or inhibiting YAP1 can exert the same effects. In addition, propofol (10μg/mL and 20μg/mL) up-regulated miR-205 in SC cells. The dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that YAP1 could be targeted and regulated by miR-205, and the rescue assay revealed that inhibiting miR-205 or overexpressing YAP1 could weaken the effect of propofol on the biological behaviors of SC cells.\\nPropofol can strongly suppress the proliferation and invasion of SC cells and induce their apoptosis via the miR-205/YAP1 axis. Objective To observe the effect of serum of SD rats lavaged by modified Zuojin decoction on the apoptosis and proliferation of human gastric cancer cells and its mechanism. Methods SD rats were gavaged with modified Zuojin decoction to prepare their sera. Human SGC-7901 and MKN-45 cells were cultured and treated with the sera (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400) mL/L. MTT assay was used to observe the effect of drug-containing serum on the proliferation of human gastric cancer cells. Immunofluorescence method was used to detect the expression of ki67 after treatment with the drug-containing serum. The effect of drug-containing serum on the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells was detected by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein levels of apoptosis-associated cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, BAX and Bcl2 in SGC-7901 and MKN-45 cells. Results The drug-containing serum significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of SGC-7901 and MKN-45 cells, and the positive rate of ki67 expression was significantly reduced. The levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and BAX proteins in SGC-7901 and MKN-45 cells increased and the levels of Bcl2 protein decreased. Conclusion The drug-containing serum can significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of human gastric cancer SGC-7901 and MKN-45 cells, and the mechanism may be related to the activation of mitochondrial pathways. Gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer is one of the most common malignancy worldwide. In unresectable or metastatic disease, the prognosis is poor and is generally less than a year. Standard front-line chemotherapy includes two- or three-drug regimens with the addition of trastuzumab in HER2-positive disease. With an increased understanding of the biology of cancer over the past few decades, targeted therapies have made their way into the treatment paradigm of many cancers. They been examined in the first- and second-line settings in the treatment of gastroesophageal cancer though has yielded few viable treatment options. One success is ramucirumab either as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel is the preferred choice in second-line therapy. While immunotherapy has been considered a breakthrough in oncology over the past decade, the response rates in gastric and gastroesophageal cancers have been relatively low compared to other cancers, resulting in its limited approval and mostly reserved for second-line therapy or beyond. In this article, we will review the standard first- and second-line treatment regimens. Furthermore, this article will review the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapy in treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal cancers. Lastly, we will touch upon future treatment strategies that are currently under investigation. Accumulating evidence has confirmed the potential prognostic value of examined lymph nodes (ELNs) in patients with gastric cancer (GC). However, there is currently no consensus on the threshold ELN number for predicting both stage migration and long-term survival, especially in patients with stage III GC. This study aimed to validate the need to increase the ELN count to improve its prognostic accuracy in node-negative patients with stage III GC after curative gastrectomy.\\nThis retrospective, population-based study analyzed the clinical data of 84 patients with node-negative stage III GC from three high-volume institutions in China and 196 cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program registry. The optimal number of ELNs was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Clinicopathological characteristics significantly related to survival were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Stratified analyses were adopted to assess the prognostic predictive ability of the identified optimal number of ELNs in different populations. Survival differences among subgroups were analyzed to assess the impact of ELN count on stage migration according to overall survival (OS) among GC patients.\\nThe optimal number of ELNs was >31 according to ROC analysis of patients with node-negative stage III GC who underwent gastrectomy. Multivariate analysis identified ELNs as an independent predictor of postoperative OS in patients with node-negative stage III GC in both the Chinese cohort [hazard ratio (HR) 0.235; P<0.001] and the SEER cohort (HR 0.421; P<0.010). Stratified analysis demonstrated that >31 ELNs was a prerequisite for accurate prognostic evaluation of patients with node-negative stage III GC, regardless of sex, tumor size, and other factors. Stage migration between pT4bN0M0 and pT4bN1M0 was detected in patients with >31 ELNs. A nomogram was created to predict OS among patients with node-negative stage III GC. These results were validated using data from the SEER cohort.\\nThe number of ELNs was significantly associated with prognosis in patients with stage III GC after gastrectomy with systemic lymphadenectomy in both the Chinese and SEER cohorts. The results suggest that >31 ELNs are required for an accurate prognostic evaluation in patients with GC, especially those with node-negative stage III GC. Prophylactic splenectomy has shown no inferiority for tumors not invading the greater curvature side. Despite this, the clinical impact of prophylactic splenectomy for proximal advanced gastric cancer is not clear. This review aimed to clarify the impact of splenectomy for advanced gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach.\\nA systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted based on PubMed and EMBASE databases. The following search terms were used: \"gastric cancer\" OR \"splenectomy\" OR upper third of the stomach\" OR preservation of the spleen.\\nOut of 765 articles, 18 studies (combined n=6,341) were included in the analysis. Four randomized controlled trials (RCT) and eight retrospective studies suggested the benefits of spleen-preserving gastrectomy. Six retrospective studies showed no significant benefit of spleen-preserving gastrectomy. Prophylactic splenectomy showed a close association with a higher incidence of postoperative morbidity (pancreatic fistula and anastomotic leakage) with no concomitant improvement in overall survival. Prophylactic splenectomy should not be routinely performed and RCTs are necessary to confirm the impact of splenectomy for cN(+) at the splenic hilum tumors and tumors invading the greater curvature. Patients with cancer often carry the dual burden of the cancer itself and other co-existing medical conditions. The problems associated with comorbidities among elderly cancer patients are more prominent compared with younger patients. This study aimed to identify common cancer-related comorbidities in elderly patients through routinely collected hospital discharge data and to use association rules to analyze the prevalence and patterns of these comorbidities in elderly cancer patients at different cancer sites. We collected the discharge data of 80,574 patients who were diagnosed with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colorectum, liver, lung, female breast, cervix, and thyroid between 2016 and 2018. The same number of non-cancer patients were randomly selected as the control group and matched with the case group by age and gender. The results showed that cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, digestive diseases, and anemia were the most common comorbidities in elderly patients with cancer. The comorbidity patterns differed based on the cancer site. Elderly patients with liver cancer had the highest risk of comorbidities, followed by lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, thyroid cancer, and reproductive cancer. For example, elderly patients with liver cancer had the higher risk of the comorbid infectious and digestive diseases, whereas patients with lung cancer had the higher risk of the comorbid respiratory system diseases. The findings can assist clinicians in diagnosing comorbidities and contribute to the allocation of medical resources. Gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), consisting of both large- and small-cell NECs, and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs), including mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs), are a group of high-grade malignancies. Few studies to date have reported clinical outcomes, including prognosis, in patients with these tumors. This study therefore evaluated the clinicopathologic outcomes and prognosis in patients with NECs and MANECs.\\nThis study included 36 patients diagnosed with gastric NECs, including 23 with large-cell and 13 with small-cell NECs, and 85 with MiNENs, including 70 with high-grade and 15 with intermediate-grade MiNENs. Clinical outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were assessed.\\nDFS was significantly poorer in patients with NEC than in patients with intermediate-grade MiNEN (\\nDFS is significantly poorer in patients with NEC than in patients with intermediate-grade MiNEN and significantly lower in patients with large-cell than small-cell NECs. Previous studies on the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) cancer and cholecystectomy remain inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate this relationship, albeit particularly between cholecystectomy and gastric cancer or colorectal cancer (CRC), and the risk factors of cancer among individuals who have undergone cholecystectomy in Korea.\\nIn total, 4,222 patients who underwent laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy at our institution between January 2006 and December 2013 were included. Patients who underwent cholecystectomy for gallbladder cancer or were undergoing surgery for GI, hepatic, or pancreatobiliary cancers were excluded, as were those who developed stomach cancer or CRC within a year of their cholecystectomy. The included patients were followed until July 20, 2020. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was used to calculate the relative risk of GI cancer in cholecystectomy patients.\\nThe median patient age (n = 3,588) at the time of cholecystectomy was 54.0 (range, 19-95) years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.04. The median follow-up period after cholecystectomy was 15.0 (range, 0-146) months. We found a 108% greater risk of CRC (SIR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-3.17) and 154% increased risk of CRC in females (SIR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.16-4.84). Based on multivariate analysis, an age of > 60 years was a significant risk factor for GI cancer in cholecystectomy patients.\\nCholecystectomy may increase risk of CRC, especially in females. Age was considered a risk factor of GI cancers in patients with history of cholecystectomy. Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of subsequent primary neoplasms (SPNs), but the risk of developing specific digestive SPNs beyond age 40 years remains uncertain. We investigated risks of specific digestive SPNs within the largest available cohort worldwide.\\nThe PanCareSurFup cohort includes 69 460 five-year survivors of childhood cancer from 12 countries in Europe. Risks of digestive SPNs were quantified using standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks and cumulative incidence.\\n427 digestive SPNs (214 colorectal, 62 liver, 48 stomach, 44 pancreas, 59 other) were diagnosed in 413 survivors. Wilms tumour (WT) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors were at greatest risk (SIR 12.1; 95% CI 9.6 to 15.1; SIR 7.3; 95% CI 5.9 to 9.0, respectively). The cumulative incidence increased the most steeply with increasing age for WT survivors, reaching 7.4% by age 55% and 9.6% by age 60 years (1.0% expected based on general population rates). Regarding colorectal SPNs, WT and HL survivors were at greatest risk; both seven times that expected. By age 55 years, 2.3% of both WT (95% CI 1.4 to 3.9) and HL (95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) survivors had developed a colorectal SPN-comparable to the risk among members of the general population with at least two first-degree relatives affected.\\nColonoscopy surveillance before age 55 is recommended in many European countries for individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer, but not for WT and HL survivors despite a comparable risk profile. Clinically, serious consideration should be given to the implementation of colonoscopy surveillance while further evaluation of its benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness in WT and HL survivors is undertaken. Nitrate is an inorganic compound that occurs naturally in all surface and groundwater, although higher concentrations tend to occur only where fertilizers are used on the land. The regulatory limit for nitrate in public drinking water supplies was set to protect against infant methemoglobinemia, but other health effects were not considered. Risk of specific cancers and congenital disabilities may be increased when the nitrate is ingested, and nitrate is reduced to nitrite, which can react with amines and amides by nitrosation to form N-nitroso compounds which are known animal carcinogens. This study aims to evaluate the association between nitrate ingested through drinking water and the risk of developing cancers in humans.\\nWe performed a systematic review following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Google Scholars in the time-frame from their inception to January 2020, for potentially eligible publications. STATA version 12.0 was used to conduct meta-regression and a two-stage meta-analysis.\\nA total of 48 articles with 13 different cancer sites were used for analysis. The meta-regression analysis showed stomach cancer had an association with the median dosage of nitrate from drinking water (t\\u2009=\\u20093.98, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0001, and adjusted R-squared = 50.61%), other types of cancers didn\\'t show any association. The first stage of meta-analysis showed there was an association only between the risk of brain cancer & glioma (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.24) and colon cancer (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.17) and nitrate consumption in the analysis comparing the highest ORs versus the lowest. The 2\\nThis study showed that there is an association between the intake of nitrate from drinking water and a type of cancer in humans. The effective way of controlling nitrate concentrations in drinking water is the prevention of contamination (water pollution). Further research work on this topic is needed. Dyslipidemia was associated with gastric adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumors, but its role in a more malignant entity, gastric cancer with neuroendocrine immunophenotypes (GCNEI), was unclarified. This study sought to explore the relationship between serum lipid levels and the biological behaviors of gastric cancer with neuroendocrine immunophenotypes (GCNEI).\\nPatients with neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), GC with NEC components (GC-NEC), or GC expressing NE marker(s) but no NE morphology (GC-NENM) were enrolled from three centers. Their preoperative serum lipid levels, demographic, and clinicopathological information were analyzed and compared with those of patients with pure adenocarcinoma (PAC) or a background population selected from 10,061 health-check people by propensity-score matching.\\nA total of 342 GCNEI patients were enrolled. Compared with the background population, total cholesterol (TCHO) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were lower in GCNEI. Compared with PAC, GC-NENM and GC-NEC showed lower triglyceride (TG) levels, while, carcinoma with NE morphology showed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Among GCNEI subtypes, GC-NEC differed from the others by higher LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels. A higher LDL-C level and(or) lower TG, HDL-C levels correlated to higher stages or large tumor sizes in GC-NENM, and a lower HDL-C level correlated to large tumor sizes in GC-NEC. A higher LDL-C level, lower TG, HDL-C, and non-HDL levels increased the risk of GC-NEC, and lower TG, and HDL-C levels increased the risk of GC-NENM and NEC.\\nGCNEI had distinct and heterogeneous serum lipid patterns, which correlated to tumor development and progression. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying allergens and parasite immunity and discover the stage-enriched gene expression of fish-borne zoonotic nematodes in the stomach, we used RNA-seq to study the transcriptome profiles of Anisakis pegreffii (Nematoda: Anisakidae, AP) in simulated gastric juice. Mobile L3 larvae were incubated in simulated medium at 37\\xa0°C in 5% CO The role of the selenoproteome, which is the collection of all proteins containing selenium in an organism, in cancer development, growth and progression requires further investigation, due to the importance of selenium in both cancer and immune system function. Data about the selenoproteome, including its differential expression, single nucleotide variations, copy number variations, methylation, pathways and overall survival (OS) in five leading types of cancer are available from the GSCALite website. Subsequent to the analysis of these datasets, it was revealed that there was increased expression of GPX3 in stomach adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, SELENOV in oesophageal carcinoma, GPX8 and GPX4 in colon adenocarcinoma, TXNRD1 and SEPHS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and GPX8 in lung adenocarcinoma were associated with poor survival. Decreased gene expression of SELENOP was indicated in liver hepatocellular carcinoma and GPX3, and SELENOW, SELENOK, SELENBP1 and SECISBP2 in lung adenocarcinoma were associated with a poor prognosis. OS data suggested that hypermethylation of GPX4 in colon adenocarcinoma, GPX8 in lung squamous cell carcinoma, GPX1 in stomach adenocarcinoma and GPX3 in lung adenocarcinoma was associated with low survival, as is hypomethylation of GPX5 in lung adenocarcinoma. The selenoproteome is heterogeneous, especially in its effect on the OS of patients with cancer. The present study demonstrated that the roles of GPX4 in colon adenocarcinoma, SCLY and SELENOV in oesophageal carcinoma, SEPHS1 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, SELENOK in lung cancer, as well as SELENOM and SELENOW in stomach adenocarcinoma requires further research. The present study may lead to the identification of novel biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets for use in the treatment of cancers, such as colon adenocarcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer and stomach adenocarcinoma. A 76-year-old Japanese man with a history of stomach cancer and chronic atrial fibrillation was referred to our department with left atrial thrombus. He had a history of gastric amyloidosis diagnosed by a pathological specimen of the stomach; however, further examination for amyloidosis was not performed. The patient displayed clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure and echocardiography showed a thick left ventricular wall. Since cardiac amyloidosis was suspected, the patient underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and  Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. It takes some time from chronic gastritis to develop in GC. Early detection of GC will help patients obtain timely treatment. Understanding disease evolution is crucial for the prevention and treatment of GC. Here, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system to detect abnormalities in the gastric mucosa. We identified normal mucosa, chronic gastritis, and intestinal-type GC: this is the most common route of gastric carcinogenesis. We integrated digitalizing histopathology of whole-slide images (WSIs), stain normalization, a deep CNN, and a random forest classifier. The staining variability of WSIs was reduced significantly through stain normalization, and saved the cost and time of preparing new slides. Stain normalization improved the effect of the CNN model. The accuracy rate at the patch-level reached 98.4%, and 94.5% for discriminating normal → chronic gastritis → GC. The accuracy rate at the WSIs-level for discriminating normal tissue and cancerous tissue reached 96.0%, which is a state-of-the-art result. Survival analyses indicated that the features extracted from the CNN exerted a significant impact on predicting the survival of cancer patients. Our CNN model disclosed significant potential for adjuvant diagnosis of gastric diseases, especially GC, and usefulness for predicting the prognosis. Detailed information on metastatic patterns in of patients with esophageal and gastric cancer is limited. Early recognition of metastases is important to avoid futile locoregional treatments. Furthermore, knowledge on metastatic patterns is necessary for further development of personalized treatment modalities.\\nTo gain insight into the metastatic pattern of gastroesophageal cancer.\\nA nationwide retrospective autopsy study of 3876 patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus or stomach between 1990 and 2017 was performed. Only patient with metastases were included for analysis. The metastatic pattern was analyzed according to the primary tumor location and histological subtype.\\nMetastatic disease was found in 268 esophageal and 331 gastric cancer patients. In esophageal cancer, the most common metastatic locations were liver (56%), distant lymph nodes (53%) and lung (50%). Esophageal AC showed more frequently metastases to the peritoneum and bone compared with esophageal SCC. In gastric cancer, the most common metastatic locations were distant lymph nodes (56%), liver (53%) and peritoneum (51%). Intestinal-type AC of the stomach showed metastases to the liver more frequently, whereas metastases to the bone, female reproductive organs and colorectum were observed more frequently in diffuse-type gastric AC.\\nThis study showed differences in metastatic patterns of patients with esophageal and gastric cancer according to the primary tumor location and histological subtype. Somatostatin receptor 2a (SSTR2a) is an important diagnostic marker of meningioma and neuroendocrine tumours and is frequently expressed in primary and metastatic non-keratinising nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NK-NPC). Since NK-NPC cases are considered a kind of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELCs) which originate from the nasopharynx, information on the expression profile of SSTR2a in LELC in other sites with squamous and glandular differentiations is still lacking. This study aimed to assess the expression of SSTR2a in LELC of various organs and clarify its expression profile.\\nExpression of SSTR2a in 164 cases of LELC was retrospectively analysed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues, including 146 cases of LELC with squamous differentiation (120 cases of the nasopharynx, 21 cases of the lung and 5 cases of the parotid gland) and 18 cases of LELC with glandular differentiation (15 cases of the stomach and 3 cases of the liver).\\nWe found that all (100%) cases of LELC of the lung (21/21) and parotid gland (5/5), and 93.3% (112/120) cases of LELC of the nasopharynx showed a diffused and strong expression of SSTR2a, while cases of gastric (0/15) and biliary (0/3) showed no SSTR2a expression.\\nSSTR2a is constantly expressed in LELC with squamous differentiation, but not expressed in LELC with glandular differentiation. However, the selective expression mechanism of SSTR2a remains unknown, which needs further investigation. Our novel findings might provide potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of LELC with squamous cell differentiation. Esophageal reconstruction using intestine is often performed for esophageal cancer patients in cases where the stomach cannot be used. We have previously performed reconstruction using ileocolon with supercharge and drainage as our 1st choice in those cases. However, a less invasive, simpler, and safer reconstructive technique using pedicled jejunal flap has recently become popular at our facility. When making the pedicled jejunal flap, the 1st jejunal vascular arcade was preserved, which in many cases allowed it to be pulled up to the cervical region by processing and transection up to the 2nd jejunal vascular branch. But supercharge and superdrainage may be required for pedicled jejunal flap reconstruction when blood flow of jejunal flap is not good condition. And free jejunal reconstruction is performed to reconstruction after cervical esophagectomy. Vascular anastomosis is essential for free jejunal reconstruction. This article describes the surgical technique and perioperative management of esophageal reconstruction with vascular anastomosis. The population prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) disease is unclear and difficult to assess in an asymptomatic population. The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of GI lesions in a largely asymptomatic population undergoing colon capsule endoscopy (CCE).\\nParticipants aged between 50-75years were retrieved from the Rotterdam Study, a longitudinal epidemiological study, between 2017-2019. Participants received CCE with bowel preparation. Abnormalities defined as clinically relevant were Barrett segment>3cm, severe ulceration, polyp>10 mm or ≥3 polyps in small bowel(SB) or colon, and cancer.\\nOf 2800 invited subjects, 462 (16.5%) participants (mean age 66.8 years, female 53.5%) ingested the colon capsule. A total of 451 videos were analyzed, and in 94.7% the capsule reached the descending colon. At least one abnormal finding was seen in 448 (99.3%) participants. The prevalence of abnormalities per GI segment, and the most common type of abnormality, were as follows: Esophageal 14.8% (Barrett\\'s esophagus <3 cm in 8.3%), gastric 27.9% (fundic gland polyps in 18.1%), SB abnormalities 33.9% (erosions in 23.8%), colon 93.3% (diverticula in 81.2%). A total of 54 participants (12%) had clinically relevant abnormalities, three (0.7%) in esophagus/stomach (reflux esophagitis grade D, Mallory Weiss lesion and severe gastritis), five (1.1%) in SB (polyps > 10 mm n= 4, severe ulcer n= 1,) and 46 (10.2%) in colon (polyp > 10 mm or ≥3 polyps n= 46, colorectal cancer n= 1).\\nGI lesions are very common in a mostly asymptomatic Western population, and clinically relevant lesions were found in 12% at CCE. These findings provide a frame of reference for the prevalence rates of GI lesions in the general population. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have limited efficacy in many tumors. We investigated mechanisms of tumor resistance to inhibitors of programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1, also called PD1) in mice with gastric cancer, and the role of its ligand, PDL1.\\nGastrin-deficient mice were given N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in drinking water along with Helicobacter felis to induce gastric tumor formation; we also performed studies with H/K-ATPase-hIL1B mice, which develop spontaneous gastric tumors at the antral-corpus junction and have parietal cells that constitutively secrete IL1B. Mice were given injections of an antibody against PD1 or an isotype control before tumors developed, or anti-PD1 and 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, or an antibody against lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G (also called Gr-1), which depletes myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs]), after tumors developed. We generated knockin mice that express PDL1 specifically in the gastric epithelium or myeloid lineage.\\nWhen given to gastrin-deficient mice before tumors grew, anti-PD1 significantly reduced tumor size and increased tumor infiltration by T cells. However, anti-PD1 alone did not have significant effects on established tumors in these mice. Neither early nor late anti-PD1 administration reduced tumor growth in the presence of MDSCs in H/K-ATPase-hIL1B mice. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin reduced MDSCs, increased numbers of intra-tumor CD8\\nIn mouse models of gastric cancer, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin reduce numbers of MDSCs to increase the effects of anti-PD1, which promotes tumor infiltration by CD8 Respiratory motion and the associated deformations of abdominal organs and tumors are essential information in clinical applications. However, inter- and intra-patient multi-organ deformations are complex and have not been statistically formulated, whereas single organ deformations have been widely studied. In this paper, we introduce a multi-organ deformation library and its application to deformation reconstruction based on the shape features of multiple abdominal organs. Statistical multi-organ motion/deformation models of the stomach, liver, left and right kidneys, and duodenum were generated by shape matching their region labels defined on four-dimensional computed tomography images. A total of 250 volumes were measured from 25 pancreatic cancer patients. This paper also proposes a per-region-based deformation learning using the non-linear kernel model to predict the displacement of pancreatic cancer for adaptive radiotherapy. The experimental results show that the proposed concept estimates deformations better than general per-patient-based learning models and achieves a clinically acceptable estimation error with a mean distance of 1.2 \\xa0±\\xa0 0.7\\xa0mm and a Hausdorff distance of 4.2 \\xa0±\\xa0 2.3\\xa0mm throughout the respiratory motion. The field of electroceuticals has attracted considerable attention over the past few decades as a novel therapeutic modality. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract (GIT) holds significant potential as a target for electroceuticals as the intersection of neural, endocrine, and immune systems. We review recent developments in electrical stimulation of various portions of the GIT (including esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestine) and nerves projecting to the GIT and supportive organs. This has been tested with varying degrees of success for several dysmotility, inflammatory, hormonal, and neurologic disorders. We outline a vision for the future of GI electroceuticals, building on advances in mechanistic understanding of GI physiology coupled with novel ingestible technologies. The next wave of electroceutical therapies will be minimally invasive and more targeted than current approaches, making them an indispensable tool in the clinical armamentarium. To determine whether the CT finding of overlying enhancing gastric mucosa (OEGM) can be used to predict risk stratifications by observing CT features of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the stomach.\\nClinical characteristics and CT features within pathologically demonstrated GISTs were retrospectively reviewed. Risk stratifications were classified into non-high group and high-risk group according to the modified National Institutes of Health criteria. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed in order to determine significant predictors for high-risk stratification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, subgroup analysis, and pathologic-radiologic correlation analysis were all executed.\\nA total of 147 patients were finally enrolled as test subjects. Within the univariate analysis, high-risk tumors tended to have a larger diameter, irregular shape, exophytic growth pattern, present necrosis, incomplete OEGM, tumor vessels, heterogeneous enhancement, and present rupture. According to ROC curve analysis, incomplete OEGM showed the largest area under curve values for diagnosing lesions (0.835; 95% CI, 0.766-0.904; p\\xa0<\\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the incomplete OEGM was the strongest independent predictor for high-risk stratification of gastric GISTs (OR\\u2009=\\u200921.944; 95% CI, 4.344-110.863; p\\xa0<\\u20090.001). Within the subgroup analysis, incomplete OEGM was more frequently associated with tumors size >\\u200910\\xa0cm, irregular shape, exophytic growth pattern, high mitotic count, and disrupted mucosa on pathology.\\nThe CT feature of incomplete OEGM is an independent predictive factor for high-risk stratification of gastric GISTs and strongly correlated with pathological mucosal changes.\\n• Preoperative CT features can be helpful in assessment of risk stratifications of gastric GISTs. • OEGM is an independent predictor for high-risk stratification of gastric GISTs. • Incomplete OEGM likely indicates high-risk stratification of gastric GISTs. To examine the feasibility of soliciting outcomes from adults who received chemotherapy treatment for cancer and describe the patterns and correlates of patient-reported toxicities.\\nPatient survey data from 29 Michigan ambulatory oncology practices collected in 2017.\\nSecondary analysis of patient survey data. Descriptive statistics were generated at the patient and practice levels. Thematic analysis of open-text comments identified clusters of frequently reported toxicities.\\nPatients completed 11 items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Using a 5-point Likert scale, patients rated the frequency of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain; the severity of nausea, vomiting, constipation, numbness/tingling, and pain; and how much numbness/tingling and pain interfered with usual or daily activities. Patients could also report two toxicities in open-text comments. Finally, patients reported unplanned health care service for toxicity or side effect management.\\nOf 3565 eligible patients, 2245 participated (63%) and 457 (20%) rated at least one toxicity as severe/very severe. Across practices, the proportion of patients who reported at least one severe/very severe toxicity ranged from 8% to 50%. Troubling toxicities included pain frequency (mean 2.3, SD 1.3), pain severity (2.1, 1.1), and diarrhea frequency (1.9, 1.0). From completed assessments, 1653 (74%) reported at least one toxicity in open-text comments; fatigue (n\\xa0=\\xa0182), stomach discomfort (n\\xa0=\\xa053), and skin/nail changes (n\\xa0=\\xa041) were most frequently reported. Regarding consequences, 156 patients (7%) reported unplanned health care service use: 41 (26%) visited an emergency department and 32 (21%) were admitted to a hospital.\\nQuerying patients on chemotherapy treatment experiences and toxicities was feasible. Toxicity rates varied across practices, which informed quality improvement. Toxicity severity and service use incidence exceed previously published trial data, particularly for pain, fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues. Open-text questions enabled exploration with newer treatment regimens. Recently, increasing studies suggested that lncRNA SNHG12 was aberrantly expressed in kinds of cancers. However, definite prognostic value of SNHG12 remains unclear. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between SNHG12 expression level and cancer prognosis. A literature retrieval was conducted by searching kinds of databases. The meta-analysis was performed by using Revman 5.2 and Stata 12.0 software. Besides, The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was analyzed to validate the results in our meta-analysis via using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. The pooled results showed that high SNHG12 expression significantly indicated worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Tumor type, sample size, survival analysis method, and cutoff value did not alter SNHG12 prognosis value according to stratified analysis results. Additionally, higher expression of SNHG12 suggested unfavorable clinicopathological outcomes including larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced clinical stage. Online cross-validation in TCGA dataset further indicated that cancer patients with upregulated SNHG12 expression had worse overall survival and disease-free survival. Therefore, elevated SNHG12 expression was associated with poor survival and unfavorable clinical outcomes in various cancers, and therefore might be a potential prognostic biomarker in human cancers.  LncRNA is a kind of non-coding RNA and its research is more popular in recent years, which has more than 200 nucleotides. It plays a significant part in a variety of biological functions, including chromosome modification, genome modification, transcriptional activation, transcriptional interference, and other processes. FTX, at the center of the X chromosome inactivation, it was showed that lncRNA FTX regulates cancer cells\\' development, migration and invasion in many studies.\\nRelevant literatures were collected through PubMed system search and summarized.\\nLncRNA FTX abnormally increased in tumor cells, such as liver cancer, stomach cancer, leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, glioma, osteosarcoma, etc. However, the expression level decreased in temporal lobe epilepsy, liver cirrhosis, heart failure, etc. Conclusion: FTX may be an important regulatory factor and a potential therapeutic target in cancers. The bursa sac and greater omentum were considered as the dorsal mesogastrium more than 100 years. Bursectomy and omentectomy has been used as an essential part of radical gastrectomy with extended lymphadenectomy. However, structure of the bursa sac and omentum were difficult to be consistent with the definition and deduction of the mesentery. Also, it was hard to be proved that bursectomy and omentectomy could get oncological benefit from clinical randomized control trials recent years. We proposed a model of the proximal segment of dorsal mesogastrium (PSDM) here to compared with bursa model. It was demonstrated that the PSDM was consisted by the right gastric mesentery, right gastroepiploic mesentery, left gastric mesentery, left gastroepiploic mesentery, posterior gastric mesentery, and short gastric mesentery. The complete PSDM excision have been proved efficient in decreasing bleeding during operation and preventing cancer leak from PSDM during lymphadenectomy, as well as limiting the surgical hazard and developing oncological benefit. So that, PSDM model was presented as an alternative model for surgeons to practice and prove, even more evidences are still on the way.\\n100余年来，学者们一直认为网膜囊、大网膜就是胃背侧系膜，其完整切除是根治性胃癌切除术的基本组成部分。但是，网膜囊、大网膜在结构上不符合系膜的定义，临床随机对照研究结果也未能证明网膜囊切除、大网膜切除可以改善胃癌患者的预后。近年来我们提出胃背侧系膜近侧段模型，由胃右系膜、胃网膜右系膜、胃左系膜、胃网膜左系膜、胃后系膜和胃短系膜构成。胃背侧系膜近侧段的完整切除可以减少胃癌根治术中出血和淋巴结清扫中的癌泄露，从而同步改善胃癌手术的外科学效果和肿瘤学获益。胃背侧系膜近侧段模型为精准实施胃癌外科治疗提供了一个新的思路。. Nivolumab is effective for gastric cancer and lung cancer, but complete response is rare. We experienced a case of synchronous gastric cancer and lung cancer who was treated by nivolumab and laparoscopic gastrectomy.\\nA 63-year-old male consulted our institution and was found to have gastric cancer cT1(SM)N0M0 Stage IA and lung cancer cT2N2M1(PUL) Stage IV. He received eight chemotherapy treatments plus radiation, but the lung disease remained progressive. Finally, he received nivolumab therapy and complete response of both cancers was obtained. The gastric cancer recurred, but was successfully treated by laparoscopic gastrectomy. The resected specimen revealed three lesions, each being pT1aN0M0 Stage IA. The primary gastric cancer seemed to have completely vanished without scarring.\\nThis was thought to be a rare case of gastric cancer recurrence after complete response of gastric cancer and lung cancer to nivolumab. To analyze the correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter of \\nThe expression of \\nAnalysis of the data from Cancer RNA-Seq Nexus and the results of RT-qPCR in 3 gastric cancer patients all showed significantly increased \\nThe expression of  The predictive value of inflammatory parameters as indicators of poor overall survival (OS) has been well studied in various tumors. This study aimed to explore the association of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), among other parameters in upper gastro-intestinal tract tumors with distant metastases and OS.\\nRetrospective analysis was done for 945 patients (males n= 539, 57.0%) with a median of 57 years (range 19-90 years) treated at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) for gastric (n=501), pancreatic (n=355), and biliary (n=89) carcinoma. NLR, and other parameters were calculated at primary presentation, and the association between the parameters with baseline distant metastases and OS was studied. The optimal cutoff value of NLR was based on receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. A prognostic nomogram was then constructed to explore how accurately the OS can be predicted.\\nPatients with high baseline NLR (>3.2) had more distant metastases on presentation than patients with low NLR (≤3.2), (p-value <0.001). Age older than 57 years was associated with poor median OS (8.7 versus 10.6 months, p-value=\\xa00.04). In addition, the location of the tumor as stomach versus biliary tract (Odds Ratio 0.443 95% CI 0.281-0.699), and pancreas versus biliary tract (Odds Ratio 1.193, 95% CI 0.749-1.902, p-value <0.001) proved to be significant. In multivariate analysis, age older than 57 years (p-value =0.0033, HR 0.792, 95% CI 0.678-0.925), location of the tumor (p-value <0.0001), presence of distant metastasis (p-value <0.0001, HR 2.063, 95% CI 1.760-2.419), and NLR (p-value <0.0001, HR 1.045, 95% CI 1.028-1.062) remained significant. Nomogram confirmed the significance of NLR as an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.31-2.01, p-value <0.0001).\\nOur results suggested that high baseline inflammatory markers are associated with distant metastases and poor OS. The utilization of this association in management of cancer patients still warrants further investigation. Cisplatin is an antineoplastic drug known to produce intense vomiting, gastric dysmotility, and peripheral neuropathy. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer with prokinetic properties potentially useful for cancer patients under chemotherapy. Our aim was to test whether MSG may improve gastrointestinal motor dysfunction and other adverse effects induced by repeated cisplatin in rats.\\nMale Wistar rats were exposed or not to MSG (4\\xa0g\\xa0L\\nMonosodium glutamate prevented the development of cisplatin-induced neuropathy and partially improved intestinal transit after the fifth cisplatin administration with little impact on gastric dysmotility. MSG did not improve the histological damage of gut wall, but prevented the changes induced by cisplatin in the colonic myenteric plexus.\\nOur results suggest that MSG can improve some dysfunctions caused by anticancer chemotherapy in the gut and other systems, associated, at least partially, with neuroprotectant effects. The potentially useful adjuvant role of this food additive to reduce chemotherapy-induced sequelae warrants further evaluation. Studies on the prognostic significance of site-specific distant metastasis, multiple-site metastases, and the impact of surgery of the primary tumor and metastatic lesion on survival outcomes of patients with metastatic gastric cancer (GC) remain elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of the site of distant metastasis among patients with metastatic GC. Furthermore, the effect of surgery of the primary tumor and metastatic lesion on the prognosis of metastatic GC was also analyzed.\\nThe data of 4,221 eligible patients, who were diagnosed with metastatic GC between 2010 and 2015, were identified from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between potential prognostic factors, including the site of metastasis and surgery, and survival of patients with metastatic GC. Overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) were determined using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and differences were assessed using the Log-rank test.\\nOut of the total 4,221 GC patients with definite organ metastases, 3312 patients had single-site metastasis while 909 patients had multiple-site metastases. GC patients with single-site metastasis of liver or lung exhibited better CSS and OS compared to those with bone metastasis. Furthermore, GC patients with liver metastasis benefited from surgery of both the primary and metastatic lesions, while those with lung metastasis benefited from surgery of metastasis resection only. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that GC patients with single-site metastasis, well-differentiated tumors, GC patients who underwent surgery of the primary tumor and those who received chemotherapy exhibited favorable prognosis.\\nThe site of metastasis was an independent prognostic factor for metastatic GC. Surgery had survival benefits in certain cases of metastatic GC; however, further studies are warranted to clarify these benefits in carefully selected patients. Intracorporeal Billroth I (B-I) reconstruction using an endoscopic linear stapler (ELS) is widely performed in total laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. However, conventional procedures require many ELSs for anastomosis. Here, we introduce the novel intracorporeal semi-hand-sewn (SHS) B-I reconstruction.\\nAfter the transection of stomach and duodenum using ELS following adequate lymph node dissection, small entry holes were made on the anterior wall in the greater curvature of the stomach and the duodenal stump. The posterior walls of both the remnant stomach and the duodenum were attached with the ELS and fired to create the posterior wall of the B-I anastomosis. All the transection line of the duodenum and one-third of the transection line of the stomach were dissected; finally the anterior wall suturing at the anastomotic site was performed by the laparoscopic hand-sewn technique.\\nSHS procedure was performed for 17 gastric cancer patients. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. One intra-abdominal abscess was observed although there was no anastomotic leakage. The median reconstruction time was 48\\u2009minutes (32-63). The SHS procedure was safe, feasible, and economical, although it requires sufficient laparoscopic suturing and ligation skill. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in cancer metastasis and relapse. Therefore, identification of CSC biomarkers might help determine the success of a treatment. In this study, we examined the expression of four CSC markers: Cluster of differentiation 44 variant (CD44v), leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), frizzled 7 (FZD7), and muscle, intestine and stomach expression 1 (MIST1), in cancer tissues of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer at >5 years after resection, and its clinical significance.\\nWe examined the expression of each CSC marker in 360 patients with NSCLC (n=360) who underwent curative resection by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays, and determined its relationship with survival.\\nHigh expression of MIST1 was related to better overall survival (p<0.05); high CD44v expression was associated with poor overall and recurrence-free survival (p<0.001 for both) and thus, CD44v was defined as an independent prognostic factor (p<0.05), according to a multivariate analysis.\\nTumoral CD44v expression might be a useful prognostic marker for patients after curative resection of NSCLC. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection affects a substantial proportion of the world population and is a major risk factor of gastric cancer (GC). The caveats of common Hp-tests can be evaded by a serological biomarker test (GastroPanel®, Biohit Oyj, Helsinki), the most comprehensive Hp-test on the market. The clinical validation of Helicobacter pylori IgG ELISA of the new-generation GastroPanel® test is reported. The aim of the study is to validate the clinical performance of the Helicobacter pylori IgG ELISA test in diagnosis of biopsy-confirmed Hp-infection in gastroscopy referral patients.\\nA cohort of 101 patients (mean age=50.1 years) referred for gastroscopy at the outpatient Department of Gastroenterology (SM Clinic, St. Petersburg) were examined by two test versions to validate the new-generation GastroPanel®. All patients were examined by gastroscopy and biopsies, which were stained with Giemsa for specific identification of Hp in the antrum (A) and corpus (C).\\nBiopsy-confirmed Hp-infection was found in 64% of patients, most often confined to antrum. The overall agreement between Hp IgG ELISA and gastric biopsies in Hp-detection was 91% (95%CI=84.1-95.8%). Hp IgG ELISA diagnosed biopsy-confirmed Hp (A&C) with sensitivity (SE) of 92.3%, specificity (SP) of 88.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.8% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 86.1%, with AUC=0.904 (95%CI=0.842-0.967). In ROC analysis for Hp detection (A&C), Hp IgG ELISA shows AUC=0.978 (95%CI=0.956-1.000).\\nThe Hp IgG ELISA test successfully concludes the clinical validation process of the new-generation GastroPanel® test, which retains the unrivalled diagnostic performance of all its four biomarkers, extensively documented for the first-generation test in different clinical settings. Asian Americans (AA) are one of the largest and fastest growing minority groups in the United States consisting of 18 million people. This population is an ethnically diverse group that tends to be classified as one cohort resulting in hidden survival disparities among AA subgroups.\\nThe National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients of Korean, Japanese or Filipino ancestry with gastric adenocarcinoma or esophageal adenocarcinoma between 2004 and 2013.\\nA total of 28,213 patients met the inclusion criteria: 1,542 with gastric adenocarcinoma and 26,671 with esophageal adenocarcinoma. The Korean group with gastric cancer (0.42) showed improved 5-year survival over the Japanese (0.31) and Filipino (0.21; p<0.001) groups.\\nA significant difference in survival exists among AA subgroups signifying a need to acknowledge the heterogeneity of AA in future studies. Thus, individual-specific medicine with respect to race-related outcomes is extremely important. Lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha factor (LITAF) has been identified as a tumor suppressor in human cancers. Present study, we assessed biological role of LITAF in human gastric cancer.\\nThe clinical impacts of LITAF expression were assessed in gastric cancer using public databases. The biological role of LITAF was assessed in gastric cancer cells using siLITAF transfection.\\nHigh LITAF expression was correlated well with worse prognosis, including pathological stage (p=0.034) and pathological T stage (p=0.047), as well as with shorter survival. Herein, we present a novel finding that miR-1-3p could inhibit LITAF expression by directly binding to the 3\\'-untranslated region of LITAF mRNA. Cell functional assays revealed that LITAF knockdown could significantly suppress gastric cancer growth and motility.\\nHigh LITAF expression resulting from low miR-1-3p expression is a biomarker for poor prognosis or therapeutic targets in gastric cancer. Metastasis to the ovary from nongynecologic organs accounts for 9% of all ovarian malignancies. Although the most common nongynecologic primary site of ovarian metastasis is the gastrointestinal tract, metastasis from other sites to the ovary is not uncommon. Differential diagnosis of primary and metastatic ovarian tumors is important; otherwise, appropriate treatment cannot be determined. Furthermore, an optimal treatment strategy for ovarian metastasis from nongynecologic primary sites still needs to be explored.\\nOne hundred seventy-seven patients with ovarian metastasis from nongynecologic primary sites admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital between May 2005 and May 2018 were retrospectively evaluated.\\nThe mean age was 48\\u2009years (range, 18-83). Approximately 60% of patients were premenopausal women. The two most common nongynecologic primary sites of ovarian metastasis were the colorectum (68 cases) and stomach (61 cases). In addition to the most common symptoms of abdominal distension (39.0%), abdominal pain (37.9%), and ascites (27.7%), 18.1% of patients presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. Half of the patients who tested serum CA-125 preoperatively had elevated CA-125 levels within the range of 35\\u2009U/ml to 200\\u2009U/ml. More than 70% of synchronous ovarian metastases were preoperatively misdiagnosed as primary ovarian cancer. Of all included cases, 56.5% achieved optimal cytoreductive surgery (the diameter of the largest residual lesion <\\u20092\\u2009cm). The overall 5-year survival rate and median survival time were 10% and 20\\u2009months, respectively. The primary site, optimal cytoreductive surgery, tumor differentiation, and postoperative adjuvant treatment were identified as prognostic indicators.\\nThe colorectum and stomach are the most common nongynecologic primary sites of ovarian metastasis. Synchronous ovarian metastasis is easily misdiagnosed as primary ovarian cancer. Optimal cytoreductive surgery and postoperative adjuvant treatment can be performed to confer survival benefit in selected patients. In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged and affected health care worldwide. Patients with cancer and other comorbidities are at increased risk for adverse outcomes in this infection.\\nIn this case report we present a 75-year-old patient with a localized gastric adenocarcinoma, currently treated by perioperative chemotherapy regimen, who had an rT-PCR proven novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory and radiologic assessments were performed in order to assess disease severity; however, the findings were not altered in accordance with the findings associated with COVID-19 disease.\\nOn the first hospital day the patient had a low grade fever with chills. Subsequently a pharmacological therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was started. After pharmacologic and symptomatic treatment, the patient was reassessed for SARS-CoV-2, with negative results. At discharge, the patient was ordered a 14-day mandatory quarantine. After 57 days of follow-up, the patient underwent a new rapid antibody test by Acro Biotech inc., which gave negative results for IgM and IgG.\\nAn infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a more severe disease in patients with comorbidities and cancer; however, this case patient had a mild course of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this case report is to share the information on the clinical course and outcomes of a patient with malignancy. Rapid spreading of information is crucial in the management of COVID-19. The mechanisms of Wnt/β-catenin pathway signaling and abnormal expression of tumor suppressor genes is not well known in gastric cancer (GC). Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has recently been identified as a possible link therein. In this study, we investigated the role of lung cancer associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1) in GC.\\nThe expression of LUCAT1 in GC cell lines and 100 tissue samples was examined by qRT-PCR. Two different siRNAs were used for knockdown of LUCAT1 expression. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. To analyze metastasis, scratch wound-healing assay, a Matrigel invasion assay, and colony formation assay were performed. Apoptosis was analyzed by PI/Annexin-V staining. To check the methylation status in tumor suppressor genes, methylation-specific PCR was carried out. Western blot was performed to detect epithelial-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis markers upon silencing of LUCAT1 (siLUCAT1).\\nLUCAT1 expression in GC cell lines and tissues was significantly elevated, compared to that in normal gastric cells and adjacent non-tumor tissues (\\nWe concluded that LUCAT1 induces methylation of  Clinical studies have produced conflicting results on the effects of metformin on gastrointestinal cancer development. We aimed to investigate the association between metformin use and stomach, colon, liver, and pancreatic cancer development among patients with newly diagnosed, drug-naïve type 2 diabetes.\\nThis retrospective study evaluated propensity score-matched patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Metformin users were categorized into tertiles according to the cumulative dose or duration of metformin treatment, and the risks of gastrointestinal cancers were compared.\\nMetformin users had reduced risks of developing stomach cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.841, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.797-0.887), colon cancer (HR: 0.865, 95% CI: 0.822-0.91), and liver cancer (HR: 0.709, 95% CI: 0.675-0.746; P < 0.001). However, metformin users did not have a reduced overall risk of pancreatic cancer (HR: 1.335, 95% CI: 1.209-1.475; P < 0.001). The risks tended to decrease at higher cumulative doses and durations of metformin use, with significantly reduced risks of all 4 cancers at the highest cumulative dose (≥1,200,000 mg) and the longest duration (≥2,000 days) of metformin use.\\nThis population-based data suggest that metformin could be associated with reductions in the risks of stomach, colon, and liver cancers, as well a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer in some subgroups. Metformin has benefit as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. A further role in cancer risk reduction could be studied in controlled trials. Breath analysis has emerged as an experimental method of non-invasive screening of gastric cancer and identification of individuals suitable for confirmatory, diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of breath analysis for gastric cancer detection in adults.\\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CENTRAL, and Compendex up to 27 September 2020 for original studies analysing exhaled breath to detect gastric cancer in patients. Summary sensitivity and specificity analyses were obtained using a hierarchical bivariate method. Non-quantitative results were descriptively summarized. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. This study protocol was pre-registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020139422).\\nTwenty-four studies were included. Within these, breath analysis technologies most commonly used were mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods; other methods included volatile organic compound sensors and silicon nanowire field effect transistors. Fourteen studies (total n=3028) involving all technologies reported quantitative results, with sensitivities ranging from 67-100% and specificities from 71-98%. The summary sensitivity across six studies utilizing MS-based breath analysis methods was 82.4% (95% CI: 78-86%); summary specificity was 91.3% (95% CI: 83-96%). Based on these values, we estimated that screening with MS-based breath tests could lower the number needed to screen (NNS) by more than eight-fold in the 15 countries with the highest prevalence of gastric cancer.\\nBreath analysis is a promising method for gastric cancer detection with good diagnostic performance and potential to decrease the NNS for endoscopy-based gastric cancer detection. However, due to the heterogeneity of breath analysis technologies, rigorous studies with standardized, reproducible methods are needed to evaluate the clinical applicability of these technologies. Morbidity and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is age-dependent. It remains unclear whether vertical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurs during pregnancy and how such infection will affect fetal development. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of placenta and other tissues from fetuses in comparison with those from adults using public-available datasets. Our analysis revealed that a very small proportion of trophoblast cells expressed the  The prognostic potential of anti-tumor immune responses is becoming increasingly important in adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction and stomach (AGE/S) especially regarding the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study analyzes for the first time the prognostic impact of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and checkpoint inhibitors in a large Caucasian cohort in patients with AGE/S. We screened tissue samples from 438 therapy-naïve patients with AGE/S undergoing surgery between 1992 and 2005, examined in a tissue microarray (TMA) and stained against human CD3, CD4, CD8, PD-1, and PD-L1. Out of 438 tissue samples, 210 were eligible for multivariate analysis. This revealed that high infiltration with CD3 Cancer prevalence (people alive on a certain date in a population who previously had a cancer diagnosis) is expected to increase in the United States and Europe due to improvements in survival and population aging. Examination of prevalence by phase of care allows us to identify subgroups of patients according to their care trajectories, thus allowing us to improve health care planning, resource allocation, and calculation of costs.\\nA new method to estimate prevalence by phase of care using grouped data is illustrated. Prevalence is divided into 3 mutually exclusive phases: initial, continuing, and end-of-life. An application to US and Italian data is applied to prevalent cases diagnosed with colon-rectum, stomach, lung, or breast cancer.\\nThe distribution of phase of care prevalence estimated by cancer type and sex and results from the two datasets are very similar. Most survivors are in the continuing phase; the end-of-life phase is larger for cancers with worse prognosis. All phases prevalence is generally higher in the Italian than in the US dataset, except for lung cancer in women, where prevalence proportion in the Italian dataset is 30% lower than in the United States.\\nIncidence, survival, and population age structure are the main determinants of prevalence and they can affect differences in all phases of prevalence, as well as in discrete phases. Incidence is the most influential determinant. Ours is the first study that compares prevalence by phase of care between two populations in Italy and the United States. Despite great differences in health care management in the two countries, we found extremely similar distribution of survivors by phase of care for most cancer sites under study. We report a case of a 67-years-old woman presenting a severe acute lymphocytic gastritis induced by pembrolizumab, an immune check point inhibitor (ICI). This gastritis was her third auto-immune adverse event after 5 years of treatment with pembrolizumab, it was metabolically active at the PET Scan and confirmed by analysis of the gastric biopsies. Pembrolizumab treatment cessation and high doses of corticosteroids completely normalized the stomach clinically, endoscopically and histologically. This patient was in complete remission of her metastatic melanoma. Therefore, pembrolizumab therapy was not restarted and the patient is still in remission 6 months later. This strategy is supported by recent publications describing a relapse rate inferior to 10% in patients in complete remission after 2 years of immunotherapy. Particularities of this case are: rareness of this adverse event, late onset after introduction of pembrolizumab, evocative PET scan image, specific endoscopic aspect and histology. In addition, the favorable oncologic evolution of the patient after treatment cessation confirms the prolonged remission after immunotherapy. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis by inducing precancerous changes such as atrophic gastritis (AG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM). In our study, we aim to compare the grade of AG and IM before and after Hp eradication in patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in our center.\\nThe data of 40.060 patients who underwent EGD for various reasons in our Endoscopy Unit between June 2011 and November 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. The grade of AG and IM before and after Hp eradication of patients meeting the study criteria were compared with each other. In addition, these findings were compared using OLGA and OLGIM staging systems.\\nA total of 175 patients, 89 (50.9%) women and 86 (49.1%) men, were included in the study. The mean age was 55±12 years. The mean time between two EGD examinations was 38±14 months. Significant improvement was observed in the grade of AG on corpus and antrum after Hp eradication (P=0.000, P=0.008). In the corpus and antrum, the grade of IM was regressed but this was not significant (P=0.80 and P=0.370 respectively). There was a decrease in OLGA stages after Hp eradication (P=0.000). There was also a reduction in the OLGIM stages, but this was not significant(P=0.341).\\nOur study demonstrates that Hp eradication may reduce the risk of developing GC by providing an improvement in AG and IM which are precancerous changes in GC. Sleep disorders have emerged as potential cancer risk factors.\\nThis review discusses the relationships between sleep, obesity, and breathing disorders with concomitant risks of developing cancer.\\nSleep disorders result in abnormal expression of clock genes, decreased immunity, and melatonin release disruption. Therefore, these disorders may contribute to cancer development. Moreover, in sleep breathing disorder, which is frequently experienced by obese persons, the sufferer experiences intermittent hypoxia that may stimulate cancer cell proliferation.\\nDuring short- or long- duration sleep, sleep-wake rhythm disruption may occur. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea increase cancer risks. In short sleepers, an increased risk of stomach cancer, esophageal squamous cell cancer, and breast cancer was observed. Among long sleepers (>9 hours), the risk of some hematologic malignancies is elevated.\\nSeveral factors including insomnia, circadian disruption, obesity, and intermittent hypoxia in obstructive sleep apnea are contributing risk factors for increased risk of several types of cancers. However, further studies are needed to determine the more significant of these risk factors and their interactions. Currently, only a few available targeted drugs are considered to be effective in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) treatment. The PARP inhibitor olaparib is a molecularly targeted drug that continues to be investigated in BRCA-mutated tumors. However, in tumors without BRCA gene mutations, particularly in STAD, the effect and molecular mechanism of olaparib are unclear, which largely restricts the use of olaparib in STAD treatment. In this study, the in vitro results showed that olaparib specifically inhibited cell growth and migration, exerting antitumor effect in STAD cell lines. In addition, a ClC-3/SGK1 regulatory axis was identified and validated in STAD cells. We then found that the down-regulation of ClC-3/SGK1 axis attenuated olaparib-induced cell growth and migration inhibition. On the contrary, the up-regulation of ClC-3/SGK1 axis enhanced olaparib-induced cell growth and migration inhibition, and the enhancement effect could be attenuated by SGK1 knockdown. Consistently, the whole-cell recorded chloride current activated by olaparib presented the same variation trend. Next, the clinical data showed that ClC-3 and SGK1 were highly expressed in human STAD tissues and positively correlated (r\\u2009=\\u20090.276, P\\u2009=\\u20090.009). Furthermore, high protein expression of both ClC-3 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.030) and SGK1 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006) was associated with poor survival rate in STAD patients, and positive correlations between ClC-3/SGK1 and their downstream molecules in STAD tissues were demonstrated via the GEPIA datasets. Finally, our results suggested that olaparib inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in STAD cells, and up-regulation of ClC-3/SGK1 axis enhanced olaparib-induced PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition. The animal experiments indicated that olaparib also exerted antitumor effect in vivo. Altogether, our findings illustrate that olaparib exerts antitumor effect in human STAD, and ClC-3/SGK1 regulatory axis enhances the olaparib-induced antitumor effect. Up-regulation of the ClC-3/SGK1 axis may provide promising therapeutic potential for the clinical application of olaparib in STAD treatment. To explore the predictive value of thromboelastography (TEG) for the occurrence of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (LDVT) in gastric cancer combined with portal hypertension patients after operation.\\n172 gastric cancer patients combined with portal hypertension were randomly divided into laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy groups. All patients were taken venous blood on an empty stomach 1 day before operation, 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days after operation.\\nThere was no significant difference in R value, K value, α angle, and MA before and after operation (\\nThe combination of R value, K value, α angle, and MA at 3 days after surgery has a moderately effective predictive effect for the occurrence of LDVT in gastric cancer patients combined with portal hypertension. Phenolic compounds may exert a favorable effect on the risk of several cancer types, including gastric cancer (GC). However, selected polyphenol classes have not been adequately investigated in relation to GC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the intake of polyphenols in relation to GC risk. We used data from the Stomach cancer Pooling (StoP) Project, including 10 studies from six countries (3471 GC cases and 8344 controls). We carried out an individual participant data pooled analysis using a two-stage approach. The summary odds ratios (ORs) of GC for each compound, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), were computed by pooling study specific ORs obtained through multivariate logistic regression, using random effect models. Inverse associations with GC emerged for total polyphenols (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.54-0.81, for the highest versus lowest quartile of intake), total flavonoids (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.90), anthocyanidins (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56-0.92), flavanols (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.66-0.88), flavanones (OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.44-0.69), total phenolic acids (OR = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.55-0.94), and hydroxybenzoic acids (OR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.57-0.89). Results were consistent across strata of age, sex, social class, and smoking habit. Suggestive inverse associations were also found for flavonols (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.51-1.01) and hydroxycinnamic acids (OR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.58-1.06). Further investigations from longitudinal data are needed to confirm this association. The Korean National Cancer Screening Survey (KNCSS) is a nationwide annual cross-sectional survey conducted for the past 15 years. This study aimed to report trends in the overall screening rates of both organized and opportunistic cancer screening programs from 2004-2018.\\nKNCSS data were collected using a structured questionnaire. For five major cancers (i.e., stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer), we evaluated both the lifetime screening rate and the screening rate with recommendations. The study population included men aged 40-74 years and women aged 20-74 years with no cancer histories.\\nScreening rate with recommendations increased from 2004 annually by 4.4% and 1.5% until 2013 for stomach and liver cancers, respectively, by 4.0% until 2012 for breast cancer, and by 3.6% and 1.2% until 2014 for colorectal and cervical cancers, respectively, followed by nonsignificant trends thereafter. In 2018, screening rates with recommendations for these cancers were 72.8, 26.2, 63.1, 58.4, and 55.6%, respectively.\\nScreening rates for the five types of cancer demonstrated a marked increase between 2004 and 2018. However, many recent screening rates have been flattened with nonsignificant trends, and there are lower rates for cervical cancer screening among young age groups. Steady efforts are needed to achieve higher screening participation rates overall, especially for the cervical cancer screening of young women in their 20s. The incidence of proximal gastric adenocarcinoma is increasing among younger adults. Rodent models have shown that hypergastrinemia causes carcinogenesis in the proximal stomach. The aim of our study was therefore to assess if hypergastrinemia was associated with an increased risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma also in humans. A prospective population-based nested case-control study within the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) cohort, Norway, was used to assess this association. Serum was collected from 78\\u2009962 participants in 1995 to 1997 and 2006 to 2008. In the cohort, 181 incident gastric adenocarcinoma cases were identified from the Norwegian Cancer and Patient Registries through 2015 and matched with 359 controls. The risk of gastric adenocarcinoma was compared between participants with prediagnostic hypergastrinemia (>60\\u2009pmol/L) and normal serum gastrin (≤60\\u2009pmol/L). Logistic regression provided odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for body mass index, tobacco smoking and comorbidity. Hypergastrinemia was associated with increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma overall (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.4) and in particular for gastric adenocarcinoma with proximal location (OR 6.1, 95% CI 2.7-13.8), but not with gastric adenocarcinoma with distal location (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-3.4). Moreover, hypergastrinemia was associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma of intestinal histological type (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.8-7.9), but not for diffuse histological type (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7-3.7). In conclusion, hypergastrinemia was associated with an increased risk of proximal and intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma. We hypothesized that the Endoscopic Surgical Skill Qualification System (ESSQS) can shorten operative time, resulting in a decrease in postoperative morbidity. Here, we aimed to clarify whether ESSQS-qualified surgeons could decrease the incidence of complications.\\nBetween January 2009 and June 2019, 1042 patients diagnosed with both clinical and pathological Stage\\u2009≤\\u2009III gastric cancer and undergoing LG were enrolled. In all LG procedures involving ESSQS-qualified surgeons, these served as the operator or the instructive assistant. The short-term outcomes were retrospectively compared between the ESSQS-qualified and the non-ESSQS-qualified surgeons using a propensity-score matched analysis.\\nAfter propensity-score matching, 321 patients were included in each group. No significant differences were observed in morbidity rate, and length of hospitalization following surgery, although the non-ESSQS-qualified surgeon group had a significantly longer total operative time (Non-ESSQS-qualified group, 368 [170-779] min vs. ESSQS-qualified group, 316 [147-772] min; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and larger estimated blood loss (Non-ESSQS-qualified group, 28 [0-702] mL vs. ESSQS-qualified group 25, [0-1069] mL; p\\u2009=\\u20090.042). Multivariate analysis revealed that operative time\\u2009≥\\u2009360\\xa0min (OR 1.818 [1.069-3.094], p\\u2009=\\u20090.027) was identified as the only significant independent risk factor determining morbidity.\\nThe incidence of postoperative morbidity did not differ between patients operated by the qualified and nonqualified surgeons, as long as ESSQS-qualified surgeons provide intraoperative instructions. Red cell distribution width (RDW) has predictive properties in different benign and malignant diseases.\\nOur aim was to evaluate the predictive value of RDW for malignant gastric lesions by upper gastrointestinal screening.\\nData of 91 male patients (Group A) who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and subsequent surgery for gastric malignancy and age-matched 91 healthy male patients (Group B) with benign disorders were reviewed in this retrospective cohort study. The pathology reports, laboratory parameters, and demographics of the patients were recorded for comparison. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted for RDW, and a threshold for prediction of malignancy was calculated.\\nThe average age of the patients with gastric cancer was 62 (interquartile range [IQR]: 53-70) years. The difference in RDW levels between Group A and Group B was found to be significant: 14.40% (IQR: 13.40-16.40) versus 13.10% (IQR: 12.55-13.50) for the malignant and benign groups, respectively, \\nRDW was found to have a PPV for malignancy in nearly two-thirds of the patients and had a similar NPV.  Intraabdominal schwannomas are rare benign tumors. In this study, we aimed to present our clinical experience in patients with intrabdominally located Schwannoma.\\nPatients who received the diagnosis of intrabdominal schwannoma between 2011-2019 were retrospectively examined. Demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment methods, short- and long-term results and immunohistochemical characteristics of the patients were analyzed.\\nA total of 7 patients were included in the study. Four patients were female and three were male. The mean age was 51.5 (31-63) years. The most common clinical presentation was abdominal pain (57.1%). Tumor location was stomach (n=2), pelvic region (n=2), rectum (n=1), retropancreas (n=1), and left juxtadrenal space (n=1). Postoperative wound infection developed in one patient and pancreatic fistula complication was seen in one patient. Re-admissions to the hospital were due to anemia and pleural effusion in two patients. The mean tumor diameter was 6 cm (0.3-13 cm). All patients were S 100 strongly positive Mitoses / 50 HPFs (high power field), <2 Ki67 <3%. The mean follow- up period was 60 months. Currently, 5 patients are being followed without disease, 1 patient survives despite recurrence and 1 patient has died due to non-cancer reasons.\\nIntrabdominal schwannomas are rare tumors which most commonly exhibit gastrointestinal involvement. Since these tumors are mostly benign, the long-term prognosis of patients is good. Schwannoma should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of intrabdominal masses. Radical resections with high morbidity and mortality should be avoided if preoperative diagnosis is made.\\nAbdominal tumor, Mesenchymal tumor, Nerve sheath tumor, Schwannoma.\\nGli schwannomi intraaddominali sono tumori benigni rari. In questo studio, intendiamo presentare la nostra esperienza clinica di pazienti con Schwannoma intraaddominale localizzato. Sono stati esaminati retrospettivamente i pazienti in cui è stato diagnosticato uno schwannoma intra-addominale tra il 2011-2019, analizzando le caratteristiche demografiche e cliniche, i metodi di trattamento, i risultati a breve e lungo termine e le caratteristiche immunoistochimiche dei pazienti. Nello studio sono stati inclusi 7 pazienti: quattro donne e tre uomini. L’età media era di 51,5 (31-63) anni. La presentazione clinica più comune è stata il dolore addominale (57,1%). La posizione del tumore era stomaco (n = 2), regione pelvica (n = 2), retto (n = 1), retropancreas (n = 1) e spazio iuxtadrenale sinistro (n = 1). In un paziente si è avuta l’infezione della ferita postoperatoria, e in uno la complicazione di una fistola pancreatica. I ricoveri in ospedale erano dovuti all’anemia e al versamento pleurico in due pazienti. Il diametro medio del tumore era di 6 cm (0,3-13 cm). Tutti i pazienti erano S 100 Mitosi fortemente positive / 50 HPF (campo ad alta potenza), <2 Ki67 <3%. Il periodo medio di follow-up è stato di 60 mesi. Attualmente, 5 pazienti vengono seguiti senza malattia, 1 paziente sopravvive nonostante la recidiva e 1 paziente è deceduto per motivi non cancerosi. Conclusione: gli schwannomi intra-addominali sono tumori rari che presentano più comunemente un coinvolgimento gastrointestinale. Poiché questi tumori sono per lo più benigni, la prognosi a lungo termine dei pazienti è buona. Lo Schwannoma dovrebbe essere tenuto presente nella diagnosi differenziale delle masse intraaddominali. Le resezioni radicali con elevata morbilità e mortalità dovrebbero essere evitate se viene fatta una diagnosi preoperatoria. The protease MALT1 is a key regulator of NF-κB signaling and a novel therapeutic target in autoimmunity and cancer. Initial enthusiasm supported by preclinical results with MALT1 inhibitors was tempered by studies showing that germline MALT1 protease inactivation in mice results in reduced regulatory T\\xa0cells and lethal multi-organ inflammation due to expansion of IFN-γ-producing T\\xa0cells. However, we show that long-term MALT1 inactivation, starting in adulthood, is not associated with severe systemic inflammation, despite reduced regulatory T\\xa0cells. In contrast, IL-2-, TNF-, and IFN-γ-producing CD4 Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is one of the most common malignant tumors. The Janus kinases (JAKs) play a significant part in cellular biological process, inflammation, and immunity. The roles of JAKs in STAD are still not systematically described.\\nA series of bioinformatics tools were used to clarify the role of JAKs in STAD.\\nJAK3/TYK2 levels were significantly increased in STAD during subgroup analyses based on gender, tumor grade, cancer stages, and nodal metastasis status. STAD patients with high levels of JAK3/TYK2 had poor overall survival, postprogression survival, and first progression. Immune infiltration revealed a significant correlation between JAK3/TYK2 expression and the abundance of immune cells as well as immune biomarker expression in STAD. JAK3/TYK2 was associated with the adaptive immune response, chemokine signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway.\\nJAK3 and TYK2 serve as prognostic biomarkers and are associated with immune infiltration in STAD. Localized primary gastric amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillary protein in the stomach and can mimic various diseases on endoscopic examination, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, gastric cancer and ulcers.\\nHere, we report a series of three cases of localized gastric amyloidosis mimicking gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma on endoscopic examination that were evaluated over the past ten years in our hospital. The different detection times of this rare disease resulted in three completely different outcomes, indicating the strong importance of early detection, diagnosis and treatment. The difficulties encountered in making an accurate diagnosis and differential diagnosis are highlighted, and this report provides clinical experience for the diagnosis of localized primary gastric amyloidosis.\\nLocalized gastric amyloidosis is a rare metabolic disease that resembles MALT lymphoma. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of localized gastric amyloidosis result in an excellent prognosis. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is regarded as a specific indicator of epithelial malignancies and is widely used in the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, the expression of SCCA in gastric adenocarcinoma has not been studied in detail.\\nA 52-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for a 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm ulcer at the antrum-body junction with dull pain and fullness in the upper abdomen for 2 mo. His pre-surgery serological testing results showed 0.51 ng/mL SCCA (reference interval, < 1.5 ng/mL) and 9.9 ng/mL carcinoembryonic antigen (reference range, < 4.7 ng/mL). He underwent radical distal gastrectomy and Roux-en Y anastomosis and was diagnosed with poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification: Diffuse) by pathological examination of the resected lesion. Immunohistochemistry showed that SCCA was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. After surgery, the patient received an S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for six cycles containing tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium. He showed no sign of recurrence or metastasis within 24-mo follow-up.\\nThis is a frontal report of SCCA overexpression in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Ovarian metastasis is a special type of distant metastasis unique to female patients with gastric cancer. The pathogenesis of ovarian metastasis is incompletely understood, and the treatment options are controversial. Few studies have predicted the risk of ovarian metastasis. It is not clear which type of gastric cancer is more likely to metastasize to the ovary. A prediction model based on risk factors is needed to improve the rate of detection and diagnosis.\\nTo analyze risk factors of ovarian metastasis in female patients with gastric cancer and establish a nomogram to predict the probability of occurrence based on different clinicopathological features.\\nA retrospective cohort of 1696 female patients with gastric cancer between January 2006 and December 2017 were included in a single center, and patients with distant metastasis other than ovary and peritoneum metastasis were excluded. Potential risk factors for ovarian metastasis were analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Independent risk factors were chosen to construct a nomogram which received internal validation.\\nOvarian metastasis occurred in 83 of 1696 female patients. Univariate analysis showed that age, Lauren type, whether the primary lesion contained signet-ring cells, vascular tumor emboli, T stage, N stage, the expression of estrogen receptor, the expression of progesterone receptor, serum carbohydrate antigen 125 and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were risk factors for ovarian metastasis of gastric cancer (all \\nThe nomogram model performed well in the prediction of ovarian metastasis. Attention should be paid to the possibility of ovarian metastasis in high-risk populations during re-examination, to ensure early detection and treatment. The mismatch repair (MMR) system has a major role in the detection and correction of DNA replication errors, resulting from DNA polymerase slippage or nucleotides misincorporation. Specific inherited/acquired alterations or epigenetic inactivation of MMR genes are associated with microsatellite instability (MSI): the loss of crucial function in repairing DNA alterations can promote carcinogenesis by favoring the accumulation of thousands of mutations in a broad spectrum of different anatomic sites such as colon, stomach, prostate, esophagus, endometrium, lung and head and neck. Recent extensive data suggest that tumor mutational burden strongly correlates with a clinical response to immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and this response is influenced by MMR deficiency in a wide range of human solid cancers. In this context, few data about this crucial point are available for head and neck cancer (HNC). In this review, we discuss the role of MMR alterations and the resulting MSI in HNC pathogenesis. Furthermore, by summarizing the clinical available data on how they influence the progression of precancerous lesions and the risk of recurrence or second primary tumors, we want to define the current role of MSI in the management of HNC. Finally, we analyze the complex interaction between cancer cells and the immune system addressing the data now available about a potential correlation between microsatellite instability and immunotherapy response in HNC. Cancer is one of the greatest public health challenges. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 9.6 million cancer deaths have been reported in 2018. The most common cancers include lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, skin (non-melanoma) and stomach cancer. The unbalance of physiological signalling pathways due to the acquisition of mutations in tumour cells is considered the most common cancer driver. The Wingless-related integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway is crucial for tissue development and homeostasis in all animal species and its dysregulation is one of the most relevant events linked to cancer development and dissemination. The canonical and the non-canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathways are known to control both physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Herein, the impact of the Wnt/β-catenin cascade in driving cancers from different origin has been examined. Finally, based on the impact of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) on tumour growth, invasion and chemoresistance, and their role as tumour diagnostic and prognostic tools, an overview of the current knowledge linking EVs to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is also discussed. Reduced-port surgery, in which fewer ports are used than those in conventional laparoscopic surgery, is becoming increasingly popular for various procedures. However, the application of reduced-port surgery to the gastrectomy field is still underdeveloped. The aim of this study was to use meta-analysis to address the potentially important advantages of this surgical technique.\\nEmbase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically reviewed (through October 2019) to identify studies that compared reduced-port (RPLG) and conventional laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy (CLG) in patients with gastric carcinoma. The endpoints were postoperative time, length of in-hospital stay, blood loss, retrieved lymph nodes, postoperative complications, time to first flatus, and aesthetic outcome.\\nA total of 11 studies, which included 1743 patients (907 RPLG and 836 CLG), were ultimately included in this analysis. Better aesthetic results: were obtained with RPLG (risk ratio 1.578; 95%CI, 1.377-1.808; P\\u200a=\\u200a.000), although length of in-hospital stay (standard mean difference [SMD] -0.106; 95% CI, -0.222 to 0.010; P\\u200a=\\u200a.074), time to first flatus (SMD -0.006; 95%CI, -0.123 to 0.110; P\\u200a=\\u200a.913), and perioperative complications (risk ratio 0.255; 95%CI, 0.142-0.369; P\\u200a=\\u200a.478) were equivalent. However, operative time was significantly longer (SMD 0.301; 95%CI, 0.194-0.409; P\\u200a=\\u200a.00), blood loss was greater (SMD -0.31; 95%CI, -0.415 to 0.205; P\\u200a=\\u200a.000), and fewer lymph nodes were harvested (SMD 0.255; 95%CI, 0.142-0.369; P\\u200a=\\u200a.000) in the RPLG group.\\nOur meta-analysis showed that RPLG is as safe as the CLG approach and offers better aesthetic results for patients with gastric carcinoma. However, basing on current evidence, RPLG was not an efficacious surgical alternative to CLG, as operative time was significantly longer, blood loss was greater, and fewer lymph nodes were harvested in the RPLG group. Additional high-powered controlled randomized trials are required, to determine whether RPLG truly offers any advantages; these future studies should particularly focus on pain scores and aesthetic outcomes. Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is a common digestive disease. Without active treatment, it may induce gastric cancer. Western medicine has a certain effect on chronic atrophic gastritis, but there are many adverse reactions after long-term medication, and the disease is prone to relapse after treatment, which will affect the health and life of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine has obvious advantages in the treatment of chronic stomach diseases with reliable effect. A number of clinical data have also confirmed that Banxia Xiexin decoction has significant effect in the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis, but there is no evidence of evidence-based medicine. Therefore, this study aims to explore the clinical efficacy and safety of Banxia Xiexin decoction in the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis by means of systematic evaluation.\\nDatabases including PubMed, The Cochrance Library, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang were searched by computer. Besides, Baidu Scholar and Google Scholar were manually searched, and all randomized controlled trials of Banxia xiexin decoction for the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis were collected. The retrieval time was from the establishment of the database to July 31, 2020. After 2 reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the bias risk of the included study, RevMan5.3 software (developed by the UK\\'s International Cochrane Collaboration) was used to analyze the data.\\nIn this study, the effectiveness and safety of Banxia Xiexin decoction for the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis were evaluated by the clinical efficiency, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score (traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score), quality of life score, gastrin level, epidermal growth factor, eradication rate of helicobacter pylori and incidence of adverse reactions.\\nThis study will provide reliable evidence for the clinical application of Banxia Xiexin decoction in the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis.\\nThe private information from individuals will not be published. This systematic review also will not involve endangering participant rights. Ethical approval is not required. The results may be published in a peer-reviewed journal or disseminated in relevant conferences.\\nDOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/7K6QW. None Apoptosis is a type of cell death involved in different pathways inherent to the cell and the evasion from this mechanism has been related to cancer, although this process remains not very well comprehended. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most incident and aggressive types of cancer worldwide. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of INDEL variants in GC patients (Case) and individuals from the general population (Control) from the Amazon region, in which GC is remarkably frequent.\\nA panel of nine INDEL markers in apoptosis-related genes (BCL2 rs11269260, CASP3 rs4647655, CASP8 rs3834129 and rs59308963, CASP9 rs4645982 and rs61079693, FADD rs4197, FAS rs10562972 and TP53 rs17880560) was developed and genotyped by multiplex PCR in both groups.\\nIn our analyses, only marker rs4197 (FADD gene) was associated to GC development as follows: INS/DEL genotype of rs4197 increasing in about 2-fold the chances of developing this type of cancer (P\\u2009=\\u20090.046; OR\\u2009=\\u20091.940; 95%CI\\u2009=\\u20091.011-3.725).\\nOur results suggest that rs4197 (FADD gene) might play a role in gastric carcinogenesis in the investigated population. More studies are needed to clarify this relation. Here, we highlight the importance of investigating INDEL variants in genes involved in apoptosis. Linked color imaging (LCI) is a new image-enhanced endoscopy technique that allows users to recognize slight differences in mucosal color.\\nTo compare the performance of LCI with white light imaging (WLI) in detecting neoplastic lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract.\\nA controlled, multicenter trial with randomization using minimization.

The percentage of patients with 1 or more neoplastic lesions diagnosed in the first examination was higher with LCI than with WLI (60 of 750 patients or 8.0% [95% CI, 6.2% to 10.2%] vs. 36 of 752 patients or 4.8% [CI, 3.4% to 6.6%]; risk ratio, 1.67 [CI, 1.12 to 2.50; \\nEndoscopists were not blinded.\\nLCI is more effective than WLI for detecting neoplastic lesions in the pharynx, esophagus, and stomach.\\nFujifilm Corporation.  Type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors (g-NETs) have a good prognosis but a high recurrence rate.\\nTo observe the clinical efficacy of the treatment of type 1 g-NETs with the Chinese herbal decoction SMLJ01.\\nA prospective and retrospective, clinical, controlled observation was conducted in 4 Chinese centers from 2012 to 2019. Patients with type 1 g-NETs were nonrandomly divided into treatment and control groups after endoscopic treatment based on herbal treatment administered according to their wishes. The treatment group received oral SMLJ01, with follow-up every 6 to 12\\u2009months, while the control group received follow-up alone. Patient follow-up (via telephone) from 2012 to 2017 was mainly retrospective. All patients after 2017 were followed prospectively. The recurrence times and rates were compared after treatment for at least 6\\u2009months. Symptom improvements were evaluated in the treatment group. The follow-up ended on October 31, 2019.\\nDuring a median follow-up of 22\\u2009months (range: 2-86\\u2009months), the survival rate was 100%, and no metastases occurred. Twenty-one of the 82 treated patients (25.6%) had recurrence after a median of 22\\u2009months, and 22 of the 54 control patients (40.7%) had recurrence after a median of 8\\u2009months (\\nSMLJ01, with the effects of soothing the liver, strengthening the spleen, increasing acid and harmonizing the stomach, may help reduce the recurrence rate, relieve symptoms and prolong the recurrence time in patients with type 1 g-NETs and is worthy of evaluation with further randomized research with large sample sizes and longer follow-up periods. CRS/HIPEC is thought to confer a survival advantage for patients with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM). However, the impact of nonperitoneal organ resection is not clearly defined. We evaluated the impact of major organ resection (MOR) on postoperative outcomes and overall survival (OS).\\nThe US HIPEC collaborative database (2000-2017) was reviewed for MPM patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC. MOR was defined as total or partial resection of diaphragm, stomach, spleen, pancreas, small bowel, colon, rectum, kidney, ureter, bladder, and/or uterus. MOR was categorized as 0, 1, or 2+\\u2009organs.\\nA total of 174 patients were identified. Median PCI was 16 (3-39). The distribution of patients with MOR-0, MOR-1, and MOR-2+\\u2009was 94, 45, and 35 patients, respectively. MOR-1 and MOR-2+\\u2009groups had a higher frequency of any complication compared with MOR-0 (57.8%, 74.3%, and 48.9%, respectively, p\\u2009=\\u20090.035), but Clavien 3/4 complications were similar. Median length of stay was slightly higher in the MOR-1 and MOR-2+\\u2009groups (10 and 11\\xa0days) compared with the MOR-0 cohort (9\\xa0days, p\\u2009=\\u20090.005). Incomplete cytoreduction, ASA class 4, and male gender were associated with increased mortality on unadjusted analysis; however, their impact on OS was attenuated on multivariable analysis. MOR was not associated with OS based on these data (MOR-1: HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.59-4.74; MOR-2+\\u2009: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.22-2.69).\\nMOR was not associated with an increase in major complications or worse OS in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC for MPM and should be considered, if necessary, to achieve complete cytoreduction for MPM patients.  Calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) is a rare mesenchymal lesion that has been documented throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal CFTs may occur at virtually any age, with a predilection for adults and for females. They occur most commonly in the stomach and the small and large intestines. CFTs are most often found incidentally, cured by local resection, and have a low risk of recurrence. Histology shows three characteristic features: Spindle cell proliferations within a densely hyalinized stroma, scattered calcifications, and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. CFTs are immunoreactive for CD34, vimentin and factor XIIIa, helping to distinguish them from other benign mesenchymal neoplasms. The differential diagnosis of CFTs includes sclerosing gastrointestinal stromal tumor, leiomyoma, schwannoma, solitary fibrous tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, plexiform fibromyxoma, fibromatosis, sclerosing mesenteritis, and reactive nodular fibrous pseudotumor. The pathogenesis of CFTs remains unclear, but some have hypothesized that they may be linked to IgG4-related disease, inflammatory myofibroblastic lesions, hyaline vascular type Castleman disease, sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation of the spleen, or trauma. The soluble form Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (sPDL1) has immunosuppressive properties and is being studied as a candidate biomarker for immuno-oncology drug development. We measured the serum sPDL1 at pre-and post-chemotherapy and evaluated its prognostic implication and dynamics during chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (GC).\\nWe prospectively enrolled 68 GC patients who were candidates for palliative standard first-line chemotherapy, and serially collected blood at baseline and after one cycle of chemotherapy, at the best response and after disease progression. sPDL1 was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Response to chemotherapy, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and other prognostic factors including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were obtained. The cut-off value of sPDL1 levels for survival analysis was found using C-statistics.\\nThe median baseline sPDL1 was 0.8 ng/mL (range, 0.06 - 6.06 ng/mL). The median OS and PFS were 14.9 months and 8.0 months, respectively. sPDL1 and NLR showed a weak positive correlation (Spearman\\'s rho=0.301, p=0.013). Patients with low levels of sPD-L1 at diagnosis (< 1.92 ng/mL) showed a better OS and PFS than patients with a high sPDL1. The baseline sPDL1 before treatment was higher in the PD group than in the SD and PR groups. Patients whose sPDL1 increased after the first cycle of chemotherapy showed worse PFS and OS. Following disease progression, sPDL1 increased compared with the baseline.\\nsPDL1 at pre-chemotherapy confers a prognostic value for PFS and OS in GC patients under palliative first-line chemotherapy. Dynamics of sPDL1 during chemotherapy correlates with disease progression. This study aimed to evaluate the survivals of patients with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer (MRGC) over a period of 16 years and to investigate the recent changes in chemotherapy patterns.\\nA total of 5,384 patients who received chemotherapy for MRGC between 2000 and 2015 were analyzed. The analysis focused on a comparison of the first-line chemotherapy between four periods: 2000-2003 (period 1), 2004-2007 (period 2), 2008-2011 (period 3), and 2012-2015 (period 4).\\nThere were 880 patients (16%) in period 1, 1,573 (29%) in period 2, 1,435 (27%) in period 3, and 1,496 (28%) in period 4. Cytotoxic doublet-based therapy was the most commonly used (78%) first-line chemotherapy, and the combination of trastuzumab and doublet chemotherapy was provided to 288 patients. The OS rates at 12 and 24 months were steadily improved as follows: 39.2% and 14.6% in period 1, 43.5% and 17.6% in period 2, 50.3% and 20.6% in period 3, and 51.7% and 24.1% in period 4, respectively (p < 0.001). Among the patients who received the doublet-based chemotherapy, the median OS of those who received trastuzumab was 18.0 months (95% CI, 15.5-20.6), while that of those who received other doublet therapies was 11.2 months (95% CI, 10.8-11.6).\\nThe OS was improved over time with advancements in chemotherapy, particularly the introduction of the anti-HER2-targeted agent, which contributed to the increase in the number of long-term survivors and established the superiority of OS for the treatment of MRGC. Tight junctions form a barrier to the paracellular passage of luminal antigens. Although most tight junction proteins reside within the apical tight junction complex, claudin-18 localizes mainly to the basolateral membrane where its contribution to paracellular ion transport is undefined. Claudin-18 loss in mice results in gastric neoplasia development and tumorigenesis that may or may not be due to tight junction dysfunction. The aim here was to investigate paracellular permeability defects in stomach mucosa from claudin-18 knockout (Cldn18-KO) mice.\\nStomach tissue from wild-type, heterozygous, or Cldn18-KO mice were stripped of the external muscle layer and mounted in Ussing chambers. Transepithelial resistance, dextran 4 kDa flux, and potential difference (PD) were calculated from the chambered tissues after identifying differences in tissue histopathology that were used to normalize these measurements. Marker expression for claudins and ion transporters were investigated by transcriptomic and immunostaining analysis.\\nNo paracellular permeability defects were evident in stomach mucosa from Cldn18-KO mice. RNAseq identified changes in 4 claudins from Cldn18-KO mice, particularly the up-regulation of claudin-2. Although claudin-2 localized to tight junctions in cells at the base of gastric glands, its presence did not contribute overall to mucosal permeability. Stomach tissue from Cldn18-KO mice also had no PD versus a lumen-negative PD in tissues from wild-type mice. This difference resulted from changes in transcellular Cl\\nOur findings suggest that Cldn18-KO has no effect on tight junction permeability in the stomach from adult mice but rather affects anion permeability. The phenotype in these mice may thus be secondary to transcellular anion transporter expression/function in the absence of claudin-18. Constipation is a common side effect of opioid therapy. An observational study of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in Japanese patients with cancer (OIC-J) included 212 patients with various tumor types. This post hoc analysis of OIC-J evaluated a subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer.\\nPatients were aged\\u2009≥\\u200920\\xa0years, starting strong opioid therapy, had an ECOG PS of\\u2009≤\\u20092, and must have had\\u2009≥\\u20093 bowel movements during the week before enrollment. OIC was evaluated for 2\\xa0weeks after opioid initiation using the Rome IV diagnostic criteria for colorectal disorders, as well as physician\\'s diagnosis, number of spontaneous bowel movements, Bowel Function Index score, and patient\\'s self-assessment. Relationships between baseline characteristics and OIC incidence, and the effects of OIC on quality of life (QOL) were also explored.\\nFifty patients from OIC-J who had GI cancer [colon (50%), stomach (28%), and esophageal (22%)] were included. OIC incidence varied by which diagnostic criteria were used (46.0-62.0%) and occurred rapidly after initiating opioid therapy. The use of prophylactic laxatives reduced the overall incidence rate of OIC from 71.0% to 47.4%. No baseline characteristics, except comorbidities, were associated with OIC incidence. Change from baseline to day 15 in PAC-SYM total score was significantly greater for patients with OIC versus those without OIC (0.188 versus -0.362; P\\u2009=\\u20090.0011).\\nThis post hoc analysis suggests that OIC occurs rapidly in patients with GI cancer after initiating opioid therapy, and negatively impacts QOL. Early and effective intervention strategies may be particularly useful in this group.\\nCoauthor Makio Gamoh is deceased. It is well known that pepsinogen (PGs), as an important precursor of pepsin performing digestive function, has a good correlation with the occurrence and development of gastric cancer and it is also known that ectopic PGs expression is related to the prognosis of some cancers. However, the panoramic picture of pepsinogen gene family in human cancer is not clear. This study focused on elucidating the expression profile, activated pathway, immune cells infiltration, mutation, and copy number variation of PGs and their potential role in human cancer.\\nBased on the next generation sequence data from TCGA, Oncomine, and CCLE, the molecular changes and clinical correlation of PGs in 33 tumor types were analyzed systematically by R language, including the expression, mutation, and copy number variation of PGs and their correlation with cancer-related signal transduction pathway, immune cell infiltration, and prognostic potential in different cancers.\\nPGs expression profiles appear different in 33 tumors. The transcriptional expression of PGs was detected in 16 of all 33 tumors. PGC was highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma and breast cancer, while decreased in stomach adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal carcinoma. PGA3, PGA4, and PGA5 were expressed in most normal tissues, but decreased in cancer tissues. PGs expression was significantly related to the activation or inhibition of many signal transduction pathways, in which PGC and PGA5 are more likely to be associated with cancer-related pathways. PGC participated in 33 regulatory network pathways in pan-cancer, mainly distributed in stomach adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. PGC and PGA3 expression were significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration. The results of survival analysis showed that different PGs expression play significantly different prognostic roles in different cancers. PGC was correlated with poor survival in brain lower grade glioma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and higher survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, mesothelioma, and uveal melanoma. PGA4 was only associated with higher survival in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. Genetic variation analysis showed that PGC gene often mutated in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma had extensive copy number amplification in various tumor types. PGC expression was upregulated with the increase of copy number in cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, while in stomach adenocarcinoma, PGC was upregulated regardless of whether the copy number was increased or decreased.\\nPGs was expressed unevenly in a variety of cancer tissues and was related to many carcinogenic pathways and involved in the immune regulation. PGC participated in 33 regulatory pathways in human cancer. Different PGs expression play significantly different prognostic roles in different cancers. The variation of copy number of PGC gene could affect the PGC expression. These findings suggested that PGs, especially PGC have characteristic of broad-spectrum expression in multiple cancers rather than being confined to the gastric mucosa, which may made PGs be useful biomarkers for prediction/diagnosis/prognosis and effective targets for treatment in human cancer. Esophagectomy often presents anastomotic leaks (AL), due to tenuous perfusion of gastric conduit fundus (GCF). Hybrid (endovascular/surgical) ischemic gastric preconditioning (IGP), might improve GCF perfusion. Sixteen pigs undergoing IGP were randomized: (1) Max-IGP ( Low health literacy is associated with factors such as not taking medication as prescribed as well as poor health status and increased hospitalization and mortality risk, and has been identified as a risk factor for decreased physical function in older individuals. Health literacy is becoming an increasingly important issue because of the increased number of people affected by cancer who must make complicated treatment decisions. Health literacy has been shown to be positively associated with quality of life (QOL), and social support has been identified as important for addressing health-related problems and reducing the relative risk of mortality in patients with cancer. However, few studies have examined the relationship between health literacy, social support, age, and QOL.\\nThe aim of this study is to examine the effects of health literacy, social support, and age on the QOL of patients with cancer.\\nAn anonymous, self-administered online questionnaire was conducted from March 28 to 30, 2017, in Japan on patients with lung, stomach, or colon cancer that were voluntarily registered with an internet survey company. The survey covered basic attributes, health literacy, social support, and QOL. The European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire, a comprehensive measure of health literacy instrument, was used to measure health literacy; the Japanese version of the Social Support Scale was used to measure social support; and the Japanese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (7-item version) assessment tool was used to measure QOL.\\nA total of 735 survey invitations were randomly sent to patients with lung, stomach, or colorectal cancer, and responses were obtained from 619 (82.2% response rate). Significant effects on the QOL in patients with lung, stomach, or colon cancer were observed for health literacy, social support, and age, and for the interactions of health literacy and social support and of social support and age. Health literacy, social support, and the interaction between these variables also showed a significant effect on the QOL in patients 50 years or older, but not on those younger than 50 years.\\nThe results of this study revealed that higher health literacy, social support, and age were associated with the QOL in patients with cancer. In addition, the relationship with QOL was stronger for social support than for health literacy. These findings suggest the importance of health literacy and social support and indicate that social support has a greater effect on QOL than does health literacy, while the QOL in patients with cancer aged younger than 50 years was lower than that of those 50 years or older. Therefore, elucidating the needs of these patients and strengthening social support based on those needs may improve their QOL. Gastric cancer is the third-most fatal cancer in the world. Though over the years, we saw patients mostly with intestinal type\\xa0accounting for the highest mortality rate, the recent rise of the diffuse form with germline E-cadherin (CDH1) mutations has added a whole new level of interest to study in detail about the association between CDH1 and diffuse gastric cancer (DGC). This introduced a set guideline\\xa0formulated by Internal Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) for patients with family history of diffuse gastric cancer and invasive lobular breast cancer (ILBC). The analysis of this link was also important to set proper management protocol for patients who were CDH1 mutation carriers which now involves genetic counselling, endoscopic surveillance and screening and prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG).\\xa0The study was conducted in accordance to the \\'PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic review and meta-analysis\\'. Peer-reviewed studies were included from the PubMed database and relevant articles were selected to be included in the study. Appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria with free full text English articles were applied while selecting the articles.\\xa0A total of 10 studies on review with different study populations showed that of the 42 patients who were diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer, 88% of them showed a positive germline E-cadherin gene mutation and 100% of the CDH1 mutation carriers showed microscopic changes of signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The beneficial effects of PTG\\xa0with better survival rates and low mortality rates has outweighed other treatment modalities. Laparoscopic approach has proved to be more useful and a safer approach for gastrectomy surgeries with better post-operative management. The need for prophylactic mastectomy is also increased in the recent times and thus this requires a new set of guidelines for ILBC\\xa0patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) syndrome. Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression and proteome diversity. Tumor-alternative splicing can reveal a large class of new splicing-associated potential new antigens that may affect the immune response and can be used for immunotherapy.\\nThe RNA-seq transcriptome data and clinical information of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) cohort were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database data portal, and data of splicing events were obtained from the SpliceSeq database. Predicting genes were validated by Asian cancer research group (ACRG) cohort and Oncomine database. RT-qPCR was used to analysis the expression of ECT2 in STAD.\\nA total of 32,166 AS events were identified, among which 2,042 AS events were significantly associated with patients survival. Biological pathway analysis indicated that these genes play an important role in regulating gastric cancer-related processes such as GTPase activity and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Next, we derived a risk signature, using alternate acceptor, that is an independent prognostic marker. Moreover, high ECT2 expression was associated with poorer prognosis in STAD. Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that high ECT2 expression was an independent risk factor for overall survival. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that high ECT2 expression was enriched for hallmarks of malignant tumors. The ACRG cohort and Oncomine also showed that high ECT2 expression was associated with poorer prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Finally, RT-qPCR showed ECT2 expression was higher in STAD compared to the normal tissues.\\nThis study excavated the alternative splicing events in gastric cancer, and found ECT2 might be a biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. In total, 123 IND cases with final diagnoses of cancer (29.3%), high-grade dysplasia (6.5%), low-grade dysplasia (11.4%), and nonneoplasm (52.8%) were randomly divided into test set (\\nBy image analysis, the only ratio of SAA to total IND area was associated with the final diagnosis (\\nStructural atypia was more helpful than nuclear atypia and SAA > 25% was the most powerful predictor for the diagnosis of INDs of the stomach. We propose shortening the follow-up period to six months for Category 1, endoscopic resection for Category 2 and 3, postresection follow-up periods of one year for Category 2, and six months for Category 3. The BRCA mutation (BRCAm) in males has been reported to confer a higher risk for the development of various tumors. However, little is known about its clinicopathologic features and prognostic implications.\\nWe conducted a retrospective pan-tumor survey on 346 cases of BRCA-associated tumors in males. Comparative analyses were conducted among male and female patients with BRCAm (n\\u2009=\\u2009349), as well as in male patients without BRCAm (n\\u2009=\\u20094577).\\nSimilar incidences of BRCAm (6.0 vs. 6.6%) and age at diagnosis of tumor (median, 65 vs. 60\\u2009years) were observed in male and female patients. Carcinomas of the lung, bladder, stomach, and cutaneous melanoma were the frequent tumors demonstrating BRCAm in males, of which the majority were stage II or III diseases with a higher frequency of BRCA2 mutations. Compared to that in the non-BRCAm group, cutaneous melanoma (16.3 vs. 5.0%), lung cancer (19.4 vs. 11.8%), bladder cancer (15.6 vs. 5.6%), and stomach cancer (11.9 vs. 5.5%) accounted for a higher proportion in the BRCAm group. Advanced disease and more mutation counts (median, 322 vs. 63 mutations) were also found in the BRCAm group. A total of 127 BRCA1 and 311 BRCA2 mutations were identified, of which 21.8 and 28.6% were deleterious, respectively. Frequent deleterious variants were identified in carcinomas of the breast (100.0%), colorectum (62.2%), prostate (43.3%), and stomach (42.9%). BRCA1 fusions with NF1, FAM134C, BECN1, or LSM12 and recurrent BRCA2 mutations at P606L/S, E832K/G, and T3033Lfs*29 were detected. Frameshift mutations in BRCA2 at N1784 (N1784Kfs*3, N1784Tfs*3) were frequently observed in both male and female patients. Compared with those in females, BRCA mutations in males were associated with decreased overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Male patients with deleterious BRCAm displayed increased OS compared with non-BRCAm carriers. The subgroup analysis demonstrated that BRCAm was associated with increased OS in gastric and bladder cancers, decreased PFS in prostate, esophageal, and head and neck cancers, and decreased OS in glioma/glioblastoma in males.\\nThese findings provide an overview of the distinct characteristics and clinical outcomes of male patients with BRCA-associated tumors, suggesting the importance of further genetic BRCA testing in males. In recent years, the overall incidence of gastric cancer has been decreasing worldwide, while the incidence of the esophagogastric junction tumor is increasing year by year. With the progress of the diagnostic technology of upper gastrointestinal tumors and the gradual popularization of early cancer screening, the detection rate of early esophagogastric junction tumor keeps increasing. Therefore, in recent years, the clinical application of gastric function preserving surgery is gradually increasing. As an important part of the surgical treatment strategy of esophagogastric junction tumors, proximal gastrectomy has attracted more and more attention with the confirmation of oncological safety. Compared with total gastrectomy, patients after proximal gastrectomy have better nutritional status and quality of life. However, the high incidence of reflux esophagitis after traditional proximal gastrectomy has seriously affected the quality of life of patients, and also hindered the application of proximal gastrectomy in esophagogastric junction tumors. How to reduce the occurrence of reflux esophagitis after proximal gastrectomy by optimizing the method of digestive tract reconstruction has been a big challenge in clinical practice. This article reviews the current methods of anti-reflux surgery for proximal gastrectomy for esophagogastric junction tumors, aiming to provide a reference for choosing a reasonable anti-reflux surgery.\\n近年来，全球范围内胃癌的整体发病率呈下降趋势，而食管胃结合部肿瘤的发病率却在逐年上升。随着上消化道肿瘤诊断技术的进步和早癌普查的逐步推广，早期食管胃结合部肿瘤的检出率逐年增加。因此，近年来保留胃功能手术的临床应用逐渐增多。近端胃切除术作为食管胃结合部肿瘤外科治疗策略的重要组成部分，随着肿瘤学安全性的证实，其在食管胃结合部肿瘤中的临床应用价值正在日益得到重视。相较于全胃切除，近端胃切除术后患者有更好的营养状态和生活质量。然而，传统的近端胃切除术后反流性食管炎较高的发生率严重影响了患者术后生活质量，同时也阻碍了近端胃切除术在食管胃结合部肿瘤中的应用。如何通过优化消化道重建方式来降低近端胃切除术后反流性食管炎的发生，一直是临床工作中的难题。本文就目前食管胃结合部肿瘤近端胃切除防反流术式进行了综述。. The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) continues to rise. While many treatment modalities are available, surgery is still the basis of comprehensive treatment of AEG. Siewert type II AEG, is more controversial than the other two types in terms of lymph node metastasis, surgical approach, extent of resection, and digestive tract reconstruction. When the distance of the superior tumor margin is more than 3 cm proximal to the EGJ line is more than 3 cm, thorough mediastinal lymph node dissection should be performed through thoracic approach. Total gastrectomy is the treatment of choice for Siewert type II tumors. When the tumor stage is in an early stage, the length of the tumor is ≤4 cm, and esophageal involvement is less than 3 cm, transthoracic esophagectomy plus proximal gastrectomy is feasible. The digestive tract reconstruction can be based on the experience of the operator and patient\\'s choice of conditions.\\n食管胃结合部腺癌（AEG）发病率持续上升，其治疗模式较多，但是外科手术仍然是AEG综合治疗的基础。SiewertⅠ型和Siewert Ⅲ型分别参照食管癌和胃癌的分期系统进行治疗策略的选择，而对于Siewert Ⅱ型目前尚未达成共识。本文将对SiewertⅡ型AEG在淋巴结转移、手术入路和切除范围以及消化道重建等方面存在的诸多争议，进行简要阐述。结合当前文献以及笔者经验，建议当肿瘤浸润食管≥3 cm时，应经胸入路行彻底纵隔淋巴结清扫+全胃切除术；当肿瘤分期较早、肿瘤长径≤4 cm、且食管受累<3 cm时可经食管裂孔近端胃切除术+食管切除术。而消化道重建方式可据术者经验和患者自身条件进行选择。.      The detection rate of submucosal tumors in the gastric cardia increases year by year. Most of these tumors are benign or borderline tumors, among which leiomyoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor are more common. The functional preservation of the gastric cardiac region is closely related to the anatomical structure of the esophagogastric junction. The esophageal reflux is mainly evaluated directly or indirectly by upper gastrointestinal radiography, gastroscopy, CT examination and manometric measurements of the lower esophagus. For tumors at this specific region, the risk of lymph node metastasis is very low, and according to the tumor free principle, usually only complete removal of the tumor is required. We aim to introduce the minimally invasive and function preserving procedures, including endoscopic therapy alone, laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery\\n胃贲门区黏膜下肿瘤检出率逐年上升，多数为良性或者交界性肿瘤，其中平滑肌瘤、胃肠间质瘤较为常见。贲门区的功能保留与食管胃结合部区域的解剖结构密切相关，其中防止食管反流这一功能的评价主要通过上消化道造影、胃镜、CT和食管下段括约肌压力测定等方法直接或间接评价。这个特殊解剖部位的肿瘤，淋巴结转移风险很低，遵循无瘤原则，通常只需完整切除肿瘤即可。本文旨在介绍胃贲门区黏膜下肿瘤功能保留的微创化治疗方法，包括单纯内镜下治疗、内镜和腹腔镜联合手术及完全腹腔镜手术。这些治疗方法要根据肿瘤位置、大小、形态、生长方式（胃腔内或外）及手术团队水平等情况进行个体化的选择。. The surgical treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC) is undergoing the development of minimally invasive, precise and individualized treatment. The concept is changing from simple emphasis on radical treatment to giving consideration to both radical treatment and functional preservation. Combined laparoscopy-endoscopy local resection can achieve accurate resection of the lesions of EGC and solve the problem of lymph node dissection which cannot be performed in endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). At present, there are several methods of combined laparoscopy-endoscopy local resection for EGC, such as laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR), endoscopy-assisted wedge resection (EAWR), combined laparoscopic and endoscopic approach for neoplasia with a non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET), and non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS). These methods of local resection have the advantages of minimal invasion, shorter operation time, and less blood loss compared to conventional gastrectomy. Concerning the issue of lymph node dissection in combined laparoscopy-endoscopy surgery, sentinel node navigation can be the solution, although cumbersome intraoperative lymph node tracing, operative failure and false negative still exist. As a developing treatment for EGC, combined laparoscopy-endoscopy local resection will have a good application prospect in the future.\\n早期胃癌的手术治疗正经历着微创化、精准化、个体化的发展，从单纯强调根治到根治与功能保留并重的理念方向改变。腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术可以做到早期胃癌病灶精准切除，因为相对于内镜黏膜下剥离术（ESD），内镜下胃壁的全层切除保障了肿瘤的垂直切缘的可靠性，而腹腔镜技术不但可以起到辅助内镜下进行全层切除，缝合胃壁缺损，更解决了ESD所欠缺的淋巴结清扫问题。目前，腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术有腹腔镜辅助的内镜下全层切除、内镜辅助的腹腔镜楔形切除术、非暴露技术腹腔镜-内镜联合入路肿瘤切除术和非暴露内镜下胃壁翻转术等。尽管每种双镜联合的治疗方法都存在缺陷，但是相较传统胃切除手术，具有创伤小、手术时间较短、术中出血较少等特点。淋巴结清扫问题是早期胃癌腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术的另一个重要问题，然而，现阶段的前哨淋巴结可能仍然存在术中淋巴结示踪操作略显繁琐的问题，并存在一定失败率，而且术中淋巴结活检存在一定比例的假阴性率等因素，限制了其在早期胃癌手术治疗的临床应用。但作为一种发展中的早期胃癌精准治疗手段，相信器械设备技术的发展会使腹腔镜-内镜联合局部胃切除手术方法操作性更强，其应用前景值得期待。. Function-preserving gastrectomy, especially pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG), can improve the quality of life and has been widely recognized. With the development of surgical techniques and equipment, nerve preservation has become a new requirement in the era of \"precision medicine\", but the preservation of celiac branch of the vagal nerve remains controversial in gastric cancer surgery. Current researches have shown that the preservation of celiac branch of the vagal nerve is safe and feasible in patients with early gastric cancer. Although controversial, nerve preservation may play a role in preventing gallstones, regulating gastric emptying, reducing dumping syndrome, alleviating chronic diarrhea, reducing gastroesophageal reflux, and inhibiting bile reflux. The significance of the celiac branch of the vagal nerve in gastric cancer surgery is worth further attention and exploration to promote the development of function-preserving gastrectomy and improve the quality of life of patients.\\n功能保留性胃切除术，尤其是保留幽门及迷走神经胃部分切除术（PPG）可以提高胃癌患者术后的生活质量，得到了学术界的广泛认可。随着外科技术和设备的发展，保留神经已成为\"精准医疗\"时代的新要求，但在胃癌手术中，对迷走神经腹腔支的保留一直存在争议。目前的研究已经表明，保留迷走神经的腹腔支在早期胃癌患者中是安全可行的。保留腹腔支在胃癌手术中的价值虽有争议，但在预防胆结石、调节胃排空、减少倾倒综合征、缓解慢性腹泻、减少胃食管反流及抑制胆汁反流方面可能发挥一定作用。随着外科手术进入个体化精准治疗时代，迷走神经腹腔支在胃癌手术中的意义值得在未来进一步关注和探索，以推动功能保留性胃切除术的发展，提高患者的生活质量。. Segmental gastrectomy with cardia preservation can reduce the symptoms of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux and improve the quality of life, which is potentially advantageous among function-preserving gastrectomy procedures. However, due to the limited extent of excision, this procedure is classified as an investigational treatment in the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines, without wide acceptance in clinical practice. It is generally believed that the surgical indication of segmental gastrectomy is more selected compared to the pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, and there are also differences between their therapeutic goals. The indications of cardia preservation in segmental gastrectomy mainly depend on the T stage, the distance of the resection margin and the metastasis of lymph nodes. Other points of segmental gastrectomy mainly include the scope of lymphadenectomy, the preservation of blood vessels and vagal nerves, which are still controversial in different researches. High-quality evidences are needed to confirm the safety and long-term efficacy of the segmental gastrectomy.\\n胃节段切除术是指保留贲门与幽门的胃壁环周性切除的一种手术方法。由于其保留了贲门结构，因此可以减轻患者术后食管反流症状，提高生活质量，在功能保留性胃切除术中具有潜在优势。由于切除范围的局限性，该术式在日本胃癌治疗指南中被列为研究性的手术方式，尚未在临床中得到广泛开展。通常认为，胃节段切除术适用范围及手术平面应高于保留幽门胃切除术，同时，两者的概念与治疗理念也存在差异。术中保留贲门的指征，主要取决于肿瘤T分期、切缘安全距离及淋巴结转移情况。胃节段切除术中的淋巴结清扫范围、血管及迷走神经的存留等问题，目前在不同的临床研究中还存在争议，有待进一步研究，以证实其手术安全性及远期效果。. Segmental gastrectomy is a common function preserving operation, and its combination with sentinel lymph node navigation technology shows a broad prospect in the treatment of early gastric cancer. Commonly anastomosis methods include the follows: (1) Hand-sewn anastomosis: this method is relatively simple, reduces the use of stapler, and can effectively reduce surgical cost. However, laparotomy or small-incision assisted laparoscopic surgery is required to accomplish anastomosis, so the surgical wound is relatively large. (2) Delta anastomosis: this anastomosis is entirely endoscopic, requiring no small incision with less surgical trauma. However, due to the presence of residual cavities in the small curvature of the side-to-side anastomosis, and the possibility of excessive incision of the posterior wall of the stomach, which may shorten the pyloric sleeve, there is an increased risk of gastric stasis after the operation. (3) Hybrid technique: this anastomosis method is safe and effective. However, it requires total endoscopic gastric anterior wall suture, which represents higher requirements for surgeons. Therefore, surgeons experienced in minimally invasive surgeries are recommended to perform this anastomosis. (4) Puncture technique: this anastomotic method is end-to-end anastomosis with low risk of gastric stasis, and is applicable for entirely endoscopic anastomosis. However, the stapler is not typically used for gastrointestinal surgery, which brings certain limitations to clinical promotion. These anastomoses have their own advantages and disadvantages, and their effects on gastric function are also controversial. In conclusion, the development of segmental gastrectomy is still in its infancy, and prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials are awaited to confirm the safety of oncology and standardize the techniques.\\n胃节段切除术是目前较为常见的功能保留性胃切除术之一，其联合前哨淋巴结导航技术在早期胃癌的治疗中展现出广阔的应用前景。胃节段切除术后常见的吻合方式包括：（1）手工吻合：该操作相对简便，减少了吻合器的使用，可有效降低手术成本，常需开腹或小切口辅助完成吻合。（2）Delta吻合：该吻合为全腔镜下吻合，手术创伤小，但由于侧-侧吻合小弯侧存在残腔，且有可能过度切割胃后壁而缩短幽门袖，增加术后胃潴留的风险；（3）杂交法吻合：该吻合方式安全有效，但需行全腔镜下缝合胃前壁，对术者技术要求较高，建议由腹腔镜胃肠手术经验丰富的医师开展；（4）穿刺法吻合：该吻合方式为端-端吻合，胃潴留风险低，且适用于全腔镜下吻合，但使用的吻合器比较特殊，给临床推广带来了一定的限制。这几种吻合方式各有利弊，对胃功能的影响亦存在争议。总而言之，胃节段切除术的发展尚处于初级阶段，肿瘤学安全性的确认、技术的标准化等，仍需前瞻性多中心的随机对照研究来提供理论与技术支持。. The proportion of early gastric cancer is rising and the prognosis of locally advanced gastric cancer is improved in China in recent years. To meet the patients\\' increasing demand for quality of life, function reconstruction and preserving surgery become our focus. The main physiological functions of the stomach include the maintenance of gastrointestinal continuity, the storage of chyme and initial digestion. With different kinds of surgery, these physiological functions can be partly reconstructed or preserved. However, the main challenge we are facing is the lack of evidence. To set an objective method to evaluate the quality of life for function reconstruction surgery and to verify the oncological efficacy of function preserving surgery are the problems we need to solve. Conducting related studies to lay the foundation for function reconstruction and preserving surgery is an important future direction for Chinese surgeons.\\n随着中国早期胃癌比例增加，局部进展期胃癌预后改善，以及患者对术后生活质量要求的相应提高，胃功能重建手术和功能保留手术已成为学术界的关注重点。胃的主要生理功能包括生理通道、储存食物和初步消化等。不同的手术方式可以在一定程度上实现保留或重建不同的生理功能。功能重建手术生活质量评价标准的制定，以及功能保留手术肿瘤根治性的验证是亟待解决的问题。中国学者应该未雨绸缪，积极关注与开展胃癌功能重建及功能保留手术方面的相关研究和临床工作，以争取为患者带来更好的生活质量。. Osteoporosis (OP) and osteoporotic fractures (OFs) are common multifactorial and heterogenic disorders of increasing incidence.   Selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum, namely ER-phagy, is mediated by ER-localized receptors, which are recognized and sequestered by GABARAP/LC3B-decorated phagophores, and transferred to lysosomes for degradation. Being one such receptor, FAM134B plays critical roles in cellular processes such as protein quality control and neuronal survival. FAM134B has also been associated with different cancers, although its exact role remains elusive. We report here that the FAM134B gene encodes not one but at least two different protein isoforms; the full length, and the N-terminally truncated forms. Their relative expression shows extreme variation, both within normal tissues and among cancer types. Expression of full length FAM134B is restricted to the brain, testis, spleen and prostate. In contrast, N-terminally truncated FAM134B is dominant in the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas and liver. We compared wild-type and knockout mice to study the role of the Fam134b gene in starvation. N-terminally truncated FAM134B-2 was induced in the liver, skeletal muscle and heart, but not in the pancreas and stomach following starvation. Upon starvation, Fam134b This article analyses some parameters and characteristics of CT images on gastric cancer patients, and discusses the application of CT images in the diagnosis of gastric cancer endocrine nerves and the impact of nursing intervention on the quality and mental state of CT imaging images of gastric cancer patients. First, all patients were scanned with CT images, and the CT values of the normal stomach wall and all lesions at different single energy levels were recorded separately. Secondly, the improved BP network model was applied to realize the diagnosis of gastric cancer through the analysis of various features of CT images. Finally, the effect of nursing intervention on the image quality and mental state of CT imaging of gastric cancer patients was studied. The results show that the energy spectrum curve of CT images and the improved BP network model are helpful for the initial diagnosis and identification of gastric cancer. At the same time, nursing intervention has a good influence on the clinical examination, image diagnosis and psychological state of patients with gastric cancer, and it is easy for patients to undergo image diagnosis and examination according to correct operating procedures. Robotic gastrectomy (RG) is more and more widely used in the treatment of gastric cancer. However, the long-term oncological outcomes of RG have not been well evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term oncological outcomes of RG and laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) in the treatment of gastric cancer.\\nPubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Cochrane Library and EMBASE electronic databases were searched until August 2019. Eligible studies were analysed for comparison of oncological outcomes between RG and LG in patients with gastric cancer.\\nEleven retrospective comparative studies, which included 1347 (32.52%) patients in the RG group and 2795 (67.48%) patients in the LG group, were selected for the analysis. Meta-analysis of the 11 included studies showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the OS between the RG and LG groups (hazard ratios [HRs] = 0.97, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 0.80-1.19, P = 0.80). Six studies evaluated disease-free survival (DFS), and pooled analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in DFS between RG group and LG group (HR = 0.94, 95% CIs = 0.72-1.23, P = 0.65). According to the odds ratio (OR) analysis, there was no significant difference in 3-year OS, 5-year OS, 3-year DFS and 5-year DFS between the RG and LG groups. Nine articles reported the recurrence rate, and the meta-analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the RG and LG groups (OR = 0.88, 95% CIs = 0.69-1.12, P = 0.31).\\nThis meta-analysis indicated that the long-term oncological outcomes in the RG group were similar to that in the LG group. Animal models of total-body irradiation (TBI) are used to elucidate normal tissue damage and evaluate the efficacy of medical countermeasures (MCM). The accuracy of these TBI models depends on the reproducibility of the radiation dose-response relationship for lethality, which in turn is highly dependent on robust radiation physics and dosimetry. However, the precise levels of radiation each organ absorbs can change dramatically when different photon beam qualities are used, due to the interplay between their penetration and the natural variation of animal sizes and geometries. In this study, we evaluate the effect of varying the radiation energy, namely cobalt-60 (Co-60); of similar penetration to a 4-MV polyenergetic beam), 6 MV and 15 MV, in the absorbed dose delivered by TBI to individual organs of eight Göttingen minipigs of varying weights (10.3-24.1 kg) and dimensions (17.5-25 cm width). The main organs, i.e. heart, lungs, esophagus, stomach, bowels, liver, kidneys and bladder, were contoured by an experienced radiation oncologist, and the volumetric radiation dose distribution was calculated using a commercial treatment planning system commissioned and validated for Co-60, 6-MV and 15-MV teletherapy units. The dose is normalized to the intended prescription at midline in the abdomen. For each animal and each energy, the body and organ dose volume histograms (DVHs) were computed. The results show that more penetrating photon energies produce dose distributions that are systematically and consistently more homogeneous and more uniform, both within individual organs and between different organs, across all animals. Thoracic organs (lungs, heart) received higher dose than prescribed while pelvic organs (bowel, bladder) received less dose than prescribed, due to smaller and wider separations, respectively. While these trends were slightly more pronounced in the smallest animals (10.3 kg, 19 cm abdominal width) and largest animals (>20 kg, ∼25 cm abdominal width), they were observed in all animals, including those in the 9-15 kg range typically used in MCM models. Some organs received an average absorbed dose representing <80% of prescribed dose when Co-60 was used, whereas all organs received average doses of >87% and >93% when 6 and 15 MV were used, respectively. Similarly, average dose to the thoracic organs reached as high as 125% of the intended dose with Co-60, compared to 115% for 15 MV. These results indicate that Co-60 consistently produces less uniform dose distributions in the Göttingen minipig compared to 6 and 15 MV. Moreover, heterogeneity of dose distributions for Co-60 is accentuated by anatomical and geometrical variations across various animals, leading to different absorbed dose delivered to organs for different animals. This difference in absorbed radiation organ doses, likely caused by the lower penetration of Co-60 and 6 MV compared to 15 MV, could potentially lead to different biological outcomes. While the link between the dose distribution and variation of biological outcome in the Göttingen minipig has never been explicitly studied, more pronounced dose heterogeneity within and between organs treated with Co-60 teletherapy units represents an additional confounding factor which can be easily mitigated by using a more penetrating energy. Gastric epithelium operates in a hazardous environment that curtails the lifespan of the constituent cells, imposing a requirement for continuous epithelial renewal. Stem cells that reside in the stomach are thus essential for regulating physiological tissue renewal and injury repair because of their self-renewal, high proliferation capacity and multiple differentiation potentials. Recent investigations using lineage tracing models have identified diverse populations of gastric stem cells and even fully differentiated cells that can regain stem cell capacity, so enriching our understanding on the identity and plasticity of gastric stem cells. These cell populations include the Villin promotor, Lgr5  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer (AFPGC) is a relatively rare type of gastric cancer (GC). To improve the early diagnosis and treatment of AFPGC, we thoroughly investigated the clinicopathological features and prognosis of AFPGC. 139 GC patients who had received treatment from January 2013 to March 2016 in Jinan Central Hospital were included in this study. Blood samples for the pretreatment AFP examinations were collected. The relationship between the serum AFP and the clinicopathological features and prognosis were analyzed. Among the 139 GC cases, 16 cases (11.5%) were AFPGC patients. Compared with the AFP-negative (non-AFPGC) group, the AFPGC patients were prone to have distant metastasis (P=0.029), particularly in the liver, and the abdominal metastasis accounted for 79.4% (27/34). AFPGC patients\\' cancer is clearly prone to occur in the upper third of the stomach (P=0.008) and among younger (≤60 years old) patients (P=0.044). Furthermore, among the young and middle-aged (≤60 years old) patients, there were no significant differences in the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), the cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), or the combined (CEA+CA19-9) positive rate between the AFPGC and the non-AFPGC patients. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the median overall survival (mOS) of patients with AFPGC was significantly less than it was among the non-AFPGC patients (P=0.042). The serum AFP level (<100 ng/ml vs ≥100 ng/ml) is a prognostic factor for overall survival in AFPGC patients (P=0.041). In conclusion, the real-time examination of serum AFP has great diagnostic and prognostic value for managing AFPGC, especially for young and middle-aged patients. Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis denotes the infiltration of tumor cells into the lung parenchymal lymphatic channels. Breast, lung, stomach, and colon adenocarcinoma are the most common origin of this invasion pattern. The micropapillary variant of colorectal adenocarcinoma has a high rate of lymph node metastases and poor overall survival. A 49\\xa0year-old man with a 6\\xa0months history of persistent cough and a relevant occupational chemical exposure had a computed tomography that showed bilateral interstitial lung infiltrates. The lung biopsy demonstrated a micropapillary adenocarcinoma with diffusely obstruction of the lung parenchymal lymphatics. The immunohistochemistry confirmed a colorectal origin. The colonoscopy evidenced a mass with identical morphology. Colorectal micropapillary carcinoma with metastatic lung lymphangitic carcinomatosis can occur, as a persistent cough, as presenting symptom in extraordinarily rare cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an alive patient with colorectal metastatic micropapillary carcinoma presenting with lymphangitic lung carcinomatosis. Exposure of gastric epithelial cells to the bacterial carcinogen Helicobacter pylori causes DNA double strand breaks. Here, we show that H. pylori-induced DNA damage occurs co-transcriptionally in S-phase cells that activate NF-κB signaling upon innate immune recognition of the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic intermediate β-ADP-heptose by the ALPK1/TIFA signaling pathway. DNA damage depends on the bi-functional RfaE enzyme and the Cag pathogenicity island of H. pylori, is accompanied by replication fork stalling and can be observed also in primary cells derived from gastric organoids. Importantly, H. pylori-induced replication stress and DNA damage depend on the presence of co-transcriptional RNA/DNA hybrids (R-loops) that form in infected cells during S-phase as a consequence of β-ADP-heptose/ ALPK1/TIFA/NF-κB signaling. H. pylori resides in close proximity to S-phase cells in the gastric mucosa of gastritis patients. Taken together, our results link bacterial infection and NF-κB-driven innate immune responses to R-loop-dependent replication stress and DNA damage. Although vertigo is one of the most common complaints, intracranial malignant tumors rarely cause sudden asymmetry between the tone of the vestibular peripheries masquerading as a peripheral-like disorder. Here we report a case of simultaneous temporal bone infiltrating macro-metastasis and disseminated multi-organ micro-metastases presenting as acute unilateral vestibular syndrome, due to the reawakening of a primary gastric signet ring cell carcinoma. Purpose - Our objective was to identify those pathophysiological steps that may explain the complex process of tumor reawakening, dissemination. The possible causes of vestibular asymmetry were also traced.\\nA 56-year-old male patient\\'s interdisciplinary medical data had been retrospectively analyzed. Original clinical and pathological results have been collected and thoroughly reevaluated, then new histological staining and immunohistochemistry methods have been added to the diagnostic pool.\\nDuring the autopsy the cerebrum and cerebellum was edematous. The apex of the left petrous bone was infiltrated and destructed by a tumor mass of 2x2 cm in size. Histological reexamination of the original gastric resection specimen slides revealed focal submucosal tumorous infiltration with a vascular invasion. By immunohistochemistry mainly single infiltrating tumor cells were observed with Cytokeratin 7 and Vimentin positivity and partial loss of E-cadherin staining. The subsequent histological examination of necropsy tissue specimens confirmed the disseminated, multi-organ microscopic tumorous invasion. Discussion - It has been recently reported that the expression of Vimentin and the loss of E-cadherin is significantly associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular and neural invasion and undifferentiated type with p<0.05 significance. As our patient was middle aged and had no immune-deficiency, the promoting factor of the reawakening of the primary GC malignant disease after a 9-year-long period of dormancy remained undiscovered. The organ-specific tropism explained by the \"seed and soil\" theory was unexpected, due to rare occurrence of gastric cancer to metastasize in the meninges given that only a minority of these cells would be capable of crossing the blood brain barrier.\\nPatients with past malignancies and new onset of neurological symptoms should alert the physician to central nervous system involvement, and the appropriate, targeted diagnostic and therapeutic work-up should be established immediately. Targeted staining with specific antibodies is recommended. Recent studies on cell lines indicate that metformin strongly inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, further studies need to be performed on cases positive for epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\\nCélkitûzés – Bár a szédülés a leggyakrabban elôforduló panaszok egyike, a vestibularis perifériák hirtelen kialakult tónusaszimmetriája hátterében mégis ritkán találunk peri\\xadfériás eredetû betegséget utánzó malignus koponyaûri tumorokat. Dolgozatunk egy heveny vestibularis szindróma klinikai képében jelentkezô, késôi, temporalis csontot is beszûrô, disszeminált, generalizált mikrometa\\xadsztá\\xadzi\\xadsok\\xadkal járó meningitis carcinomatosa esetet mutat be, ami egy primer pecsétgyûrûsejtes gyomorcarcinoma fel\\xadébredé\\xadsét követôen jelent meg. Kérdésfelvetés – Célul tûztük ki, hogy azonosítjuk azon patofiziológiai folyamatokat, melyek magyarázatul szolgálhatnak a daganat felébredésére, disszeminációjára. A vestibularis tónusaszimmetria lehetséges okait szintén vizsgáltuk.\\nÖtvenhat éves férfi betegünk interdiszciplináris orvosi adatait retrospektíven elemeztük. Összegyûjtöttük és részletesen újraértékeltük az eredeti klinikai és patológiai vizsgálatok leleteit, majd új szövettani festésekkel és immunhisztokémiai módszerekkel egészítettük ki a diagnosztikus eljárásokat.\\nKórboncolás során a nagyagy és a kisagy oedamás volt. A bal piramiscsont csúcsát egy 2 × 2 cm nagyságú daganatmassza szûrte be. A gyomorreszekátum eredeti szövettani metszeteinek újraértékelése submucosus daganatinfiltrációt igazolt vascularis invázió jeleivel. Immunhisztokémiai vizsgálatokkal dominálóan magányosan infiltráló daganatsejteket láttunk cytokeratin 7- és vimentinpozitivitással, valamint részleges E-kadherin szövettani festésvesztéssel. A kórboncolás során nyert szövetminták ezt követô hisztológiai vizsgálatai igazolták a disszeminált, többszervi mikroszkopikus daganatinváziót.\\nAz újabb eredmények igazolták, hogy a vimentin kifejezôdése, valamint az E-kadherin elvesztése szignifikáns (p < 0,05) kapcsolatot mutat az elôrehaladott stádiummal, a nyirokcsomóáttétek jelenlétével, a vascularis és neuralis invázióval, valamint a nem differenciált szöveti típussal. Betegünk középkorú volt és nem volt immunhiányos állapotban, így a gyomorcarcinoma kilenc éven át tartó alvó állapotot követô felébredését nem tudtuk megmagyarázni. A daganat szervspecifikus tropizmusa, melyet a „seed and soil” teóriával magyaráznánk, kifejezetten váratlan volt, mivel a gyomorrákok ritkán képeznek áttétet az agyburkokon, hiszen a daganatsejtek elenyészô számban jutnak át a vér-agy gáton. Következtetések – Az elôzményben szereplô malignus folyamat, valamint egy új neurológiai tünet megjelenése fel kell, hogy keltse a klinikus figyelmét a központi ideg\\xadrendszer daganatos érintettségére, melyet adekvát, célzott diagnosztikus és terápiás stratégia megtervezése kell, hogy kövessen. Ehhez célzott szövettani festési eljárások, specifikus antitestek alkalmazása szükséges. A közelmúlt eredményei sejtkultúrákon igazolták a metformin epithelialis-mesenchymalis transitiót erôsen gátló hatását gyomor\\xadrák esetében. Így további kutatást kell végezni azon esetekben, amelyekben az epithelialis-mesenchymalis transitióra pozitív eredményeket kapunk. A metachronous neoplasm can develop in a gastric conduit used for reconstruction after esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer. Surgical resection is sometimes necessary to treat this neoplasm. We report a method for performing minimally invasive gastrectomy with preservation of the proximal residual stomach through laparotomy for cancer in the distal side of gastric conduit after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. Furthermore, Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed after gastrectomy. This minimally invasive partial gastrectomy for early gastric conduit cancer and followed Roux-en-Y reconstruction may lead to a favorable clinical outcome. Gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (GNEC) is rare cancer detected in the stomach. Previously, we demonstrated that the poorer prognosis of GNEC patients compared with gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) patients was probably due to the lack of response to chemotherapy. Thus, it is crucial to study the specific GNEC gene expression pattern and investigate chemoresistance mechanism of GNEC. The transcriptome of GNEC patients was compared with that of GAC patients using RNA-seq. The KEGG analysis was employed to explore the specific differential expression gene function enrichment pattern. In addition, the transcriptomes of two GNEC cell lines, ECC10 and ECC12, were also compared with those of two GAC cell lines, MGC-803 and AGS, using RNA-seq. Comparing patient samples and cell lines transcriptome data, we try to uncover the potential targets and pathways which may affect the chemoresistance of GNEC. By combing all transcriptome data, we identified 22 key genes that were specifically up-regulated in GNEC. This panel of genes probably involves in the chemoresistance of GNEC. From our current experimental data, NeuroD1, one of the 22 genes, is associated with the prognosis of GNEC patients. Knockdown of NeuroD1 enhanced the sensitivity to irinotecan of GNEC cell lines. Our research sheds light in identifying a panel of novel therapeutic target specifically for GNEC clinical treatment which has not been reported before.  PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy has been widely used for the clinical treatment of cancer. However, recent clinical trials have shown that only a small proportion of cancer patients respond to PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. The tumor immune microenvironment plays an important regulatory role in PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Macrophages are one of the most important immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment. In this study, we found a high correlation between macrophage infiltration and PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer (GC) specimens. Further study revealed that infiltrated macrophages released the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-ɑ and IL-6, which induced PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. The release of TNF-ɑ and IL-6 activated the NF-kB and STAT3 signaling pathway to regulate PD-L1 expression. TNF-α, p-65 and STAT3 expression in cancer patients has prognostic value in stomach adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, infiltrated macrophages can also promote GC cell proliferation by inducing PD-L1 expression in GC cells. Taken together, our results suggest that macrophages play a dual role in regulating the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells. On the one hand, macrophages induce PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, helping tumor cells escape cytotoxic T cell killing; on the other hand, they can promote the proliferation of tumor cells by regulating the expression of PD-L1. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are B-cell neoplasms that commonly affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, usually the stomach. In most cases, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (ENMZL) is an indolent disease. Bone marrow involvement is common with MALT lymphoma accompanied by paraproteinemia; such involvement impels disease progression. Here, we present the case of an 82-year-old Hispanic patient with long-standing ENMZL in whom the gastric site responded to antibiotic treatment and Helicobacter pylori eradication, but the disease progressed over the years, with a biclonal gammopathy and bone marrow involvement with marked plasmacytic differentiation. In view of this, we suggest the routine evaluation of paraprotein in patients with ENMZL. Dieulafoy lesion (DL), a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, is easily covered by blood scab formation on the mucous membrane for its small size, which makes it difficult to be identified under endoscope. In clinical practice, it is also very easy to miss gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma that exhibits atypical early manifestations under gastroendoscope and is difficult to be diagnosed by routine superficial biopsy. Most patients only experience nonspecific dyspepsia symptoms.\\nA 68-year-old man suffering from repeated melena for 6 years arrived at our hospital. The patient had undergone gastroscopy and capsule endoscopy at other hospitals for several times and received symptomatic treatment, but his melena still continued to recur. At our hospital, the capsule endoscopy displayed that there existed large hemorrhage in the stomach, after which a gastrointestinal decompression tube was placed, so the bright red blood was drained. Subsequently, a sunken vascular malformation tissue in the anterior wall of the gastric fundus was observed under emergency endoscope. Pulsating blood flow appeared immediately after biopsy, and over-the-scope clip (OTSC) was quickly applied to stop the bleeding. Near the bleeding point, scar-like tissue that was surrounded by interrupted mucosa was discovered, and biopsy was performed at this site.\\nThe diagnosis of DL and gastric MALT were determined by the digestive endoscopy and biopsy pathology.\\nWith the diagnosis of DL and gastric MALT, the hemorrhagic spot was treated by OTSC. After the patient\\'s condition was stable, anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment was performed.\\nAfter the corresponding treatment, the 6-month follow-up revealed that the lymphoma was not completely cured, but no further bleeding occurred. There was no bleeding in the epigastric region and the patient was in good condition.\\nFrom endoscopy, it is easy to miss DL. When the hemostatic equipment is fully prepared, biopsy can be performed. After biopsy, pulsatile bleeding is convincing evidence for Dieulafoy disease. OTSC represents an effective and low-risk method for DL and it could replace surgery. Moreover, the mucosa surrounding Dieulafoy disease should be carefully observed to exclude coexisting diseases such as lymphoma or gastric cancer. Signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach is prone to relapse and metastasis after traditional surgical treatment, and the prognosis is also poor. We improved the concept of treatment and conducted cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) combined with intraperitoneal (IP) and intravenous (IV) chemotherapy for a gastric signet-cell carcinoma patient.\\nA 65-year-old male patient with complaint of intermittent hematemesis for over 10 days was referred to our hospital for treatment. The patient developed hematemesis of 800\\u200amL without obvious causes on May 27, 2015, accompanied by dizziness and amaurosis fugax. After the bleeding was stopped with medicinal treatment, diagnostic gastroscopy revealed an ulcer at the less curvature of the stomach, with biopsy pathology diagnosis as severe atypical hyperplasia, which was confirmed to be poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma by a second biopsy. In past medical history, the patient had 5 coronary stents implanted because of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease 3 years ago.\\nGastric cancer (cT4NxMx) according to the patient\\'s history and biopsy pathology.\\nthe patient was treated surgery-based multidisciplinary treatments integrating CRS\\u200a+\\u200aHIPEC and IP\\u200a+\\u200aIV adjuvant chemotherapy. The CRS was curative distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, and HIPEC was cisplatin 120\\u200amg plus mitomycin C 30\\u200amg at 43\\u200a°C, for 60\\u200aminutes. Final pathological diagnosis of after surgery was: poorly differentiate adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells, with invasion beyond the serosal layer and into the duodenum, 10/23 lymph nodes positive, nerve invasion, vascular tumor thrombi, Borrmann type IV, Lauren type diffuse. TNM stage was pT4aN3M0, IIIC. After operation, the patient received 6 courses of IV chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/Tegafur Gimeracil Oteracil Potassium capsules, and IP chemotherapy with docetaxel and carboplatin.\\nRegular follow-up till July 20, 2020, revealed that the patient has a disease-free survival of over 61+ months.\\nCRS\\u200a+\\u200aHIPEC combined with IP\\u200a+\\u200aIV chemotherapy achieved long-term disease-free survival for this patient with gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma and deserve further study. This new treatment modality deserves appropriate consideration in routine clinical practice for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Sedation esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has become more prevalent in many countries. However, owing to the limitation of health insurance payment for sedation EGD in Taiwan, non-sedation EGD still accounts for the majority of cases. This study was aimed to explore the differences between the sedation and non-sedation groups in terms of endoscopic findings, such as detection rate of gastric polyp of any size, number of detected gastric polyps, and location of the gastric polyps detected.We enrolled 10,940 patients who underwent EGD between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 at the Tri-Service General Hospital; among the patients, 1900 received intravenous sedation (IVS) and 9040 did not. The data reviewed included demographics, parameters of the polyp (number, size, and location), and pathology.Compared with the non-sedation group, the sedation group had a higher overall polyp detection rate (P\\u200a<\\u200a.001); a greater number of detected polyps (Odds ratio 1.50, P\\u200a=\\u200a.007); and a higher detection rate of smaller polyps, such as fundic gland polyp, and hyperplastic polyp (P\\u200a<\\u200a.001). Among the pathological findings, gastric neuroendocrine tumor (NET) was detected using EGD in 2 cases and manifested as small polyps (<0.05\\u200acm), and it showed significantly better detection rates in the sedation EGD group than in the non-sedation EGD group (P\\u200a=\\u200a.002).Sedation EGD could enhance a patients willingness and cooperation during EGD. Furthermore, sedation EGD increased the detection rates of small gastric polyps and was more likely to enable identification of unusual findings, such as gastric NET. Paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that are strongly influenced by genetics, and succinate dehydrogenase-deficient PGLs appear to constitute one of the most important categories. Interestingly, somatic PGLs only possess genomic alterations involving the SDHB and SDHD subunits, and no SDHA alterations have been described. Here, we are presenting the clinical and genetic analyses of 2 cases with the first somatic SDHA variant identified in PGLs.\\nHere, we reported 2 family members with the diagnosis of PGL. Patient 1 is a 55-year-old woman with a functionally perigastric PGL that co-occurred with a gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and patient 2 is a 43-year-old woman with a nonfunctionally pericardial PGL, who was the younger sister of the first patient.\\nImaging surveys of the 2 cases depicted the presence of a perigastric and a pericardial mass, respectively. A diagnosis of paragangliomas was established by immunohistochemistry (IHC).\\nBoth patients underwent single-stage resection of the lesion after preoperative oral α-adrenoceptor therapy for 2 weeks. We later performed comprehensive genomic profiling on the tumor samples, including PGL and GIST from patient 1 and PGL from patient 2, and searched for novel actionable mutations, including in all succinate dehydrogenase subunits, as the IHC results were negative for SDHB.\\nBoth patients had an uneventful recovery after surgery and the sequencing showed a novel somatic variant in the SDHA gene on chromosome 5q11 (c.1945_1946delTT). Regular follow-up with biochemical testing and image studies showed no evidence of recurrence after a year for patient 1 and 6 years for patient 2.\\nPGLs often lead to considerable diagnostic difficulty due to their multiple anatomical locations and variable symptoms, as presented by our cases. The comprehensive use of images and plasma/urine catecholamine measurement can aid the diagnosis of PGLs. In addition, our findings also demonstrate the usefulness and importance of genetic analysis of SDHA mutations in patients exhibiting SDHB IHC-negative PGL. Additional studies utilizing comprehensive genomic profiling are needed to identify the group of PGLs harboring this SDHA genomic alteration. This study will summarize the clinical significance of E-Cadherin and β-catenin in early gastric cancer (EGC).\\nEligible case-control studies were searched from Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, CBM, and CNKI from inception to the present. In addition, we will also search other sources to avoid missing potential studies. Two authors will independently carry out study selection, data collection, and study methodological quality. A fixed or random-effects model will be utilize to synthesize the data, and RevMan 5.3 software will be used for data analysis.\\nThis study will summarize all eligible studies to investigate the clinical significance of E-Cadherin and β-catenin in EGC.\\nThe findings of this study may present a genuine understanding of perspective on the clinical significance of E-Cadherin and β-catenin in EGC. We present a case of neuroendocrine tumor localized in the gastric mucosa, incidentally detected by F-choline PET/CT in a 69-year-old man with prostate cancer. F-choline PET/CT scan showed an increased activity in the stomach, later diagnosed as a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, at biopsy. A careful attention of reading F-choline PET/CT images should be made, in order to avoid the missing of potential concomitant neoplasia in patients with prostate cancer. ( Many studies have been conducted to determine the composition of the glycoconjugates of the mucus-secreting cells of the fundic glands of the stomach. However, the chief cells of these glands have been largely ignored because they secrete mainly zymogens with a lower glycosylation. The aim of this work was to analyze the glycoconjugates of the gastric chief cells by a battery of 17 different lectins, recognizing Fucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, Galactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetylglucosamine and Mannose containing oligosaccharides. Histochemical techniques were performed with several lectins and also combined with two pre-treatments; β-elimination, which removes O-linked oligosaccharides, and incubation with Peptide-N-Gycosidase F, which removes N-linked oligosaccharides. In addition, acid hydrolysis was performed before WGA histochemistry, and incubation with glucose oxidase before Con A labeling. Many lectins did not stain the chief cells. In addition, the presence of O-glycans in the apical cell membrane was demonstrated with the lectins AAL, HPA, MPA/MPL, PNA, RCA-I, and WGA. Some of these O-glycans were resistant to short-term β-elimination pre-treatments. Mannose-binding lectins stained the basal cytoplasm of the chief cells. The level of glycosylation of the chief cells was lower than that of the mucous cells. The presence of O-glycans in the apical cell membrane is consistent with the presence of mucins such as MUC1 in the apical membrane of chief cells. Moreover, Mannose-binding lectins revealed N-glycosylation in the basal cytoplasm. The knowledge of gastric chief cell glycoconjugates is relevant because of their potential involvement not only in in physiological but also in pathological processes, such as cancer. Some gastric epithelial neoplasms show predominant chief cell differentiation (oxyntic gland neoplasms), in which the entity of \"gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic gland type\" was firstly designated, whereas a possible more aggressive subgroup \"gastric adenocarcinoma of fundic gland mucosa type\" (GA-FGM) was subsequently proposed. However, the histopathologic progression mode of these neoplasms has not been sufficiently reported. In this article, we describe a case of GA-FGM in which we could observe its progression during 5 years. The tumor was removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection 5 years after the first biopsy, which had already shown a feature of oxyntic gland neoplasm. During the follow-up period, the endoscopy revealed little change in the tumor appearance. However, the histology of endoscopic submucosal dissection showed submucosal extension with its histological progression. Besides, other oxyntic gland neoplasms of the stomach were observed metachronously or synchronously, giving an implication about a common pathogenetic basis of these lesions. To describe the methodology of laparothoracoscopic Ivor Lewis esophagectomy in surgical treatment of esophageal cancer and compare early outcomes of this procedure with conventional Ivor Lewis surgery.\\nThere were 30 laparothoracoscopic Ivor Lewis esophagectomies followed by non-hardware esophageal-gastric intrapleural anastomosis for esophageal cancer. All procedures have been performed for the period 2016-2019 at the Moscow Regional Research and Clinical Institute (suturing of anastomosis was based on the method of professor A.S. Allakhverdyan).\\nLaparothoracoscopic esophagectomy is characterized by higher surgery time by 136.57 min (\\nEarly results of laparothoracoscopic Ivor Lewis esophagectomy are superior to the results of conventional Ivor Lewis surgery in surgical treatment of esophageal cancer.\\nПредставить подробное описание методики лапароторакоскопической эзофагэктомии по типу Ivor Lewis при хирургическом лечении рака пищевода и провести сравнительный анализ непосредственных результатов с традиционной операцией Ivor Lewis.\\nЗа период 2016—2019 гг. в ГБУЗ МО МОНИКИ им.

Measuring progress against cancer is more accurate when trends in incidence, survival, and mortality are interpreted simultaneously. Our study aims to analyze how these key metrics have evolved over time in the Azores, Portugal.\\nData for incident cases diagnosed in 1997-2016 and followed up through December 31, 2017 were obtained from the Azores Cancer Registry. Data for cancer deaths that occurred in 1991-2016 were obtained from Statistics Portugal. To estimate temporal trends, we applied a joinpoint model to age-adjusted rates. We estimated five-year net survival within the framework of relative survival using the Pohar-Perme estimator and predicted the number of cases and deaths in 2025.\\nIn men, incidence and mortality decreased for stomach, larynx, and prostate cancer. In women, mortality decreased for breast and cervical cancer. Five-year relative survival improved for several cancers, with the most pronounced improvements for prostate cancer in men and colorectal cancer in women (24.1 and 27.9 percentage point absolute increase, respectively). Conversely, incidence and mortality increased for colorectal cancer in men and lung cancer in women. The incidence and mortality burdens are both expected to increase in 2025.\\nOverall, progress against cancer in the Azores has been mixed, and much of the progress has been driven by advances in treatment. Statistics for lung cancer in women and colorectal cancer in men are a call to action for policymakers. Reducing tobacco use and tackling the obesity epidemic are the two public health priorities for cancer control within the region. To investigate the role of omeprazole and nitrites on the gastric mucosa of rats submitted to specific techniques to induce duodenogastric reflux.\\nOne hundred and twenty Wistar rats were divided into three groups: Group I (n=40) -gastrotomy; Group II (n=40) - duodenogastric reflux after gastrojejunoanastomosis latero-lateral (DGR); Group III (n=40) - retrograde duodenogastric reflux through the pylorus (DGR-P). The groups were divided into 4 subgroups of 10 animals, respectively treated for 16 weeks with water, omeprazole 1.6 mg / rat / day, nitrite 600 mg / kg / day and omeprazole plus nitrite simultaneously.\\nThe proliferative lesions found were: squamous hyperplasia - 69.1%, adenomatous hyperplasia in the anastomosis - 29.1% and prepyloric adenomatous hyperplasia - 42.5%. Adenocarcinomas were registered in 7 animals (5.8%): one in Group I (omeprazole plus nitrite), two in Group II (omeprazole and nitrite plus omeprazole) and four in Group III (water, nitrite, omeprazole and omeprazole plus nitrite).\\nThe occurrence of squamous hyperplasia, adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma increased after gastrojejunal anastomoses, which cause duodenogastric reflux. The association of omeprazole did not protect the development of proliferative lesions and cancer induced by duodenogastric reflux in rats. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is rare neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract associated with high rates of malignant transformation. GIST has been found largely in the stomach, small bowel, colon and rectum, and esophagus, but about 5% are found in other locations. We herein report a 56-year-old woman with a GIST in perforated Meckel\\'s diverticulum. After encountering this patient, a review of the literature found reports of 18 similar patients.\\nA 56-year-old woman diagnosed with galactosialidosis (β-galactosidase-neuraminidase deficiency) presented with vomiting. On contrast-enhanced computed tomography, peritonitis due to perforation of the intestine was diagnosed based on the free air and dilated loop of the small bowel. Laparotomy revealed perforation of Meckel\\'s diverticulitis located 50\\xa0cm from the ileocecal valve. Partial resection of the ileum, including the diverticulum, and end-to-end anastomosis of the small intestine were performed. Regarding the pathological findings, the edge of the diverticulum wall consisted of a solid mass measuring 1.0\\xa0cm in size, and the tumor cells were spindle-shaped with 1 mitosis present per 50 high-power fields. The diagnosis was established as GIST of the Meckel\\'s diverticulum. The postoperative period was uneventful. Follow-up at two years revealed no evidence of recurrence.\\nGIST in perforated Meckel\\'s diverticulum is very rare. The potential for the coexistence of GIST or other tumor should be considered in the treatment of perforated Meckel\\'s diverticulum. White globe appearance has recently been identified as a novel endoscopic marker useful in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer. Recently, this lesion has also been reported in the noncancerous stomach, including cases with autoimmune atrophic gastritis, although the clinical significance remains unclear. We present the details of a 68-year-old woman who began vonoprazan therapy for severe gastroesophageal reflux disease causing esophageal stricture. On follow-up endoscopy 1\\xa0year after beginning vonoprazan, multiple white globe appearance lesions developed in all sections of her stomach, except for the antrum. We also detected lesions during a yearly follow-up in the noncancerous stomach of a 70-year-old man who had received vonoprazan for 3\\xa0years. Lesions in both cases constituted cystic gland dilatations containing eosinophilic material. There was no evidence of accompanying autoimmune atrophic gastritis in either patient. This report is the first to our knowledge describing newly developed white globe appearance lesions in the noncancerous stomach during follow-up in two cases who received vonoprazan. Our findings suggest that these lesions in the noncancerous stomach might be associated with vonoprazan treatment. We investigated the two cases endoscopically and histologically, and we report our findings with a literature review. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis is one of the most common imaging studies ordered through the emergency department (ED). Because these studies are ordered for the detection of acute abnormalities and due to the relatively low incidence in patients presenting through the ED, gastrointestinal tumors are commonly missed. Moreover, many CT findings of malignant tumors overlap with benign entities, which can present a diagnostic challenge. This review article will describe the common CT findings of gastric, small bowel, colon, and appendiceal cancer as well as some of the common benign gastrointestinal conditions with similar imaging findings. The standard treatment for stage IB gastric cancer is curative surgery alone, but some patients show poor survival with disease recurrence after curative surgery. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors of recurrence and long-term survival in patients with stage IB gastric cancer after surgery.\\nWe retrospectively reviewed data from 253 patients with stage IB gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy between 2011 and 2016 at Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital and analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics associated with recurrence and survival.\\nFourteen patients experienced recurrence with a mean follow-up of 54.1 months. Two of these patients had locoregional recurrence and 12 patients had systemic recurrence. The median interval between the operation day and the day of recurrence was 11 months (range 4-56 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) (hazard ratio [HR], 3.851; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.264-11.732) and the elderly (age≥65) (HR, 3.850; 95% CI, 1.157-12.809) were independent risk factors for recurrence after surgery. The LVI (HR, 3.630; 95% CI, 1.105-11.923) was the independent prognostic factors for disease-specific survival (DSS). The 5-year DSS rates were 96.8% in patients who did not have LVI, and 89.3% in patients who had LVI.\\nThis study shows that LVI was associated with recurrence and poor survival in patients with stage IB gastric cancer after curative gastrectomy. Patients diagnosed with LVI require careful attention for systemic recurrence during the follow-up period. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of intracorporeal overlapping gastrogastrostomy between the proximal anterior wall and antrum posterior wall (PAAP; PAAP anastomosis) of the stomach in minimally invasive pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) for early gastric cancer (EGC).\\nFrom December 2016 to December 2019, 17 patients underwent minimally invasive PPG with PAAP anastomosis for EGC in the high body and posterior wall of the stomach. Intraoperative gastroscopy was performed with the rotation maneuver during proximal transection. A longer antral cuff (>4-5 cm) was created for PAAP than for conventional PPG (≤3 cm) at the point where a safe distal margin and good vascular perfusion were secured. Because the posterior wall of the proximal remnant stomach was insufficient for intracorporeal anastomosis, the anterior wall was used to create an overlapping anastomosis with the posterior wall of the remnant antrum. The surgical and oncological outcomes were analyzed, and the stomach volume was measured in patients who completed the 6-month follow-up. The results were compared to those after conventional PPG (n=11 each).\\nPAAP anastomosis was successfully performed in 17 patients. The proximal and distal resection margins were 2.4±1.9 cm and 4.0±2.6 cm, respectively. No postoperative complications were observed during the 1-year follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy (n=10). The postoperative remnant stomach (n=11) was significantly larger with PAAP than with conventional PPG (225.6±118.3 vs. 99.1±63.2 mL; P=0.001). The stomach length from the anastomosis to the pylorus was 4.9±2.4 cm after PAAP.\\nPAAP anastomosis is a feasible alternative for intracorporeal anastomosis in minimally invasive PPG for highly posteriorly located EGC. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) risk calculator is useful in predicting postoperative adverse events. However, its accuracy in specific disorders is unclear. We validated the ACS NSQIP risk calculator in patients with gastric cancer undergoing curative laparoscopic surgery.\\nWe included 207 consecutive early gastric cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy between January 2018 and January 2019. The preoperative characteristics and risks of the patients were reviewed and entered into the ACS NSQIP calculator. The estimated risks of postoperative outcomes were compared with the observed outcomes using C-statistics and Brier scores.\\nMost of the patients underwent distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (74.4%). We did not observe any cases of mortality, venous thromboembolism, urinary tract infection, renal failure, or cardiac complications. The other outcomes assessed were complications such as pneumonia, surgical site infections, any complications requiring re-operation or hospital readmission, the rates of discharge to nursing homes/rehabilitation centers, and the length of stay. All C-statistics were <0 and the highest was for pneumonia (0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.71). Brier scores ranged from 0.01 for pneumonia to 0.155 for other complications. Overall, the risk calculator was inconsistent in predicting the outcomes.\\nThe ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator showed low predictive ability for postoperative adverse events after laparoscopic gastrectomy for patients with early gastric cancer. Further research to adjust the risk calculator for these patients may improve its predictive ability. Recently, non-exposure simple suturing endoscopic full-thickness resection (NESS-EFTR) was developed to prevent tumor exposure to the peritoneal cavity. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of NESS-EFTR with sentinel basin dissection for early gastric cancer (EGC).\\nThis was the prospective SENORITA 3 pilot. From July 2017 to January 2018, 20 patients with EGC smaller than 3 cm without an absolute indication for endoscopic submucosal dissection were enrolled. The sentinel basin was detected using Tc\\nAmong the 20 enrolled patients, one dropped out due to large tumor size, while another underwent conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy due to metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. All NESS-EFTR procedures were performed in 17 of the 18 other patients (94.4%) without conversion, and the complete resection rate was 83.3% (15/18). The intraoperative perforation rate was 27.8% (5/18), and endoscopic clipping or laparoscopic suturing or stapling was performed at the perforation site. There was one case of postoperative complications treated with endoscopic clipping; the others were discharged without any event.\\nNESS-EFTR with sentinel basin dissection is a technically challenging procedure that obtains safe margins, prevents intraoperative perforation, and may be a treatment option for EGC after additional experience.\\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03216174. Endoscopic vacuum-assisted closure (EVAC) has been attempted as new nonsurgical treatment for anastomotic leakage. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of EVAC and compare its efficacy with the self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) for postgastrectomy leakage.\\nBetween January 2007 and February 2018, 39 patients underwent endoscopic treatment for anastomotic leakage after gastric cancer surgery. Of them, 28 patients were treated with SEMS, seven with EVAC after SEMS failure, and four with EVAC. We retrospectively compared the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes between EVAC (n=11) and SEMS (n=28).\\nThe median followup duration was 17 months (interquartile range, 9 to 26 months) in both groups. In comparison of clinical characteristics between two groups, only the median size of the leak was larger in the EVAC group than in the SEMS group (2.1 cm vs 1.0 cm; p<0.001). All EVAC cases healed successfully; however, two cases (7.1%) failed to heal in the SEMS group. Anastomotic stricture occurred one case (9.1%) in EVAC and four cases (14.3%) in SEMS within 1 year after endoscopic treatment. The median treatment duration of EVAC was shorter than that of SEMS (15 days vs 36 days; p<0.001). Median weight loss after therapy was similar in both groups (8.0 kg in EVAC vs 9.0 kg in SEMS; p=0.356).\\nEVAC can be effective endoscopic treatment for postgastrectomy anastomotic leakage. Substantial leakage could be an important clinical factor for considering EVAC as a treatment option. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of EVAC. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacterium that chronically infects approximately 50% of the world\\'s human population. While in most cases the infection remains asymptomatic, 10% of infected individuals develop gastric pathologies and 1-3% progress to gastric cancer. Although H. pylori induces severe inflammatory responses, the host\\'s immune system fails to clear the pathogen and H. pylori can persist in the human stomach for decades. As suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are important feedback regulators limiting inflammatory responses, we hypothesized that H. pylori could modulate the host\\'s immune responses by inducing SOCS expression.\\nThe phenotype of human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) infected with H. pylori was analyzed by flow cytometry and multiplex technology. SOCS expression levels were monitored by qPCR and signaling studies were conducted by means of Western blot. For functional studies, RNA interference-based silencing of SOCS1-3 and co-cultures with CD4\\nWe show that H. pylori positive gastritis patients express significantly higher SOCS3, but not SOCS1 and SOCS2, levels compared to H. pylori negative patients. Moreover, infection of human moDCs with H. pylori rapidly induces SOCS3 expression, which requires the type IV secretion system (T4SS), release of TNFα, and signaling via the MAP kinase p38, but appears to be independent of TLR2, TLR4, MEK1/2 and STAT proteins. Silencing of SOCS3 expression in moDCs prior to H. pylori infection resulted in increased release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of PD-L1, and decreased T-cell proliferation.\\nThis study shows that H. pylori induces SOCS3 via an autocrine loop involving the T4SS and TNFα and p38 signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate that high levels of SOCS3 in DCs dampen PD-L1 expression on DCs, which in turn drives T-cell proliferation. Video Abstract. Coffee is the second most popular drink worldwide, and it has various components with antioxidant and antitumor properties. Due to its chemical composition, it could act as an antitumor substance in the gastrointestinal tract. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between coffee consumption and the incidence/mortality of stomach cancer in the highest-consuming countries. An ecological study using Spearman\\'s correlation coefficient was performed. The WorldAtlas\\'s dataset of coffee consumption and the incidence/mortality rates database of the International Agency for Research were used as sources of information. A total of 25 countries were entered to the study. There was an inverse linear correlation between coffee consumption in kg per person per year and estimated age-adjusted incidence (  Up to 22% of all gastric adenocarcinomas are of the microsatellite instability (MSI) subtype. This subtype may not benefit from conventional adjuvant chemotherapy but does respond to novel immunotherapies. A proportion of MSI gastric adenocarcinomas are associated with inherited disease, inferring an opportunity to screen for further cancers in the patient while also identifying at-risk relatives. Although the importance of MSI subtyping is clear, the methods of detection vary. The main techniques are MSI testing and mismatch repair (MMR) immunohistochemistry (IHC). This study compares a novel Idylla (Biocartis) MSI assay to MMR IHC across 50 biopsies of gastric adenocarcinoma. The methods were concordant across 48 cases. The two discrepant results demonstrated known difficulties in the interpretation of IHC. Idylla MSI testing presents several advantages over MMR IHC but both methods are well established in detecting this subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma. The methods are best regarded as complementary tests, performing most optimally when combined. Angiosarcoma is a highly invasive tumour with a low incidence rate but high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis and a poor prognosis. Understanding the endoscopic characteristics of angiosarcoma will help with early diagnosis and treatment of this disease.\\nThe patient was a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital due to recurring melena for 3\\u200amonths. Outpatient gastroscopy showed that the patient had multiple gastric erosions. Colonoscopy revealed the presence of multiple protruding lesions in the colon and multiple rectal polyps. Pathological biopsy indicated that the patient had a tubular adenoma, which was removed by endoscopic resection.\\nPostsurgical pathologic assessment suggested that the histological subtype was epithelioid angiosarcoma. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) revealed multiple metastases in the lymph nodes and bone.\\nThe patient underwent acid suppression to protect the stomach, fluid supplementation and red blood cell infusion, and subsequently, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were recommended. The patient\\'s family refused further treatments for the patient and requested discharge.\\nThe patient refused further treatment and was not followed-up.\\nColorectal angiosarcoma is an extremely rare and highly malignant tumour, and understanding its endoscopic morphology will help aid in its diagnosis. This prospective multicenter non-randomized phase III study aims to evaluate the long-term outcome of sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer compared with conventional distal or total gastrectomy. Clinically diagnosed primary T1N0M0 gastric cancer patients with a single lesion (≤40\\xa0mm) and without previous endoscopic treatment will be enrolled in this study. Sentinel nodes are identified by dye and radioisotope tracers and are subjected to intraoperative rapid pathology. For patients with negative sentinel node metastasis, individualized surgery consisting of limited stomach resection and sentinel node basin dissection is performed, while standard gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection is employed for the positive sentinel node patients. A total of 225 patients will be accrued from 13 hospitals that have experience in sentinel node mapping. The primary endpoint is 5-year relapse-free survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival, sentinel node detection rate, diagnostic accuracy for sentinel node, distribution of sentinel nodes and metastatic sentinel node/non-sentinel node, and postoperative quality of life.   Objective Historically, patients have fasted before elective surgery to ensure an empty stomach to avoid aspiration. A fasting-induced catabolic state however may adversely influence recovery after surgery. Our study was designed to test the effect of oral carbohydrate loading on clinical parameters in patients undergoing major surgery for advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Methods A double-blinded single-centre randomised trial was designed to recruit 110 patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer undergoing either primary surgery, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to debulking surgery. Following written informed consent, the patients were randomised into two groups. Group 1 received the carbohydrate drink (intervention) and group 2 received flavoured water (placebo). The quantity of fluid in both groups was 800ml the night before the surgery and 400ml two hours before the induction of anaesthesia. The primary endpoint of the study was the Length of Hospital Stay (LoHS); the secondary parameters assessed were pain scores, nausea and vomiting scores, bowel function, and postoperative complication rate. Results Between March 2009 and December 2011, 80 patients were randomised and 75 completed the study. A decision was made to close the trial early as a change in routine clinical practice meant that patients were admitted on the day of surgery rather than a day before. Analysis of the data revealed that there were no significant differences between the study groups in terms of LoHS and other clinical parameters. Conclusion In this single-center study, which failed to recruit the planned number of patients, we were unable to demonstrate that oral carbohydrate intake pre-operatively has significant impact on the recovery process or the length of hospitalisation postoperatively. Future studies should examine all aspects of an Enhanced Recovery Program after Surgery as a package as compared to a single element to enhance patient outcome. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor representing more than 90% of primary liver cancer. This study aimed to identify metabolism-related biomarkers with prognostic value by developing the novel prognostic score (PS) model. Transcriptomic profiles derived from TCGA and EBIArray databases were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HCC tumor samples compared with normal samples. The overlapped genes between DEGs and metabolism-related genes (crucial genes) were screened and functionally analyzed. A novel PS model was constructed to identify optimal signature genes. Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent clinical factors related to prognosis. Nomogram model was constructed to estimate the predictability of clinical factors. Finally, protein expression of crucial genes was explored in different cancer tissues and cell types from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). We screened a total of 305 overlapped genes (differentially expressed metabolism-related genes). These genes were mainly involved in \"oxidation reduction,\" \"steroid hormone biosynthesis,\" \"fatty acid metabolic process,\" and \"linoleic acid metabolism.\" Furthermore, we screened ten optimal DEGs (CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and TKT, among others) by using the PS model. Two clinical factors of pathologic stage (P < .001, HR: 1.512 [1.219-1.875]) and PS status (P <.001, HR: 2.259 [1.522-3.354]) were independent prognostic predictors by cox regression analysis. Nomogram model showed a high predicted probability of overall survival time, and the AUC value was 0.837. The expression status of 7 proteins was frequently altered in normal or differential tumor tissues, such as liver cancer and stomach cancer samples.We have identified several metabolism-related biomarkers for prognosis prediction of HCC based on the PS model. Two clinical factors were independent prognostic predictors of pathologic stage and PS status (high/low risk). The prognosis prediction model described in this study is a useful and stable method for novel biomarker identification. GISTs are rare tumours of the GI tract arising from the intestinal cells of Cajal. Though various risk stratification systems have been proposed, none has been universally accepted. We audited the survival and recurrence patterns in our patients and evaluated clinicopathological features to identify prognostic factors affecting survival. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients treated at our hospital from 1999 to 2012. Patient variables, clinicopathological factors and treatment variables were collected. Sixty-three patients were evaluated and treated at our institute of which 38 were non-metastatic. The most common site of origin was the stomach. On univariate analysis, presence of metastasis, male gender, high mitotic rate, non-gastric primary and epithelioid histology were significantly associated with poor overall survival. Tumour size >\\u200910\\xa0cm, mitotic rate >\\u200910/50\\xa0hpf and presence of necrosis significantly affected disease-free survival for non-metastatic patients. Multivariate analysis showed higher mitotic rate and non-gastric primary to correlate with worse outcome. In our experience, a high mitotic rate and non-gastric primary independently predicted a poor prognosis in GIST. Gallbladder involvement in lymphoma is extremely rare, and only 68 cases have been reported in the English literature so far. We experienced a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the gallbladder arising 8 years after DLBCL of the right testis.\\nA 68-year-old man underwent orchiectomy for malignant lymphoma of the right testis pathologically diagnosed as DLBCL 8 years ago. Systemic surveillance incidentally revealed a gallbladder tumour, and elective resection of the gallbladder bed of the liver was performed under a preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder cancer. The histopathological examination revealed DLBCL. At re-evaluation 3 months after surgery, he was diagnosed as having DLBCL involving the stomach. There had been no recurrence for 39 months after chemotherapy and radiation, but he suffered from a poor general condition due to protein-losing enteropathy and died of infection.\\nWe compiled and analysed reported cases of malignant lymphomas involving the gallbladder in terms of background, symptoms, imaging findings, and prognosis. Compared to MALT lymphoma, DLBCL was significantly more involved in other organs simultaneously or heterochronously (p = 0.004).\\nGallbladder lymphoma should be added to the differential diagnosis of gallbladder tumours, especially when clinical findings are not consistent with the typical course of gallbladder carcinoma and cholecystitis. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Patients with cancer are more likely to incur poor clinical outcomes. Due to the prevailing pandemic, we propose some surgical strategies for gastric cancer patients.\\nThe \\'COVID-19\\' period was defined as occurring between 2020 and 01-20 and 2020-03-20. The enrolled patients were divided into two groups, pre-COVID-19 group (PCG) and COVID-19 group (CG). A total of 109 patients with gastric cancer were enrolled in this study.\\nThe waiting time before admission increased by 4\\u2009days in the CG (PCG: 4.5 [IQR: 2, 7.8] vs. CG: 8.0 [IQR: 2,20]; p\\u2009=\\u20090.006). More patients had performed chest CT scans besides abdominal CT before admission during the COVID-19 period (PCG: 22 [32%] vs. CG: 30 [73%], p\\u2009=\\u20090.001). After admission during the COVID period, the waiting time before surgery was longer (PCG: 3[IQR: 2,5] vs. CG: 7[IQR: 5,9]; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), more laparoscopic surgeries were performed (PCG: 51[75%] vs. CG: 38[92%], p\\u2009=\\u20090.021), and hospital stay period after surgery was longer (7[IQR: 6,8] vs.9[IQR:7,11]; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In addition, the total cost of hospitalization increased during this period, (PCG: 9.22[IQR:7.82,10.97] vs. CG: 10.42[IQR:8.99,12.57]; p\\u2009=\\u20090.006).\\nThis study provides an opportunity for our surgical colleagues to reflect on their own services and any contingency plans they may have to tackle the COVID-19 crisis. Proximal gastrectomy (PG) is one of the function-preserving surgical methods for the treatment of upper gastric cancer. Favorable postoperative results have been reported in comparison with total gastrectomy. However, because there are challenges, such as postoperative reflux esophagitis, anastomotic stenosis, and residual food, appropriate selection of a reconstruction method is crucial. Some methods include esophagogastric anastomosis, including simple esophagogastrostomy, tube-like stomach esophagogastrostomy, side overlap with fundoplication by Yamashita, and double-flap technique, and reconstruction using the small intestine, including double-tract methods, jejunal interposition, and jejunal pouch interposition. However, standard reconstruction methods are yet to be established. PG has also been employed in early gastric cancer of the upper third of the stomach, and indications have also been extended to esophagogastric junction cancer, which has shown an increase in recent years. Although many retrospective studies have revealed the functional benefits or oncological safety of PG, the characteristics of each surgical procedure should be understood so that an appropriate reconstruction method, with a reflux prevention mechanism and minimal postoperative injury, can be selected. Venous (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE) are frequent complications of cancer. Risk assessment models (RAM) for stratification of the thrombotic risk in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer have several limitations.\\nWhile pancreatic and stomach cancer are considered very high risk in all RAM, the risk of colorectal cancer differs between RAM, and esophageal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma were underrepresented or not included in any RAM. In addition, up to 49% of patients with pancreatic cancer develop splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). Prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) in ambulatory cancer patients is associated with a positive risk-benefit ratio only in high-risk patients and LMWH have been the standard of care for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE and SVT over the last years. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been shown to be equally effective compared to LMWH, but bleedings from the GI tract are more frequent. Therefore, recent guidelines suggest the use of DOAC for VTE treatment and for prophylaxis in ambulatory patients at high risk for VTE, but patients at high risk for bleeding, especially with active luminal cancer, should receive LMWH.\\nThis review discusses RAM and the current options for prophylaxis and treatment of cancer-associated ATE, VTE, and SVT focusing on GI cancers. Distant metastases from breast cancer are frequently found in bones, lungs and the liver. Metastasis to the stomach is rare, and its clinical presentation remains unclear. The present report describes a case of isolated gastric metastasis from breast cancer identified by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). A 45-year-old female patient underwent right mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection after preoperative chemotherapy for right invasive lobular breast carcinoma T4bN2M0, stage IIIB. Postoperative radiotherapy and endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years were performed. CT for postoperative follow-up at 52 years old revealed thickening of the stomach wall. Although the patient was asymptomatic, erosive mucosa was observed on the gastric body during gastroscopy. The gastric lesion was immunohistochemically diagnosed as metastatic luminal disease from the breast cancer. Positron emission tomography/CT revealed no abnormal accumulation suggesting metastasis to other organs. Palbociclib and fulvestrant treatment were initiated for gastric metastasis. Invasive lobular breast carcinoma results in gastrointestinal metastasis, including the stomach, more frequently than invasive ductal breast carcinoma. However, most gastric metastases occur simultaneously with systemic metastases. Solitary metastasis to the stomach without symptoms as in this case has rarely been reported. The possibility of gastric metastasis should be considered among the differential diagnoses, even in the absence of symptoms, when gastrointestinal abnormalities are seen on CT in patients with a history of breast cancer. Gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of the most aggressive primary digestive cancers. It has unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes and is difficult to diagnose early.\\nTo identify prognostic biomarkers for GC patients using comprehensive bioinformatics analyses.\\nDifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases for GC. Overlapping DEGs were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. A risk score model was then constructed and its prognostic value was validated utilizing an independent Gene Expression Omnibus dataset (GSE15459). Multiple databases were used to analyze each gene in the risk score model. High-risk score-associated pathways and therapeutic small molecule drugs were analyzed and predicted, respectively.\\nA total of 95 overlapping DEGs were found and a nine-gene signature (\\nThe nine-gene signature-derived risk score allows to predict GC prognosis and might prove useful for guiding therapeutic strategies for GC patients. Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with poor prognosis. It remains unclear whether the prognosis is associated with somatic gene mutations.\\nIn this research, we collected two independent STAD cohorts with both genetic profiling and clinical follow-up data, systematically investigated the association between the prognosis and somatic mutations, and analyzed the influence of heterogeneity on the prognosis-genetics association.\\nTypical association was identified between somatic mutations and overall prognosis for individual cohorts. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, a list of 24 genes was also identified that tended to mutate within cases of the poorest prognosis. The association showed apparent heterogeneity between different cohorts, although common signatures could be identified. A machine-learning model was trained with 20 common genes that showed a similar mutation rate difference between prognostic groups in the two cohorts, and it classified the cases in each cohort into two groups with significantly different prognosis. The model outperformed both single-gene models and TNM-based staging system significantly.\\nThe study made a systematic analysis on the association between STAD prognosis and somatic mutations, identified signature genes that showed mutation preference in different prognostic groups, and developed an effective multi-gene model that can effectively predict the overall prognosis of STAD in different cohorts. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is frequently detected in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) and matching metastasis, and has been linked to a worse prognosis. We investigated the presence of F. nucleatum in gastric cancer (GC) and gastric preneoplastic conditions of the stomach, and its potential prognostic value in GC patients. Fusobacterium spp. and F. nucleatum were quantified in various specimens from gastrointestinal tract including paired CRC and GC tissues using probe-based qPCR. Fusobacterium spp. and F. nucleatum were more frequently found in tumorous tissue of CRC and GC compared to non-tumorous tissues. The frequency and bacterial load were higher in CRC compared to GC patients. F. nucleatum positivity showed no association to chronic gastritis or preneoplastic conditions such as intestinal metaplasia. F. nucleatum-positivity was associated with significantly worse overall survival in patients with Lauren\\'s diffuse type, but not with intestinal type GC. There was no association with gender, Helicobacter pylori-status, tumor stage or tumor localization. However, F. nucleatum was positively associated with patient\\'s age and a trend for a lower global long interspersed element-1 DNA methylation. In conclusion, our work provides novel evidence for clinical relevance of F. nucleatum in GC by showing an association between F. nucleatum positivity with worse prognosis of patients with Laurens\\'s diffuse type gastric cancer. Further studies are necessary to explore related mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic benefit of targeted antibiotic treatment in GC patients. Gastric cancer (GC), which includes cancer of the esophagus, the oesophagogastric junction, and the stomach fundus, is highly deadly with strong regional influence, Asia being the most affected. GC is often detected at late stages, with 30% of metastatic cases at diagnosis. Many authors have devised models to both unravel the mechanisms of GC development and to evaluate candidate therapeutics. Among these models, 2D-cell cultures are progressively replaced by 3D-cell cultures that recapitulate, much more comprehensively, tumor cellular and genetic heterogeneity, as well as responsiveness to environmental changes, such as exposure to drugs or irradiation. With respect to the specifics of GC, there are high hopes from such model systems, especially with the aim of identifying prognostic markers and novel drug targets. Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) sometimes appears as multiple gastric cancer lesions. Here, we report a case of robot-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy (RTG) for a relatively rare disease with four synchronized lesions in EBVaGC and discuss the usefulness of robotic gastrectomy.\\nA 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with multiple gastric cancer because she had five lesions in the stomach and biopsy showed the presence of adenocarcinoma in four of the five lesions. We performed robot-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy on the patient. The histopathological diagnosis was multiple gastric cancer T1bN0M0 pStage IA. The four lesions were positive for the Epstein-Barr virus encoding region in in-situ hybridization and were considered to be EBVaGC. The patient had no sign of recurrence without postoperative therapy for 24 months.\\nEBVaGC was found in about 10% of all gastric cancer cases worldwide. EBVaGC sometimes appears as multiple gastric cancer, suggesting that EBV infection is closely related to the early stages of tumor formation. Total gastrectomy may be necessary for multiple gastric cancer such as EBVaGC, and robotic surgery is useful in total gastrectomy in terms of high-resolution three-dimensional images and using forceps with multi-joint functions.\\nWe performed RTG on a patient with four synchronous lesions of EBVaGC, which is relatively rare. Robot-assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy is known to be a safe procedure, and we effectively performed total gastrectomy for multiple EBVaGC. Genetic variants and lifestyle factors have been associated with gastric cancer risk, but the extent to which an increased genetic risk can be offset by a healthy lifestyle remains unknown. We aimed to establish a genetic risk model for gastric cancer and assess the benefits of adhering to a healthy lifestyle in individuals with a high genetic risk.\\nIn this meta-analysis and prospective cohort study, we first did a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the association between genetic variants and gastric cancer in six independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with a case-control study design. These GWAS comprised 21\\u2008168 Han Chinese individuals, of whom 10\\u2008254 had gastric cancer and 10\\u2008914 geographically matched controls did not. Using summary statistics from the meta-analysis, we constructed five polygenic risk scores in a range of thresholds (p=5\\u2008×\\u200810\\nThe polygenic risk score derived from 112 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (p<5\\u2008×\\u200810\\nChinese individuals at an increased risk of incident gastric cancer could be identified by use of our newly developed polygenic risk score. Compared with individuals at a high genetic risk who adopt an unhealthy lifestyle, those who adopt a healthy lifestyle could substantially reduce their risk of incident gastric cancer.\\nNational Key R&D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, 333 High-Level Talents Cultivation Project of Jiangsu Province, and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation. None Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a\\xa0rare noninherited condition characterized by gastrointestinal polyposis, alopecia, onychodystrophy, hyperpigmentation, weight loss and diarrhea. We report the case of an 80-year-old patient presenting with weight loss, diarrhea and dystrophic changes of the fingernails. The symptoms began 3 months prior to the admission. In the outpatient area an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and a\\xa0coloscopy had already been performed, showing a\\xa0polyposis of the stomach and an unclear generalized colitis. The admission was due to a\\xa0progressive worsening of the patient\\'s physical condition including further weight loss. The endoscopy showed an unusual continuous ileopancolitis as well as a\\xa0polyposis of the stomach. The histological examination revealed hyperplastic polyps with a\\xa0marked stromal edema. Together with the ectodermal changes a\\xa0CCS was diagnosed and treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous nutrition and proton pump inhibitors was initiated. In the further course of the hospital stay a\\xa0moderately reduced left ventricular function was diagnosed and the patient had to be temporarily monitored in the intensive care unit due to a\\xa0prolonged QTc time. In the follow-up 3 months later the patient showed good clinical and endoscopic response to the treatment with cessation of the diarrhea, weight gain of 8\\u202fkg and regrowth of the fingernails and head hair; however, the left ventricular function remained moderately impaired. to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Huachansu (HCS) injection plus chemotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer.\\nA thorough and systematic retrieval of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning HCS injection for treating gastric cancer was conducted in several electronic databases from inception to May 10, 2018. The quality of the RCTs was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. And the data about objective remission rate, performance status, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and other outcomes were extracted and analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 13.0 software.\\nA total of 14 RCTs with 976 participants were involved in the current Meta-analysis. The results suggested that HCS injection combined with chemotherapy was associated with better effects than receiving conventional chemotherapy alone in respect of improving the objective response rate [RR = 1.18, 95% CI (1.03, 1.37), Z = 2.32, P = 0.02], and performance status [RR = 1.84,95% CI (1.43, 2.36), Z = 4.74, P < 0.000 01]. In addition, HCS injection combined with chemotherapy could relieve pain for patients with gastric cancer.\\nThis Meta-analysis revealed that HCS injection plus chemotherapy might more effective than chemotherapy in treating gastric cancer. Nevertheless, more large-scale and rigorously designed RCTs should be performed to validate this finding. Cancer mortality is higher in counties with high levels of (current) poverty, but less is known about associations with persistent poverty. Persistent poverty counties (with ≥20% of residents in poverty since 1980) face social, structural, and behavioral challenges that may make their residents more vulnerable to cancer.\\nWe calculated 2007 to 2011 county-level, age-adjusted, and overall and type-specific cancer mortality rates (deaths/100,000 people/year) by persistent poverty classifications, which we contrasted with mortality in counties experiencing current poverty (≥20% of residents in poverty according to 2007-2011 American Community Survey). We used two-sample \\nOverall cancer mortality was 179.3 [standard error (SE) = 0.55] deaths/100,000 people/year in nonpersistent poverty counties and 201.3 (SE = 1.80) in persistent poverty counties (12.3% higher, \\nCancer mortality was higher in persistent poverty counties than other counties, including those experiencing current poverty.\\nEtiologic research and interventions, including policies, are needed to address multilevel determinants of cancer disparities in persistent poverty counties. We report a rare case of undifferentiated-type intramucosal gastric cancer that occurred in the fornix of the stomach without Helicobacter pylori infection, which consisted mainly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A 49-year-old man visited our hospital for a follow-up endoscopic examination of a small depressed lesion of the gastric fornix detected by surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy. On magnifying endoscopy with blue laser imaging, the depressed lesion (approximately 10\\xa0mm in diameter) was regarded as undifferentiated-type early gastric cancer that proved to be a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma by histological examination of biopsied specimens. The cancerous lesion was successfully treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection and microscopically showed an intramucosal cancer that invaded the whole mucosal layer with predominant growth of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma component. The patient status was verified as Helicobacter pylori-naïve according to the strict diagnostic criteria, thereby confirming this case as an undifferentiated-type Helicobacter pylori-uninfected gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori-uninfected intramucosal poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma occurring in the gastric fornix has not been previously reported. In Japan, a high-sodium diet is the most important dietary risk factor and is known to cause a range of health problems. This study aimed to forecast Japan\\'s disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) for chronic diseases that would be associated with high-sodium diet in different future scenarios of salt intake. We modelled DALY forecast and alternative future scenarios of salt intake for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), and stomach cancer (SC) from 2017 to 2040.\\nWe developed a three-component model of disease-specific DALYs: a component on the changes in major behavioural and metabolic risk predictors including salt intake; a component on the income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate under 25\\u2009years; and an autoregressive integrated moving average model to capture the unexplained component correlated over time. Data on risk predictors were obtained from Japan\\'s National Health and Nutrition Surveys and from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. To generate a reference forecast of disease-specific DALY rates for 2017-2040, we modelled the three diseases using the data for 1990-2016. Additionally, we generated better, moderate, and worse scenarios to evaluate the impact of change in salt intake on the DALY rate for the diseases.\\nIn our reference forecast, the DALY rates across all ages were predicted to be stable for CVDs, continuously increasing for CKDs, and continuously decreasing for SC. Meanwhile, the age group-specific DALY rates for these three diseases were forecasted to decrease, with some exceptions. Except for the ≥70 age group, there were remarkable differences in DALY rates between scenarios, with the best scenario having the lowest DALY rates in 2040 for SC. This represents a wide scope of future trajectories by 2040 with a potential for tremendous decrease in SC burden.\\nThe gap between scenarios provides some quantification of the range of policy impacts on future trajectories of salt intake. Even though we do not yet know the policy mix used to achieve these scenarios, the result that there can be differences between scenarios means that policies today can have a significant impact on the future DALYs.

This retrospective study analyzed 51 patients (range, 19 to 82\\u2009y) diagnosed from 2016 to 2019 and treated for DH/THL (n=34 MYC/BCL6 DHL, n=14 MYC/BCL2 DHL, n=3 THL) at one institution in South China. Extranodal lesions occurred in 32 patients (62.7%), more frequently in MYC/BCL6 DHL (22/34, 64.7%) than in MYC/BCL2 DHL (7/14, 50%). The most common extranodal sites were the stomach (8/32, 25.0%) and intestine (5/32, 15.6%). Most patients (33/45, 73.3%) presented with Ann Arbor stage III/IV. Interestingly, 14.3% (4/28) of MYC/BCL6 DHL tumors showed diffuse, medium-intensity CD30 expression. Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA was positive in 3 cases, all MYC/BCL6 DHL. Among 48 patients (94.1%) with follow-up data, 18 (37.5%) died owing to the disease, and the median survival was 5.5 months. Germinal center B cells were observed more frequently in MYC/BCL2 DHL (14/14, 100.0%) than in MYC/BCL6 DHL (15/34, 44.1%; P<0.001). Bone marrow involvement tended to lower overall survival (OS) (P=0.033). No association was observed between stage, B symptoms, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and central nervous system involvement and OS. A total of 25 patients (25/47, 53.2%) with previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections had significantly poorer OS (P=0.014). Chronic HBV infection was positively correlated with MYC/BCL6 DHL (r=0.317, P=0.030). Compared with DH/THL in western countries, the disease in South China has distinct characteristics with a higher prevalence of MYC/BCL6 DHL. We speculate that HBV is important in DH/THL tumorigenesis. These findings might provide clues for novel treatment strategies. Lymph node metastasis (LNM) in gastric cancer is a prognostic factor and has implications for the extent of lymph node dissection. The lymphatic drainage of the stomach involves multiple nodal stations with different risks of metastases. The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning system for predicting LNMs in multiple nodal stations based on preoperative CT images in patients with gastric cancer.\\nPreoperative CT images from patients who underwent gastrectomy with lymph node dissection at two medical centres were analysed retrospectively. Using a discovery patient cohort, a system of deep convolutional neural networks was developed to predict pathologically confirmed LNMs at 11 regional nodal stations. To gain understanding about the networks\\' prediction ability, gradient-weighted class activation mapping for visualization was assessed. The performance was tested in an external cohort of patients by analysis of area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.\\nThe discovery and external cohorts included 1172 and 527 patients respectively. The deep learning system demonstrated excellent prediction accuracy in the external validation cohort, with a median AUC of 0·876 (range 0·856-0·893), sensitivity of 0·743 (0·551-0·859) and specificity of 0·936 (0·672-0·966) for 11 nodal stations. The imaging models substantially outperformed clinicopathological variables for predicting LNMs (median AUC 0·652, range 0·571-0·763). By visualizing nearly 19\\u2009000 subnetworks, imaging features related to intratumoral heterogeneity and the invasive front were found to be most useful for predicting LNMs.\\nA deep learning system for the prediction of LNMs was developed based on preoperative CT images of gastric cancer. The models require further validation but may be used to inform prognosis and guide individualized surgical treatment.\\nEn el cáncer gástrico, la presencia de metástasis en los ganglios linfáticos (lymph node metastases, LNM) es un factor pronóstico y tienen implicaciones en la extensión de la disección ganglionar. El drenaje linfático del estómago involucra múltiples estaciones nodales con diferentes riesgos de metástasis. El objetivo de este estudio fue desarrollar un sistema de aprendizaje completo para predecir metástasis en los ganglios linfáticos en múltiples estaciones nodales basado en imágenes preoperatorias de tomografía computarizada (TC) en pacientes con cáncer gástrico. MÉTODOS: Se analizaron retrospectivamente las imágenes de TC preoperatorias de pacientes que se sometieron a gastrectomía con disección de los ganglios linfáticos en dos centros médicos. Utilizando una cohorte de descubrimiento de 1.172 pacientes, se desarrolló un sistema de redes neuronales convolucionales profundas para predecir LNM patológicamente confirmadas en 11 estaciones nodales regionales. Para comprender la predicción de las redes, se evaluó el mapeo de activación de clase ponderado por gradiente para la visualización. El rendimiento se evaluó en una cohorte externa de 527 pacientes mediante áreas bajo la curva de las características operativas del receptor (areas under the curve, AUCs), sensibilidad y especificidad.\\nEl sistema de aprendizaje completo demostró una excelente precisión de predicción en la cohorte de validación externa, con una mediana de AUC de 0,876 (rango: 0,856-0,893), sensibilidad de 0,743 (rango: 0,621-0,859) y especificidad de 0,923 (rango: 0,783-0,976) para 11 estaciones nodales. Los modelos de imagen superaron sustancialmente las variables clinicopatológicas (mediana AUC: 0,652, rango: 0,571-0,763) para predecir LNM. Al visualizar casi 19.000 sub-redes, se descubrió que las características de imagen relacionadas con la heterogeneidad intratumoral y el carácter invasivo fueron las más útiles para predecir LNM. CONCLUSIÓN: Se desarrolló un sistema de aprendizaje completo para la predicción de metástasis en los ganglios linfáticos en el cáncer gástrico basado en imágenes preoperatorias de TC. Los modelos requieren validación adicional, pero pueden usarse para informar sobre el pronóstico y guiar el tratamiento quirúrgico individualizado. Intraoperative localization of endoluminal lesions is can be difficult during laparoscopy. Preoperative endoscopic marking is therefore necessary. Current methods include submucosal tattooing using visible dyes, which in case of transmural injection can impair surgical dissection. Tattooing using indocyanine green (ICG) coupled to intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopy has been described. ICG is only visible under NIR-light, therefore, it doesn\\'t impair the surgical workflow under white light even if there is spillage. However, ICG tattoos have rapid diffusion and short longevity. We propose fluorescent over-the-scope clips (FOSC), using a novel biocompatible fluorescent paint, as durable lesion marking.\\nIn six pigs, gastric and colonic endoscopic tattoos using 0.05\\xa0mg/mL of ICG and markings using the fluorescent OSC were performed (T0). Simultaneously, NIR laparoscopy was executed. Follow-up laparoscopies were conducted at postoperative day (POD) 4-6 (T1) and POD 11-12 (T2). During laparoscopy, fluorescence intensity was assessed. In one human cadaver, FOSC was used to mark a site on the stomach and on the sigmoid colon, respectively. Intraoperative detection during NIR laparoscopy was assessed.\\nGastric and colonic ICG tattooing and OSC markings were easily visible using NIR laparoscopy on T0. All FOSC were visible at T1 and T2 in both stomach and colon, whereas the ICG tattooing at T1 was only visible in the stomach of 2 animals and in the colon of 3 animals. At T2, tattoos were not visible in any animal. FOSC were still visible in both stomach and colon of the human cadaver at 10\\xa0days.\\nEndoscopic marking using FOSC can be an efficient and durable alternative to standard methods. Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is an important transcription factor in the hedgehog signalling pathway and tumour formation. We evaluated the clinical significance of GLI1 expression as a prognostic factor in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (GC).\\nGLI1 expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of cancerous and adjacent normal mucosa specimens obtained from 142 patients with Stage II/III GC administered adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 after curative resection. The associations of GLI1 expression with clinicopathological features and survival were evaluated.\\nClinicopathological features and GLI1 expression showed no association. Overall survival was significantly poorer in the high compared to the low GLI1 expression group (p=0.04). Multivariate analysis revealed that GLI1 expression was a significant independent prognostic factor [p=0.019, hazard ratio (HR)=1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.70-3.38].\\nGLI1 expression may be a useful prognostic marker in patients with locally advanced GC. The survival benefit of negative resection margins in patients who undergo gastrectomy with positive peritoneal lavage cytology (CY1) is unknown.\\nWe reviewed the medical records of 128 patients with CY1 but no other distant metastases who had undergone R1 gastrectomy, 21 of whom had positive margins. We compared overall survival (OS) according to margin status.\\nThe positive-margin group had poorer performance status scores (p=0.02), higher number of patients had undergone limited lymphadenectomy (p=0.01), had type 4 tumors (p=0.01), and undifferentiated type (p=0.02). Median OS was 19.0 and 16.9 months in the groups with negative and positive margins, respectively (HR=1.26, 95%CI=0.75-2.12, p=0.39). An inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis showed an OS of 13.1 and 11.9 months for the groups with negative and positive margins, respectively (HR=0.83, 95%CI=0.43-1.63, p=0.59).\\nThe prognoses of patients with CY1 and negative or positive margins may be equivalent. Despite improved treatment for gastric cancer (GC), the prognosis of advanced disease remains poor. Further investigation of the oncogenic sequence for GC is needed.\\nThe expression of TYRO3 protein tyrosine kinase in five GC cell lines was confirmed using western blotting. TYRO3 knockdown in GC cells, and bromodeoxyuridine and Transwell assays were used to examine the functions of TYRO3 in tumor proliferation and invasion. Finally, TYRO3 expression in 138 patients who underwent curative gastric resection for advanced GC (Union for International Cancer Control stage II/III) was tested by immunohistochemistry, and the association between prognosis and TYRO3 expression was analyzed.\\nTYRO3 was detected at various levels in all the tested GC cell lines. Deleting TYRO3 significantly suppressed proliferation and invasion. Immunohistochemistry revealed TYRO3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with GC.\\nTYRO3 appears to mediate tumor progression and predict prognosis of patients with GC. We established a new patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of gastric cancer liver metastasis and evaluated the efficacy of a novel combination chemotherapy, gemcitabine (GEM) plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), compared to a standard regimen of oxaliplatinum (L-OHP) plus 5-FU on the liver metastasis.\\nPatient-derived gastric cancer was established in nude mice from the patient\\' s surgical tumor specimen. A single tumor fragment was implanted in the liver of nude mice. The mice with tumors were treated by GEM plus 5-FU or L-OHP plus 5-FU.\\nGEM plus 5-FU or L-OHP plus 5-FU significantly and similarly inhibited tumor growth on the liver compared to the untreated control (p=0.007, p=0.02, respectively).\\nGEM plus 5-FU could be a novel future clinical alternative to L-OHP plus 5-FU in gastric cancer patients who cannot tolerate platinum drugs. The purpose of this study was to compare 3D treatment plans implemented using 6 MV Linac with a retrofitted multileaf collimator (MLC) based cobalt-60 plans. In this retrospective study, DVH analysis was used to compare homogeneity of dose within the target and the dose received by critical organs. A prototype MLC designed and developed as a retrofit to current cobalt-60 teletherapy machines with a dedicated 3D treatment planning system was used. Cases representing 5 tumor sites like head & neck, glottis, lung, gall bladder, stomach were taken for the study, which were planned using Eclipse treatment planning system and treated with 6 MV photon beams. The plans were re-planned using the retrofit cobalt-60 MLC with same beam arrangement and dose prescription in Radiation Oncology planning system (ROPS). For each case, DVH data was evaluated for both types of beam energies. Conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) for target were calculated and compared. The conformal plans created using cobalt MLC for five sites were found to be similar to those planned using 6 MV photon beams. CI values close to unity reflected dose uniformity in the target volume while HI evaluated the hotspots in the target volume. It was concluded that plans created using retrofit prototype MLC developed for cobalt-60 teletherapy machines can provide dose distributions comparable to 6 MV photon beams. The prototype MLC developed can provide a promising treatment option for existing telecobalt machines in implementing conformal therapy in developing countries. The pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ located in the duodenal loop with the posterior wall of the stomach overlying it and the left lobe of the liver lying anteriorly to it. Tissues from these organs, in addition to the lesion of interest within the pancreas, may be sampled during fine-needle aspiration (FNA) procedures. Therefore, it is important to recognize the cytology of normal benign components of the pancreas and potential contaminants in order to render a correct diagnosis and avoid pitfalls. Normal components of the pancreas include ductal epithelial cells, acinar cells, and islet cells. In addition to the normal pancreatic cells, it is not uncommon to encounter epithelial cells from the duodenal and gastric mucosa with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. It is important to recognize these cells as benign and to distinguish them from a well-differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Besides these, mesothelial cells and hepatocytes and bile duct cells from the liver may be sampled as well. Here, the cytological features of normal components and contaminants are described in detail. We aimed to determine the pathogenesis of gastric mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) and pure neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), which is largely unknown. Targeted DNA sequencing was performed on 34 tumor samples from 21 patients - 13 adenocarcinoma (ADC)/NEC components from MANECs and eight pure NECs - and 21 matched non-neoplastic gastric tissues. Mutational profiles of MANECs/NECs were compared with those of other tumors using public databases. The majority (64.1%; 59/92) of mutations in MANEC were shared by both ADC and NEC components. TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in MANEC (69.2%, 9/13) and pure NEC (87.5%, 8/9). All TP53 mutations in MANEC were pathogenic mutations and were shared by both ADC and NEC components. A subset of TP53 Few studies have estimated the probability of being cured for cancer patients. This study aims to estimate population-based indicators of cancer cure in Europe by type, sex, age and period.\\n7.2 million cancer patients (42 population-based cancer registries in 17 European countries) diagnosed at ages 15-74 years in 1990-2007 with follow-up to 2008 were selected from the EUROCARE-5 dataset. Mixture-cure models were used to estimate: (i) life expectancy of fatal cases (LEF); (ii) cure fraction (CF) as proportion of patients with same death rates as the general population; (iii) time to cure (TTC) as time to reach 5-year conditional relative survival (CRS) >95%.\\nLEF ranged from 10\\u2009years for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients to <6\\u2009months for those with liver, pancreas, brain, gallbladder and lung cancers. It was 7.7\\u2009years for patients with prostate cancer at age 65-74\\u2009years and >5\\u2009years for women with breast cancer. The CF was 94% for testis, 87% for thyroid cancer in women and 70% in men, 86% for skin melanoma in women and 76% in men, 66% for breast, 63% for prostate and <10% for liver, lung and pancreatic cancers. TTC was <5\\u2009years for testis and thyroid cancer patients diagnosed below age 55\\u2009years, and <10\\u2009years for stomach, colorectal, corpus uteri and melanoma patients of all ages. For breast and prostate cancers, a small excess (CRS\\u2009<\\u200995%) remained for at least 15\\u2009years.\\nEstimates from this analysis should help to reduce unneeded medicalization and costs. They represent an opportunity to improve patients\\' quality of life. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. Many are benign, while some are malignant. They most commonly occur in the intestine. While the liver is a common site of metastases.\\nWe describe a 73-year-old female who reported to our center with complains of swelling and pain in the right upper quadrant of stomach. CECT revealed large well-localized multicystic mass in the right lobe of the liver. A suspicion of hydatid cyst was given. However, immunogenic tests results were negative for hydatid cyst. The AFP level was also unremarkable.\\nHistopathological examination with immunohistochemical panel along with other serological and radiological investigations made the diagnosis possible due to its vague clinical presentation. Gastric carcinoma represents the second most common type of malignancy that contributes to cancer-related mortality worldwide. However, the geographic incidence of gastric carcinoma had changed over the last few decades, possibly due to increased hygiene, increased awareness of the importance of healthy nutrition, and increased rates of eradication of  Accounting for less than one percent of all GI tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors are uncommon neoplasms that arise from the intestinal cells of Cajal. They can arise anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract, but most often arise from the stomach or small bowel. Usually, they are small and present with vague symptoms such as abdominal pain and are found incidentally. They usually don\\'t involve other structures unless they metastasize. Here, we present a case of small bowel GIST. The patient is a 72-year-old male who was seen in the clinic with symptoms of abdominal pain for 4 months along with intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding for 6 years. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the small bowel with no signs of obstruction. During surgery, a 9 cm by 9 cm small bowel mass was identified with adhesions to the appendix, omentum, and a segment of small bowel. There was also a hemoperitoneum. En bloc resection was performed with clean margins. Histopathology report showed malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor with focal involvement of adjacent small bowel loop. Tumor-targeting nanomaterial-based chemotherapeutic drug delivery systems have been shown to represent an efficacious approach for the treatment of cancer because of their stability in blood circulation and predictable delivery patterns, enhanced tumor-selective drug accumulation, and decreased toxicity to normal tissues. The cell-surface transmembrane glycoprotein CD44 binds to the extracellular domain of hyaluronic acid (HA), and is overexpressed in breast, ovarian, lung, and stomach cancer. In this study, an HA-based nano-carrier incorporating doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (CDDP) was synthesized as a CD44-targeting anti-cancer drug delivery system, and its tumor inhibition effects against CD44 The correlation between the radiosensitivity genes combined with CD19 status and clinical outcome was investigated to identify gastric cancer (GC) patients who would benefit from radiotherapy combined with CAR-T cell therapy.\\nThe gene expression and clinical features were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Stomach Cancer (STAD). To identify the hub radiosensitivity genes and CD19 status, 407 patients were categorized into two groups: radiosensitivity (RS) and radioresistance (RR) based on the prognosis. The chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were applied to compare the differential expression in these groups and analyze the correlation between the gene expression and clinical outcome and features. Finally, the influencing factors for the prognosis of GC were investigated by multiple Cox regression, especially in RS patients.\\nA total of 15 differential expression genes, containing two communities with 8 hub radiosensitivity genes, were identified. We also identified a 2-gene signature model with a negative coefficient and calculated the risk score for the prognosis of GC. Also, \\nThe radiosensitivity gene signature and CD19 expression predicted the clinical outcome of GC patients. Endoscopy-based Kyoto classification for gastritis and pathological topographic distribution of neutrophil infiltration are correlated with gastric cancer risk.\\nTo investigate the association between Kyoto classification and the topographic distribution of neutrophil activity.\\nKyoto classification score, ranging from 0 to 8, consisted of atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, enlarged folds, nodularity, and diffuse redness. Neutrophil activity was scored according to the updated Sydney System using biopsy samples obtained from the greater curvature of the corpus and the antrum. The participants were divided into four categories, inactive stomach, antrum-predominant gastritis, pangastritis, and corpus-predominant gastritis, based on the topographic distribution of neutrophil activity. Effects of sex, age, body mass index, drinking habit, smoking habit, family history of gastric cancer, serum \\nA total of 327 patients (comprising 50.7% women, with an average age of 50.2 years) were enrolled in this study. \\nThe Kyoto classification score was associated with the topographic distribution of neutrophil activity. To describe a patient with BRCA1 mutation, mucoepidermoid parotid, multiple breasts, and thyroid cancers.\\nA women was diagnosed at 33-years-age with a triple-negative breast cancer (right breast), at 43-years-age with a triple-negative breast cancer in left breast and at 53-years-age with a primary papillary-thyroid carcinoma. At 55-years-age, she was diagnosed with a primary mucoepidermoid carcinoma in right parotid, and concomitantly, her right nipple was affected by Paget\\'s disease and a recurrent carcinoma in right breast (HR\\xa0+\\xa0/HER2\\xa0=\\xa03\\xa0+). At 57-years-age, after the recurrence of a triple-negative breast cancer (left breast), a geneticist evaluated the patient\\'s family history, including one stomach, one non-smoking-related lung, and two smoking-related laryngeal cancers. Genetic testing revealed a BRCA1 mutation (Chr17:41:251.867). The patient\\'s daughter (a non-cancer patient) tested negative for the mutation. Both remain under medical supervision.\\nWe suggest that BRCA1 mutations are associated with non-breast and non-ovarian cancers such as salivary gland cancer. The left renal vein lymph node (LRVLN) may be the extended locoregional node in esophagogastric junction cancer; however, only open-surgical methods of dissection have been reported. We therefore developed a novel minimally invasive laparoscopic method for LRVLN dissection. Following esophagectomy, the stomach was mobilized and LRVLN dissection was started by taping the pancreatic body using two silicone drains. The transverse mesocolon was then retracted through the superior duodenal fossa to expose the horizontal duodenum and permit LRVLN dissection. We carried out the procedure successfully in 17 patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer. The median total and laparoscopic operative times were 415 and 161\\xa0min, respectively. Postoperative esophagectomy-related complications occurred in six patients. The median estimated blood loss was 120\\xa0ml and hospital stay was 15\\xa0days. This minimally invasive laparoscopic LRVLN dissection method was safe and effective, and may support faster recovery and earlier postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with esophagogastric junction cancer. This work aimed to develop and validate a deep learning radiomics model for evaluating serosa invasion in gastric cancer.\\nA total of 572 gastric cancer patients were included in this study. Firstly, we retrospectively enrolled 428 consecutive patients (252 in the training set and 176 in the test set I) with pathological confirmed T3 or T4a. Subsequently, 144 patients who were clinically diagnosed cT3 or cT4a were prospectively allocated to the test set II. Histological verification was based on the surgical specimens. CT findings were determined by a panel of three radiologists. Conventional hand-crafted features and deep learning features were extracted from three phases CT images and were utilized to build radiomics signatures via machine learning methods. Incorporating the radiomics signatures and CT findings, a radiomics nomogram was developed via multivariable logistic regression. Its diagnostic ability was measured using receiver operating characteristiccurve analysis.\\nThe radiomics signatures, built with support vector machine or artificial neural network, showed good performance for discriminating T4a in the test I and II sets with area under curves (AUCs) of 0.76-0.78 and 0.79-0.84. The nomogram had powerful diagnostic ability in all training, test I and II sets with AUCs of 0.90 (95 % CI, 0.86-0.94), 0.87 (95 % CI, 0.82-0.92) and 0.90 (95 % CI, 0.85-0.96) respectively. The net reclassification index revealed that the radiomics nomogram had significantly better performance than the clinical model (p-values < 0.05).\\nThe deep learning radiomics model based on CT images is effective at discriminating serosa invasion in gastric cancer. None Cardia adenocarcinoma (CA) is a distinct form of gastric cancer, and the optimal means of treating it remains controversial. At present, the role of the condensation complex gene non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) in CA is uncertain, and as such the present study was designed to elucidate its importance in this oncogenic context.\\nWe first used bioinformatics approaches to assess NCAPG expression profiles in CA using public databases. Protein profiling was also used to examine the expression of this protein in CA tumors and adjacent tissues from 20 patients. Then the expression of NCAPG in CA samples was quantified via qRT-PCR and Western blotting. NCAPG knockdown and overexpression in the SGC-7901 and AGS cell lines were subsequently performed, after which the expression of key proteins associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT; E-cadherin, vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail, Slug) and the regulation of apoptotic responses (caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2) was measured. The mechanistic role of NCAPG in CA was additionally studied by analyzing proteins associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling including Wnt1, phosphorylated GSK3β, β-catenin, and phosphorylated β- catenin. The impact of NCAPG on the migration, survival, and invasion of CA cells was further examined.\\nCA samples exhibited high NCAPG expression. When this gene was overexpressed in cell lines, it reduced caspase-3, Bax, and E-cadherin levels whereas it elevated Bcl-2, vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail, and Slug levels. NCAPG overexpression also resulted in the enhanced expression of Wnt1, phosphorylated GSK3β, and total β-catenin and the reduced expression of phosphorylated β-catenin. The knockdown of NCAPG, in contrast, yielded the opposite phenotype. At a functional level, the overexpression of NCAPG improved the apoptotic resistance of CA cells while driving them to undergo EMT and to become more invasive and migratory.\\nNCAPG overexpression can promote EMT and suppress tumor cell apoptosis via the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Decisions about multimodality treatment for upper gastrointestinal malignancies are largely predicted on clinical staging information. However, hospital-level accuracy of clinical staging is currently unknown.\\nA national cohort study of patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, stomach, or pancreas in the NCDB (2006-2015) who were treated with upfront resection. Hospital-level staging accuracy (ascertained by comparing clinical stage to pathologic stage) was calculated. Within hospital correlation of staging accuracy across disease sites was evaluated using risk and reliability adjustment.\\nOverall, 1246 hospitals were evaluated. Median hospital T-staging accuracy was 77.5%, 73.7%, and 60.8% for esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer, respectively. Median hospital N-staging accuracy was 80.2%, 72.9%, and 61.8%, respectively. For T-stage, over-staging was most frequently observed in esophageal patients (11.2%) while under-staging was most frequent in pancreatic patients (36.1%). For N-stage, over-staging was infrequent for all three, while under-staging was most common in pancreatic patients (37.4%). Correlation across disease sites was weak for both T- (best observed, r\\u2009=\\u2009.34) and N-stages (r\\u2009=\\u2009.30). When high volume hospitals were evaluated, correlation improved but accuracy rates were similar.\\nDespite the importance of clinical staging in multimodality treatment planning, hospitals inaccurately stage 20-40% of patients, with low correlation across disease sites. BACKGROUND The upper stomach can be involved in 1 type of esophageal hiatal hernia in which the degree of stomach insertion is considerable and accompanied by a twist in the shaft of the stomach. The diagnostic accuracy of upper endoscopy or barium meal examination decreases in patients with upside-down stomach, thus making diagnosis of stomach lesions very difficult. No previous reports have described scirrhous gastric cancer in a patient with upside-down stomach. CASE REPORT An 85-year-old woman presented with loss of appetite and vomiting after eating oxalic acid-containing food 2 months previously. Computed tomography revealed an upside-down stomach, and upper endoscopy revealed loss of distensibility and superficial gastritis of the entire stomach. Upside-down stomach was diagnosed; accordingly, laparoscopic hernia repair was planned. Laparoscopic exploration revealed retention of serous fluid (i.e., ascites) containing gastric carcinoma cells (pathologically identified intraoperatively) and induration of the entire stomach. After converting to laparotomy, induration of the stomach was confirmed, continuing to the adjacent 4 cm of the distal esophagus. The patient was diagnosed with scirrhous gastric cancer. Esophageal hiatus hernia repair was performed due to the patient\\'s age and the risks associated with esophagojejunostomy. Preoperative complaints of symptoms disappeared. The patient was transferred to the medical hospital on postoperative day 52 with no complications. CONCLUSIONS Specific symptoms of gastric cancer can mimic those of esophageal hiatal hernia in patients with hernia. In cases of upside-down stomach with loss of distensibility and increased wall thickness, physicians should be aware of the possibility of scirrhous gastric cancer. We aimed to examine whether the number of types of hazardous operations at work experienced through a lifetime is associated with cancer incidence, and additionally examined the combined effects with lifestyle-related factors. Using a nationwide, multicenter, hospital inpatient dataset (2005-2015), we conducted a matched case-control study with 1\\xa0149\\xa0296 study subjects. We classified the participants into those with none, 1, or 2 or more types of hazardous operation experience, based on information of special medical examinations taken, mandatory in Japan for workers engaged in hazardous operations. Using those with no experience as the reference group, we estimated the odds ratios for cancer incidence (all sites, lung, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, pancreas, bile duct, and bladder) by conditional logistic regression with multiple imputations. We also examined the effects of the combination with hazardous operations and lifestyle-related factors. We observed increased risks for cancer of all sites, and lung, pancreas, and bladder cancer associated with the experience of hazardous operations. Multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of cancer incidence of all sites were 1 (reference), 1.16 (1.12, 1.21), and 1.17 (1.08, 1.27) for none, 1, and 2 or more types of hazardous operation experience, respectively (P for trend <.001). Potential combined associations of hazardous operations with smoking were observed for lung, pancreas, and bladder cancer, and with diabetes for pancreas cancer. Engaging in hazardous operations at work and in combination with lifestyle-related factors may increase the risk of cancer. We highlight the potential for those engaged in hazardous work to avoid preventable cancers. The classification of gastric cardiac carcinoma (GCC) is controversial. It is currently grouped with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) as an adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Recently, diagnostic criteria for adenocarcinoma in the GEJ were established and GCC was separated from EAC. We viewed published evidence to clarify the GCC entity for better patient management. GCC arises in the cardiac mucosa located from 3\\u2009cm below and 2\\u2009cm above the GEJ line. Compared with EAC, GCC is more like gastric cancer and affects a higher proportion of female patients, younger patients, those with a lower propensity for reflux disease, a wider histopathologic spectrum, and more complex genomic profiles. Although GCC pathogenesis mechanisms remain unknown, the two-etiology proposal is appealing: in high-risk regions, the Correa pathway with Helicobacter pylori infection, chronic inflammation, low acid and intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma may apply, while in low-risk regions the sequence from reflux toxin-induced mucosal injury and high acid, to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma may occur. In early GCC a minimal risk of nodal metastasis argues for a role of endoscopic therapy, whereas in advanced GCC, gastric cancer staging rules and treatment strategy appear to be more appropriate than the esophageal cancer staging scheme and therapy for better prognosis stratification and treatment. In this brief review we share recent insights into the epidemiology, histopathology and genetics of GCC and hope that this will stimulate further investigations in order to improve the clinical management of patients with GCC.  Current prevention and/or treatment options for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are limited as no vaccine is available. Prophylaxis with palivizumab is very expensive and requires multiple intramuscular injections over the RSV season. Here we present proof-of-concept data using nebulized palivizumab delivery as a promising new approach for the prevention or treatment of severe RSV infections, documenting both aerosol characteristics and pulmonary deposition patterns in the lungs of lambs.\\nProspective animal study.\\nBiosecurity Control Level 2-designated large animal research facility at the Murdoch Children\\'s Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia.\\nFour weaned Border-Leicester/Suffolk lambs at 5 months of age.\\nFour lambs were administered aerosolized palivizumab conjugated to Tc-99m, under gaseous anesthesia, using either the commercially available AeroNeb Go\\nBoth the HYDRA and AeroNeb Go\\nAerosolized palivizumab deposition patterns were similar in all lambs, suggesting a promising approach in the control of severe RSV lung infections. Although a certain proportion of intramucosal carcinomas (IMCs) of the stomach does metastasize, the majority of patients are currently treated with endoscopic resection without lymph node dissection, and this potentially veils any existing metastasis and may put some patients in danger. In this regard, biological markers from the resected IMC that can predict metastasis are warranted. Here, we discovered unique miRNA expression profiles that consist of 21 distinct miRNAs that are specifically upregulated (miR-628-5p, miR-1587, miR-3175, miR-3620-5p, miR-4459, miR-4505, miR-4507, miR-4720-5p, miR-4742-5p, and miR-6779-5p) or downregulated (miR-106b-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-151b, miR-181d-5p, miR-486-5p, miR-500a-3p, miR-502-3p, miR-1231, miR-3609, and miR-6831-5p) in metastatic (M)-IMC compared to nonmetastatic (N)-IMC, or nonneoplastic gastric mucosa. Intriguingly, most of these selected miRNAs showed stepwise increased or decreased expression from nonneoplastic tissue to N-IMC to M-IMC. This suggests that common oncogenic mechanisms are gradually intensified during the metastatic process. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we demonstrated that such miRNA signatures could distinguish M-IMC from N-IMC. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed that TGF-β signaling was enriched from upregulated miRNAs, whereas E2F targets, apoptosis-related, hypoxia-related, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, were enriched from downregulated miRNAs. Immunohistochemical staining of samples from multiple institutions indicated that PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway components, MAPK1, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, and pS6 were highly expressed and the expression of SMAD7, a TGF-β pathway component, was decreased in M-IMC, which could aid in distinguishing M-IMC from N-IMC. The miRNA signature discovered in this study is a valuable biological marker for identifying metastatic potential of IMCs, and provides novel insights regarding the metastatic progression of IMC. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is considered as one of the principal risk factors of gastric cancer. Constitutive activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays an important role in inflammation-associated gastric carcinogenesis. In the canonical STAT3 pathway, phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705 is a major event of STAT3 activation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that STAT3 phosphorylated on Ser727 has an independent function in mitochondria. In the present study, we found that human gastric epithelial AGS cells infected with H. pylori resulted in localization of STAT3 phosphorylated on Ser727 (P-STAT3 Carcinosarcoma is a rare neoplasm with a poor prognosis that is most often discovered at an advanced stage; a gastric carcinosarcoma is even rarer than carcinosarcomas originating in other organs, such as the uterus. We report our experience with an early-stage multi-differentiated gastric carcinosarcoma.\\nA 68-year-old male patient presented with anemia, and his fecal occult blood test was positive. An endoscopic examination was conducted which revealed a hemorrhagic, irregular, protruding lesion in the stomach. The lesion was diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma by histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen, and a segmental gastrectomy was performed.

Local recurrence as in this patient, and even in early-stage cases, requires cautious surveillance to check for post-resection recurrence and metastasis. The etiopathogenesis of carcinosarcoma has not yet been elucidated; however, in the present case, despite the tumor\\'s relatively small size, it exhibited various types of differentiation in both the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components and a proliferative germ cell-like portion, which suggests that the monoclonal origin hypothesis may be a valid theory for the carcinosarcoma. Although \\nIn this retrospective study, we analyzed 293 STAD samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas with complete clinicopathological feature profiles. The m\\nThe m\\nWe established an m To describe the clinical features, therapeutic interventions, and patient outcomes of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage in individuals with a telomere biology disorder, including dyskeratosis congenita, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, Revesz syndrome, and Coats plus.\\nClinical Care Consortium for Telomere Associated Ailments members were invited to contribute data on individuals with telomere biology disorders at their institutions who experienced GI bleeding. Patient demographic, laboratory, imaging, procedural, and treatment information and outcomes were extracted from the medical record.\\nSixteen patients who experienced GI hemorrhage were identified at 11 centers. Among 14 patients who underwent genetic testing, 8 had mutations in TINF2, 4 had mutations in CTC1 or STN1, and 1 patient each had a mutation in TERC and RTEL1. Ten patients had a history of hematopoietic cell transplantation. The patients with Coats plus and those without Coats plus had similar clinical features and courses. Angiodysplasia of the stomach and/or small bowel was described in 8 of the 12 patients who underwent endoscopy; only 4 had esophageal varices. Various medical interventions were trialed. No single intervention was uniformly associated with cessation of bleeding, although 1 patient had a sustained response to treatment with bevacizumab. Recurrence was common, and the overall long-term outcome for affected patients was poor.\\nGI bleeding in patients with telomere biology disorders is associated with significant morbidity and with vascular ectasias rather than varices. Current guidelines recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locoregional gastric adenocarcinoma. Patients diagnosed with early stage gastric adenocarcinoma are usually managed with upfront surgical intervention. However, pathologic staging in a subset of these clinically staged patients identifies more advanced locoregional disease requiring adjuvant treatment. Therefore, identifying these patients prior to surgical intervention is critical to ensure employment of the appropriate treatment paradigm. The aim of the current study was to define patient characteristics associated with clinical understaging in early gastric cancer.\\nUsing the National Cancer Database (2004-2014) we identified 3,892 individuals with clinical T1N0 gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent upfront definitive surgery, had negative surgical margins, and did not receive preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patient characteristics were compared between those with pathologic stage T1N0 disease and those who were upstaged upon surgery.\\nTwenty-seven percent of clinical T1N0 gastric adenocarcinomas had a change in stage because of pathologically defined ≥T2 disease or positive lymph nodes. Individuals who were upstaged had a higher tumor grade compared with those with pathologic stage T1N0 disease. Specifically, 41.9% (530/1,264) of individuals with a poorly differentiated tumor were upstaged, compared with only 10.7% (70/656) with a well-differentiated tumor. Approximately 75% of cases involved upstaging because of T misclassification. The highest percentage of upstaging was shown for tumors located at the fundus and body of the stomach.\\nUpstaging of clinical T1N0 gastric adenocarcinoma is characterized by higher tumor grade and is mostly a result of a change in T stage. These findings mandate thorough workup in order to identify patients with clinically staged T1N0 disease requiring preoperative chemotherapy.\\nUpstaging of clinical T1N0 gastric adenocarcinoma is characterized by higher tumor grade and is mostly a result of a change in T stage. These findings mandate thorough workup in order to identify patients with clinically staged T1N0 disease requiring preoperative chemotherapy. In surgical dissection, laparoscopic approach and open techniques do not differ significantly, but there is still no consensus on how anastomosis should be performed in both cardia and distal gastric tumors. Anastomosis can be performed by laparoscopy-assisted mini-laparotomy or by intracorporeal suture techniques. In this study, we aim to present our four years of clinical experience and short-term surgical results from 133 cases in order to evaluate the necessity of laparoscopic anastomosis.\\nThis study was approved by Ethics Committee (No: 1-8-19, date: 14/01/2019). Patients who underwent curative resection with the diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma between January 2014 and January 2018 in the Ankara University Surgical Oncology Department were included in the study.\\nOf the 133 patients included in the study, 108 (81.2) were male and the mean age was 60.51 ± 12.0 years. The time of anastomosis was significantly longer in patients undergoing intracorporeal anastomosis (p = 0.021). The incidence of anastomotic leakage was significantly higher in the group undergoing intracorporeal anastomosis (p = 0.004).\\nWe think that esophagojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy anastomoses in patients undergoing total gastrectomy should be performed with intracorporeal techniques in terms of benefit risk assessment. We believe that it is more feasible to continue the case with mini laparotomy when anastomosis is reached in patients who are planned to have gastrojejunostomy. In addition, in terms of intracorporeal anastomoses and advanced laparoscopic techniques, intracorporeal anastomoses performed in gastric cancer surgery for a laparoscopist who has completed the learning curve do not appear to be very different in terms of anastomosis safety. Robot-assisted minimally invasive oesophagectomy (RAMIE) has been developed to overcome the technical limitations of conventional thoracoscopic oesophagectomy. Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is used as a practical and useful technique during the abdominal phase of thoracoscopic oesophagectomy. During RAMIE, a robotic vessel sealer cannot be used with HALS; another vessel sealer or ultrasonic coagulating device for laparoscopic surgery is required. We report an initial experiment using hand-assisted robotic surgery (HARS) for abdominal manipulation during RAMIE as a novel method. Under the pneumoperitoneum induced by insufflating the abdomen to 10 mmHg with carbon dioxide, the assistant surgeon lifted the stomach and greater omentum using the left hand through a 7 cm upper abdominal midline incision at approximately 2 cm below the xiphoid. Subsequently, gastric mobilisation was performed by robot-assisted surgery. Between January 2019 and February 2020, eight patients with thoracic oesophageal cancer underwent RAMIE with HARS at our hospital. The median operative time for extracorporeal manipulation and preparation for the roll-in of the robot was 39.5 min. The median console time was 47.5 min. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications related to the use of the robot and no in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, HARS seems to be feasible and safe for abdominal manipulation during oesophageal cancer surgery. Although it has been proven that various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced during surgery, there have been no studies focusing specifically on endoscopy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate VOCs produced during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).\\nThirty-one patients scheduled for ESD were enrolled in this study. Sorbent tubes were installed to collect gas at two sites: one in a suction bottle and the other at the level of the endoscopists\\' upper chest. Gas collections were performed for up to 30\\xa0min during submucosal dissection. Quantitative analysis of the VOCs in gas samples was performed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Concentrations of fifteen VOCs were measured. The total concentration of volatile organic compounds (TVOC) was also calculated.\\nAmong the five carcinogens-benzene, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene (TCE)-measured, excess life-time risks of cancer for benzene and TCE were interpreted as unacceptable based on the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Air Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines (5\\u2009×\\u200910\\nVarious carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic VOCs were detected at levels higher than the reference \"safe\" values during the submucosal dissection step of ESD. Implementation of counter measures is essential to protect medical personnel who are involved in ESD surgeries. Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is the most pathological type of gastric cancer. ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 18 (ADAMTS18) plays an essential role in organ development and tumorigenesis; however, its function in STAD, and its impact on clinical outcome remain unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the association between ADAMTS18 expression and the prognosis of patients with STAD. Data from 300 patients with STAD in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed, and the median survival time and overall survival (OS) rate of these patients were assessed. Subsequently, 40 paired tumor and non-tumor tissue samples from patients with STAD were collected, and the relative ADAMTS18 mRNA expression levels were determined. Results from TCGA database demonstrated that high tumor ADAMTS18 expression was associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with STAD. Similarly, results from the assessed patient cohort indicated that ADAMTS18 expression was significantly higher in STAD tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. Furthermore, ADAMTS18 expression was significantly associated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and tumor node metastasis stage. Taken together, these results suggest that ADAMTS18 is highly expressed in STAD tissues, and thus may act as a potential indicator of poor prognosis in patients with STAD. Prostate cancer is a disease of men. An estimated 1.2 million cases were diagnosed in 2018, making it the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide. It was also the most common cancer in men aged over 55. In the same year, prostate cancer was the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related death in men in North America and Europe. From a global perspective, deaths from the liver, stomach, and esophageal cancer meant that it ranked sixth for cancer-deaths internationally.[1] The prostate is a small glandular organ (typically 20-30g in the healthy adult male) that is responsible for the production of the majority of seminal fluid. It lies anterior to the rectum and encases the urethra between the bladder neck and the external urethral sphincter. The ‘nervi erigentes’ (responsible for continence and erectile function) course from the hypogastric plexus and lie in intimate relation to its postero-lateral surfaces. These relationships are critical when considering the likely adverse events following any treatment for prostate cancer. The zonal anatomy of the prostate was described by Mc Neal in 1968 and remains in use today, with around 70% to 80% of cancers developing in the peripheral zone and cancer almost never found in the central zone.[2][3] The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM 2018 staging classification for prostate cancer is shown in table 1. Local invasion is to surrounding structures such as seminal vesicles, bladder, and rectum. Metastasis most commonly occurs via a lymphatic route to pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes and via a hematogenous route to the bone. Visceral metastasis to lung, liver, and other organs is relatively rare and associated with unusual pathology and a poor prognosis.[4][5] In clinical practice, prostate cancer is most conveniently categorized as: Localized prostate cancer (T1/2/ early T3, N0, M0). Locally advanced prostate cancer (established T3 or T4, N0/1, M0). Metastatic cancer (M1 disease). For the purposes of this article, localized prostate cancer will include cases of early T3 prostate cancer, either on the investigation (e.g., TRUS, MRI) or on final pathology (e.g., following radical prostatectomy).[6][7] The natural history of prostate cancer has been extensively studied in patients treated conservatively. Most localized prostate cancer represents an indolent disease, with population studies indicating slow progression in the majority over many years.[8] Men with\\xa0low-grade\\xa0tumors rarely die from prostate cancer. They are much more likely to die from other causes first. On the other hand, men with high-grade disease are more likely to die from prostate cancer within ten years without radical treatment. The prognosis of men with intermediate-risk cancer\\xa0is the most difficult to predict. The perceived increased risk of mortality compared to low-risk disease can often push clinicians towards radical treatment in these cases, but such a strategy has been challenged by the findings of studies such as the ProtecT study of treatments for localized prostate cancer. Prognostic markers and scoring are likely to be of great interest to this group of patients.[8] The omentum is made up of cells that are mesothelial in origin. It is said to be a type of visceral adipose tissue with a total surface area of 1500 cm2. It hangs in front of the abdominal organs like an apron, and it is also connected to the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and colon. The omentum exhibits angiogenic, fibrotic, stem cells, and immune activities responsible for promoting vascularization, accelerated healing, and limiting infection in the abdominal cavity. These activities can also lead to pathological changes like omental tumor formation and metastasis.[1]\\xa0Primary solid tumors of the greater omentum are rare, with only 42 reported cases; however, peritoneal metastasis is fairly common in some tumors like gastrointestinal stromal tumors and ovarian cancer.[2][1] This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood stomach (gastric) cancer.

Artificial nutrition refers to the provision or supplementation of daily metabolic nutrition requirements in patients with contraindications to feeding through the mouth or those with inadequate oral intake. Artificial nutrition is provided through parental or enteral access. Parenteral nutrition is provided through a large vein in the central venous system. Enteral nutrition makes use of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to provide nutrition. Enteral access can be obtained by passing a feeding tube through the nose (nasogastric and nasojejunal), mouth (orogastric) at the bedside. It can also be achieved by surgical implantation of a feeding tube into the gut, such as a feeding gastrostomy (stomach) or a feeding jejunostomy (jejunum). Historically, enteral nutrition has not been as well emphasized as parenteral nutrition because of the belief that many disease states will prevent the gut from normal absorptive function. However, it is now clear that enteral nutrition is well tolerated even in severe disease states in critically ill patients. Moreover, enteral nutrition has been associated with reduced infectious complications, lower costs, and reduced length of hospital stay.[1] Feeding jejunostomy refers to a surgically inserted tube, preferably in the proximal jejunum, to provide enteral nutrition or administer medications. This is different from a definitive jejunostomy, which is commonly done as part of gastric resection by a Roux-en-Y technique. The first person to successfully place a feeding jejunostomy was Bush in 1858, performed on a patient with inoperable gastric cancer.[2] Subsequently, Witzel, in 1891, developed the most commonly used technique for jejunostomy creation. A needle catheter technique was described by Delany et al. in 1973.[3] The invention of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy technique in the early 1980s paved the way for the development of the technique for feeding jejunostomy. After 1990, advances in laparoscopic surgical technique permitted the insertion of feeding jejunostomy techniques, Although techniques of jejunostomies have been modified over the years, the ‘Witzel technique’ is synonymous with feeding jejunostomy. This chapter is aimed at presenting\\xa0indications and contraindications of feeding jejunotomies. Furthermore, it describes the equipment, preparation, and techniques of positioning and potential complications with their management. The role of the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance feeding jejunostomies and improve outcomes is also addressed. Mitomycin is an antibiotic medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use\\xa0in the systemic therapy of\\xa0metastatic\\xa0adenocarcinoma of the stomach or pancreas in combination with other drugs.[1]\\xa0Mitomycin is also indicated for the treatment of bladder cancer, with maintenance doses of mitomycin proving effective for decreasing the tumor recurrence rate of low and intermediate-risk tumors.[2] Mastalgia is a\\xa0 medical term used for breast pain, one of the most common complaints among women of 15 to 40 years of age (child-bearing age). Approximately two-thirds of women during their reproductive lives suffer from this condition and seek medical help.\\xa0It is a dull, aching pain while some women may describe it as heaviness, tightness, discomfort, or burning sensation in the breast\\xa0tissue, which may be unilateral or bilateral. Most often, it is located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast and can sometimes radiate to an ipsilateral arm. It is most common in premenopausal and perimenopausal women, but postmenopausal women can also rarely develop such pain. The breast pain ranges from mild to severe, could be intermittent or constant throughout the day, and may interfere with the female\\'s quality of life.[1][2][3] Many a time, it is not possible to determine the exact cause of such breast pain. However, it is generally believed that in the majority of cases, such breast pain is not a sign of cancer. Still, professionals recommend a detailed medical review with proper history and physical exam done by a primary caregiver to rule out any such possibility.  Adenocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm arising from epithelial cells of the glands or glandular like structures. Adenocarcinoma can arise in multiple sites of the body. Some of the common sites that develop adenocarcinoma are the breast, lung, prostate, gastrointestinal tract like the colon, rectum, pancreas, stomach, esophagus. Adenocarcinomas also make 70 percent of cancer of unknown origin.[1] National Health Commission of the People\\'s Republic of China collaborated with many ministries and commissions government and initiated a population-based cancer screening program in high-risk area of rural China, targeting three types of cancer that are most prevalent in these areas, including esophageal, stomach and liver cancer. This study protocol was reported to show the design and evaluate the effectiveness of cancer screening and appropriate screening strategies of three cancers in rural China.\\nA two-step design with cancer risk assessment based on questionnaire interview, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test strip and subsequent clinical intervention for high-risk populations was adopted free of charge at the local hospitals designated in the program.\\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. The results will evaluate the effectiveness of cancer screening and appropriate screening strategies in rural China. Inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFP), known as Vanek tumors, are benign neoplasms, usually located in the stomach and small bowel. The prognosis is good in long term.\\nWe report a 24-year-old woman, with 3 days history of abdominal pain located in the epigastrium, accompanied by melenic evacuations and weight loss since the last month, making the diagnosis of inflammatory fibroid gastric polyp by means of the upper endoscopy and biopsy.\\nIFP are extremely rare neoplasms in the Mexican population. The symptoms range from asymptomatic, epigastralgia, anemia, and weight loss to intestinal obstruction.

Carcinoma of the gallbladder (GBC) is the most frequent tumor of the biliary tract. Despite epidemiological studies showing a correlation between chronic infection with  The optimal treatment for primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PG-DLBCL) is still unknown. We evaluated unfavorable prognostic factors and pattern of failure in PG-DLBCL to determine the optimal treatment strategy.\\nBetween April 2001 and November 2018, 120 patients with complete remission following rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. According to the Lugano staging system, 80 patients (66.7%) had localized disease and 40 patients (33.3%) had advanced disease. A total of 93 (77.5%) patients had single gastric lesion and 27 (22.5%) patients had multiple gastric lesions. Ninety patients (75%) were treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy alone and 30 patients (25%) received R-CHOP chemotherapy with additional local treatment for gastric lesions.\\nThe 5-year locoregional failure-free survival (LRFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates in patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy with local treatment were 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, whereas the LRFS, PFS, and OS rates in patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy alone were 86.3%, 78.2%, and 87.4%, respectively (p = 0.031, p = 0.095, and p = 0.025, respectively). During the follow-up period, 17 patients (14.2%) had disease recurrence. Only 3 of the 17 patients had relapse in a completely new site without relapse in the initial involved site. All, except 2, cases of local recurrence included gastric failure. In the multivariate analysis, performance status and number of gastric lesions were independent prognostic factors for treatment outcome.\\nPatients with complete remission following R-CHOP chemotherapy showed a good prognosis. The main pattern of failure in patients with PG-DLBCL was local recurrence, especially in the stomach. Patients who received local treatment for gastric lesions showed improved gastric control. Therefore, in patients with unfavorable prognostic factors, we recommend R-CHOP chemotherapy with additional local treatment for gastric lesions.  Duodenal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is an extremely rare tumor. Herein, we report multidisciplinary treatment of a patient with synchronous development of primary MALT lymphoma of the duodenum and gastric cancer. A 70-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for examination of a gastric cancer initially diagnosed by a local medical doctor. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an elevated lesion with a central ulcer in the lower body of the stomach, and a partially whitish aggregated lesion in the descending portion of the duodenum. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens from the gastric lesion showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and duodenal specimens showed low-grade MALT lymphoma composed of atypical lymphoid cells with a lymphoepithelial lesion. The patient underwent distal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection for the gastric cancer. Histological examination showed muscularis propria invading adenocarcinoma with two lymph node metastases. After operation, four courses of systemic rituximab treatment were administered for the MALT lymphoma, followed by adjuvant S-1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) chemotherapy for the gastric cancer. In the 4\\xa0months after operation, the patient was well with no evidence of recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case of synchronous gastric adenocarcinoma and duodenal MALT lymphoma in the English literature. Many patients with gastric cancer present with late stage disease. Palliative gastrectomy remains a contentious intervention aiming to debulk tumour and prevent or treat complications such as gastric outlet obstruction, perforation and bleeding.\\nWe conducted a systematic review of the literature for all papers describing palliative resections for gastric cancer and reporting peri-operative or survival outcomes. Data from peri-operative and survival outcomes were meta-analysed using random effects modelling. Survival data from patients undergoing palliative resections, non-resective surgery and palliative chemotherapy were also combined. This study was registered with the PROSPERO database (CRD42019159136).\\nOne hundred and twenty-eight papers which included 58,675 patients contributed data. At 1 year, there was a significantly improved survival in patients who underwent palliative gastrectomy when compared to non-resectional surgery and no treatment. At 2 years following treatment, palliative gastrectomy was associated with significantly improved survival compared to chemotherapy only; however, there was no significant improvement in survival compared to patients who underwent non-resectional surgery after 1 year. Palliative resections were associated with higher rates of overall complications versus non-resectional surgery (OR 2.14; 95% CI, 1.34, 3.46; p < 0.001). However, palliative resections were associated with similar peri-operative mortality rates to non-resectional surgery.\\nPalliative gastrectomy is associated with a small improvement in survival at 1 year when compared to non-resectional surgery and chemotherapy. However, at 2 and 3 years following treatment, survival benefits are less clear. Any survival benefits come at the expense of increased major and overall complications. Tumor angiogenesis is an essential event for tumor growth and metastasis. It has been showed that REC8, a component of the meiotic cohesion complex, played a vital role in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in gastric\\xa0cancer. However, the role of REC8 in gastric cancer angiogenesis remains to be identified.\\nInhibition of REC8 expression in gastric cancer cells contributed to tumor angiogenesis in the gastric cancer microenvironment. The clinical analysis demonstrated that the loss of REC8 in gastric cancer with enrichment of MVD. Depletion of REC8 expression in gastric cancer cells significantly increased tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which is attributed to enhancement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion caused by REC8 slicing. While addition of neutralizing antibody targeted VEGF into supernatant drastically reversed the effect of REC8 loss in gastric cancer cells on tube formation. Mechanistic analyses indicated that ablation of REC8 promotes nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 activity and its downstream gene VEGF expression, leading to tube formation.\\nThese results demonstrated a novel REC8 function that suppressed tumor angiogenesis and progression by attenuation of VEGF in gastric cancer microenvironment. The hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway regulates normal cell growth and differentiation. As a consequence of improper control, aberrant HH signaling results in tumorigenesis and supports aggressive phenotypes of human cancers, such as neoplastic transformation, tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. Canonical activation of HH signaling occurs through binding of HH ligands to the transmembrane receptor Patched 1 (PTCH1), which derepresses the transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO). Consequently, the glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) zinc-finger transcription factors, the terminal effectors of the HH pathway, are released from suppressor of fused (SUFU)-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration, permitting nuclear translocation and activation of target genes. Aberrant activation of this pathway has been implicated in several cancer types, including medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and cancers of lung, colon, stomach, pancreas, ovarian, and breast. Therefore, several components of the HH pathway are under investigation for targeted cancer therapy, particularly GLI1 and SMO. GLI1 transcripts are reported to undergo alternative splicing to produce truncated variants: loss-of-function GLI1ΔN and gain-of-function truncated GLI1 (tGLI1). This review covers the biochemical steps necessary for propagation of the HH activating signal and the involvement of aberrant HH signaling in human cancers, with a highlight on the tumor-specific gain-of-function tGLI1 isoform. Gastric mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (gMANEC) is a rare malignant tumor. Most gMANECs are diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a worse prognosis than gastric adenocarcinoma. In order to improve the prognosis, it is necessary to diagnose gMANEC at an early stage. However, the endoscopic features of early gMANECs are unclear. We, herein, report a case of early gMANEC that showed characteristic magnifying endoscopic findings.\\nA 78-year-old man was referred to our institution for endoscopic resection of a gastric lesion. He had a medical history of distal gastrectomy due to early gastric cancer with negative surgical margins 9 years previously.\\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a reddish depressed lesion on the suture line of the gastric remnant, which was classified as type 0-IIc according to the Paris classification. ME-NBI at the oral side of the lesion revealed the absence of the microsurface pattern (MSP) and scattered microvessels with dilation and caliber variation, while ME-NBI at the anal side showed an irregularly tubular MSP. An endoscopic forceps biopsy showed a well- to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.\\nWe performed endoscopic submucosal dissection, and en bloc resection of the tumor was successfully achieved.\\nThe histological findings showed two distinct components: neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, which comprised ∼60% and 40% of the tumor, respectively. The NEC component corresponded to the site with the absence of an MSP and scattered microvessels on ME-NBI, while the well-differentiated adenocarcinoma component corresponded to the site with an irregularly tubular MSP. The pathological diagnosis was mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma, infiltrating into the deep submucosal layer.\\nWe propose that the absence of an MSP plus an irregular MSP is characteristics of gMANEC, which was useful for the diagnosis of gMANEC before treatment. In stomach, metaplasia can arise from differentiated chief cells that become mitotic via paligenosis, a stepwise program. In paligenosis, mitosis initiation requires reactivation of the cellular energy hub mTORC1 after initial mTORC1 suppression by DNA damage induced transcript 4 (DDIT4 aka REDD1). Here, we use DDIT4-deficient mice and human cells to study how metaplasia increases tumorigenesis risk.\\nA tissue microarray of human gastric tissue specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for DDIT4. C57BL/6 mice were administered combinations of intraperitoneal injections of high-dose tamoxifen (TAM) to induce Spasmolytic Polypeptide Expressing Metaplasia (SPEM) and rapamycin to block mTORC1 activity, and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) in drinking water to induce spontaneous gastric tumors. Stomachs were analyzed for proliferation, DNA damage, and tumor formation. CRISPR/Cas9-generated DDIT4\\nDDIT4 was expressed in normal gastric chief cells in mice and humans and decreased as chief cells became metaplastic. Paligenotic Ddit4\\nDuring injury-induced metaplastic proliferation, failure of licensing mTORC1 reactivation correlates with increased proliferation of cells harboring DNA damage, as well as increased tumor formation and growth in mice and humans. This study aimed to assess the potential benefits and tolerability of an empirical dose of approximately 0.8-1.2\\u2009mCi (29.6-44.4\\u2009MBq) of Re-4-hexadecyl-1-2,9,9-tetramethyl-4,7-diaza-1,10-decanethiol/lipiodol (Re-HDD/lipiodol) per milliliter of tumor volume, administered after super-selection of the tumor feeding branches of hepatic artery for treatment of inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\\nPatients with advanced HCC or classified as inoperable, with no demonstrated extrahepatic disease and no significant comorbidities were eligible. The patients selected for this study had a single tumoral lesion, measuring less than 150 cc. The range of total activity administered was between 30 and 100\\u2009mCi (1.2-3.7)\\u2009GBq Re-HDD/lipiodol, administered in the super selected branches of the hepatic artery supplying the tumor in 42 Patients. Whole-body scintigraphies and single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) of the liver including tumor were performed at four-time points after injection. Absorbed doses to the various organs were calculated according to the Medical Internal Radiation Dose formalism. Blood and urine samples were collected at multiple time points until 72\\u2009h after injection. Hematological, hepatic and pulmonary toxicity was assessed until 12\\u2009weeks after administration using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) scale. Responses were evaluated on contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and by alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) level monitoring.\\nAbout 40.6\\u2009±\\u20094.8% of the injected activity was excreted in the urine by 72\\u2009h after injection. The mean absorbed dose to the liver, lungs, stomach, kidney and intestine was 14.4\\u2009±\\u20091.8, 4.8\\u2009±\\u20090.6, 5.5\\u2009±\\u20091.1, 5.1\\u2009±\\u20090.7, and 6.5\\u2009±\\u20091.0\\u2009Gy (mean\\u2009±\\u2009SD), respectively. Up to 6\\u2009days after administration, 26 of 44 patients had adverse events consisting of aggravations of preexisting laboratory changes (24 patients), fatigue (5 patients), vomiting (6 patients), fever (2 patients), right hypochondrial pain (8 patients), and pain at site of femoral catheter insertion (8 patients). Toxicity assessment at weeks 6 and 12 revealed two cases of mild worsening of liver function tests and no lung or hematological toxicity noted. Two patients were lost to follow-up after the 6-week visit. The response was assessed on CECT in all the remaining patients and the classification of results was more standardized when using European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria rather than response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria. According to EASL criteria, 8 patients had a partial response, 28 patients had a complete response, 4 patients had progressive disease and 4 patients with stable disease were reported. Thirty-six patients had a baseline elevated AFP and on follow-up at 6\\u2009weeks, 6 of these patients showed stable AFP, progression in 4 patients and 26 showed a reduction.\\nAfter the administration of 1.2-3.7\\u2009GBq Re-HDD/lipiodol based on empirical activity calculation of 0.8-1.2\\u2009mCi/mL of tumor volume, more than half of the patients in the present study had an objective response on imaging and biochemically. No significant adverse side effects were noted and most of the laboratory markers as well as symptoms returned to normal after 48-72\\u2009h post-administration. Selective administration of the radiopharmaceutical into the tumor feeding arteries gives a good anti-tumoral effect with minimal side effects and damage to surrounding normal liver tissue.  RACGAP1 has significant involvement in tumorigenesis of cancers, including liver cancer, stomach cancer, and colon cancer. However, the role and the exact mechanism of RACGAP1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been explored.\\nQPCR and Western blots analysis was performed to analyze the expression of RACGAP1 in ESCC. MTT assays and colony formation assays were performed to explore the functional role of RACGAP1 in ESCC. Cell cycle analysis and immunofluorescence assays were used to investigate the function of RACGAP1 involvement in mitotic catastrophe. At last, we conducted the public datasets mining to explore the expression status and prognosis value of RACGAP1 as well as the correlation between RACGAP1 and E2F3 in various cancers.\\nThe high abnormal expression of RACGAP1 is observed in ESCC and associated with worse clinical outcomes of patients with ESCC. \\nOur findings showed the essential role of RACGAP1 in ESCC cancer cell survival and the therapeutic potential of RACGAP1 as a molecular target for ESCC. For the treatment of locally advanced (T4) gastric cancer, extended multi-organ resection remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the surgical outcomes and survival of patients with T4 gastric cancer extending to the transverse colon.\\nA total of 2,652 gastric cancer patients underwent surgery between December 2011 and December 2015. Data from 40 of these patients who underwent curative resection for T4 gastric cancer extending to the transverse colon were obtained. Patient characteristics, related complications, long-term survival, and prognostic factors for T4 gastric cancer were analyzed.\\nPostoperative morbidity occurred in 5 (12.5%) patients. All of the patients were cured with conservative treatment. No procedure-related mortality occurred. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 75.0%, 49.2%, and 36.9%, respectively, with a median survival time of 24 months. Univariate analysis revealed tumor size (P=0.049), advanced T stage (P=0.013), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.006) to be poor prognostic factors of OS. Advanced T stage and lymph node metastasis were identified by multivariate analysis as being independent prognostic factors. Further, it was observed that lymph node metastasis grade was associated with poorer OS.\\nPatients with T4 gastric cancer extending to the transverse colon might benefit from curative resection with acceptable morbidity and mortality. None Post-pancreaticoduodenectomy hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication that occurs in 2-10% of patients. The most common location for post-pancreaticoduodenectomy hemorrhage is the gastroduodenal artery stump. Nonetheless, unusual sources of hemorrhage, which are hard to locate, exist. Here, we report a rare postoperative hemorrhage after robotic-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer. A 67-year-old man presenting with appetite loss, general fatigue and painless jaundice was admitted to our ward. The patient had an elevated level of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (50 U/mL). Computed tomography scan revealed a 17-mm wide low-density area in the uncinate process of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed the dilation of bile and pancreatic ducts. Robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed on the patient by using the da Vinci Model S Surgical System. On postoperative days 5 and 6, the patient vomited blood, and bloody fluid was observed in the drainage. Emergent gastroscopic examination was performed and revealed a large amount of hematocele in the stomach. On postoperative day 6, emergency operation was undertaken, and the output jejunal loop was found to have intussuscepted in the stomach. This is the first case report of output jejunal loop intussusception in the stomach that consequently caused hemorrhage after robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer. Adult height has been suggested as a biomarker for a wide range of diseases. However, there are epidemiologic inconsistencies regarding the association between adult height and stomach cancer risk.\\nWe retrieved PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases to identify relevant studies assessing the relationship between height and risk of stomach cancer, published from inception to June 4, 2019. We pooled effect sizes for 5-cm height increments using a random-effect model and obtained the cumulative relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, we performed subgroup investigation with sensitivity analysis and tested for publication bias using the Begg rank correlation test.\\nWe analyzed 11 studies involving 137,451 cases. The summary of effect size (95% CI) of stomach cancer for a 5-cm-increase in adult height was 0.99 (0.95-1.02). A \"leave-one-out\" sensitivity analysis indicated that the heterogeneity decreased by a half and the result showed significance (RR, 0.972; 95% CI, 0.948-0.997). Subgroup analyses found no significant associations, with one exception. The exception also depended entirely on one study. We found no significant publication bias (P=0.276).\\nHeight is not associated with increased stomach cancer risk. Epidemiologic studies of potential confounders are needed to clarify the association. The potential prognostic value of alternative splicing (AS) variants and regulatory splicing factors in gastric carcinogenesis is unclear. We aimed to exploit the aberrant AS signatures and splicing factors involved in gastric cancer (GC) and to determine their prognostic predictive values.\\nWe performed detailed data acquisition using the Cancer Genome Atlas project and profiled genome-wide AS signatures in a cohort of 190 patients with stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Prognostic prediction models and splicing correlation networks were assessed using an integrative bioinformatics analysis approach.\\nWe detected 1,308 overall survival (OS)-related AS signatures in 993 genes, most of which were favorable prognostic factors. Six splicing factors have been suggested to be dysregulated in GC, i.e., \\nTo our knowledge, the current study provided the first comprehensive profiling of global modifications in the RNA splicing to identify survival associated AS signatures of GC specific genes. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of aberrant AS signatures and splicing factors in STAD, which can potentially be used as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GC. Augmentation cystoplasty is a surgical procedure used in the management of patients with neurogenic bladder. This procedure involves anastomosis of the bladder with gastrointestinal grafts, including portions of ileum, colon, or stomach. A rare but important complication of augmentation cystoplasty is the development of malignancy. The majority of malignancies arising in this setting have been described in case reports. A search for cases of non-urothelial carcinoma following augmentation cystoplasty was conducted through the urological pathology files of four major academic institutions. Ten cases were identified, including six cystoprostatectomy/cystectomy, two partial cystectomy, and two transurethral resection of bladder tumour specimens. The mean patient age at diagnosis was 47 years (range 27-87 years). The male:female ratio was 4:6. The tumours tended to present at an advanced stage; four cystoprostatectomy/cystectomy cases were categorised as pT3a, one was categorised as pT3b, and one was categorised as pT4a. Lymph node metastases were present in all cases which had lymph node excision (range 1-16 positive nodes per case). The majority of cases (90%) were predominantly characterised by a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features. Other morphological features included mucinous features (30%), plasmacytoid features (20%), enteric/villous architecture (10%), and large cell undifferentiated morphology (10%). This is the largest study to date on the clinicopathological features of invasive non-urothelial carcinoma of the bladder following augmentation cystoplasty. The tumours are typically poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, with diffuse signet ring cell features, aggressive, and present at high stage. Further molecular characterisation may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of this entity. This study used a prospective cohort study to observe the effect of triple-negative breast cancer on the 2-year disease-free survival rate with or without \"TCM formula\".\\nFrom November 1\\u202fst, 2016, the first patient was enrolled in the cohort study. A total of 356 patients were enrolled on January 30, 2019. Among them, 154 cases were followed up for 2 years. During the follow-up, there were 6 cases of shedding, so 6 cases were affected. A total of 148 cases were included in the analysis, including 73 in the exposed group and 75 in the non-exposed group. The exposed group was given \"TCM formula\" on the basis of standardized treatment, and the non-exposed group was treated with simple triple-negative breast cancer. The two groups visited each of the three months. The interview included safety examination (hematology and imaging). The endpoint was the difference in 2-year invasive disease-free survival between the exposed and non-exposed groups and the safety of the \"TCM formula\".\\nThere were 6 cases of shedding during the experiment and the shedding rate was 3.9 %. The 2-year rate of invasive disease-free survival in the exposed team was 88.7 % and the non-exposed group was 82.5 %. Logistic multivariate regression analysis predicted that \"TCM formula\" could reduce the disease-related recurrence and metastasis rate by 11 % (OR\\u202f=\\u202f0.89, 95 % CI 0.37-0.956, P＜0.05). Through K-M survival analysis, TNBC patients with age ≤35 years and regional lymph node stage N1 may be the benefit group of \"TCM formula\"(P＜0.05). During the study, the incidence of total adverse events was 8.2 % in the exposed group, mainly manifested as stomach discomfort, diarrhea, and hepatocyte damage.\\n1. In the exposed group, the two-year rate of invasive disease-free survival increased by 6.2 % compared with the non-exposed group(P＞0.05). 2. According to K-M survival analysis, TNBC patients with age ≤35 years and regional lymph node metastasis to N1 may be potential beneficiaries of \"TCM formula\". 3. \"TCM Formula\" is safe and tolerable to most patients. The traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbal formula Lian Hua Qing Wen (LHQW) improves the results of COVID-19 treatment. Three very recent studies analyzed with network pharmacology some working mechanisms of LHQW. However, we used more techniques and also included Angiotensin converting enzyme 2\\xa0(ACE2) (a SARS-CoV receptor, possibly the viral entry point in alveolar lung cells) and the immune system, as cytokine storm is essential in the late phase.\\nExtensive detailed Network Pharmacology analysis of the LHQW- treatment mechanism in COVID-19.\\nTCM-herb-meridian and protein interaction network (PIN) of LHQW, based on LHQW herbs meridian information and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) information of the LHQW-component targets. Hub and topological property analyses to obtain crucial targets and construct the crucial LHQW-PIN. Functional modules determination using MCODE, GO and KEGG pathway analysis of biological processes and pathway enrichment. Intersection calculations between the LHQW-proteins and ACE2 co-expression-proteins.\\nLHQW herbs have relationships to Stomach-, Heart-, Liver- and Spleen-systems, but most (10 of the 13 herbs) to the Lung system, indicating specific effects in lung diseases. The crucial LHQW PIN has the scale-free property, contains 2,480 targets, 160,266 PPIs and thirty functional modules. Six modules are enriched in leukocyte-mediated immunity, the interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway, immune response regulating signaling pathway, interleukin 23 mediated signaling pathway and Fc gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis (GO analysis). These 6 are also enriched in cancer, immune system-, and viral infection diseases (KEGG). LHQW shared 189 proteins with ACE2 co-expression proteins.\\nDetailed network analysis shows, that LHQW herbal TCM treatment modulates the inflammatory process, exerts antiviral effects and repairs lung injury. Moreover, it also relieves the \"cytokine storm\" and improves ACE2-expression-disorder-caused symptoms. These innovative findings give a rational pharmacological basis and support for treating COVID-19 and possibly other diseases with LHQW. Millions of people are suffering from chronic pain conditions, such as headache, arthritis, cancer. Apart from western medicines, traditional Chinese medicines are also well accepted for pain management, especially in Asian countries. Yuanhu-Baizhi herb pair (YB) is a typical herb pair applied to the treatment of stomach pain, hypochondriac pain, headache, and dysmenorrhea, due to its effects on analgesia and sedation. This study is to identify potentially active compounds and the underlying mechanisms of YB in the treatment of pain.\\nCompounds in YB were collected from 3 online databases and then screened by bioavailability and drug likeness parameters. Swiss target prediction was applied to obtain targets information of the active compounds. Pain-related genes were conducted for Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the genes were constructed using Cytoscape software. In addition, the hub genes were screened using maximal clique centrality (MCC) algorithm.\\nIn total, 31 compounds from Yuanhu were screened out with 35 putative target genes, while 26 compounds in Baizhi with 43 target genes were discovered. Hence, 78 potential target genes of YB were selected for further study. After overlap analysis of the 78 genes of YB and 2408 pain-associated genes, we finally achieved 34 YB-pain target genes, as well as 10 hub genes and 23 core compounds. Go enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that YB had a strong integration with neuro system, which might significantly contribute to antinociceptive effect.\\nOur data provide deep understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of YB in attenuating pain. The discovery shed new light on the development of active compounds of YB for the treatment of pain. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease treated with immunosuppressive agents, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, immunomodulation drugs and/or splenectomy. Patients with ITP have been found to have increased risk ofhematological malignancies. Studies investigating stomach/liver cancer are contradictory and the risk of developing other solid tumors is largely unknown. We aimed at estimating risk of overall and organ-specific cancers in patients with primary ITP.\\nThe study population was Swedish patients with at least one ITP diagnosis recorded in the National Patient Register and a 1:10 matched comparison cohort from the population. The study period covers 1997-2016. The Cancer Register and the Cause of Death Register provided data on malignancies and deaths, respectively. Primary ITP was identified using an established algorithm. We used time-split Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age, sex, index-year, county, income, education, Charlson score and number of in- and outpatient contacts.\\nIn total 66,134 individuals were included in the study. Patients with ITP had higher risk of gastro-intestinal, skin (all morphologies), lymphoid and hematological cancers. Adjusted HR (95 % CI) for cancer was 1.37 (1.27-1.48), with highest risk during the first year, but with increased risk remaining for up to 20 years for men. For women, the overall risk was increased during the first year, HR (95 % CI) 2.00 (1.55-2.60). A significantly increased liver cancer risk was seen up to 9 years after diagnosis.\\nPatients with primary ITP have higher risk of cancer than the population. The observed increased risk does not seem to be solely due to surveillance bias, but might be associated with ITP or its treatments. Treating hematologists need to have high index of suspicion for cancer. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gut. GISTs are thought to arise solely from interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), a KIT-positive population that controls gut motility. Activating gain-of-function mutations in KIT and PDGFRA are the most frequent driver events, and most of these tumors are responsive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Less common drivers include mutant BRAF Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) and hereditary hemorrhagic\\xa0telangiectasia (HHT) are both relatively rare hereditary disorders. Some patients with the SMAD4 gene mutation develop both JPS and HHT, a condition termed JPS-HHT. We herein report a case of childhood-onset JPS-HHT. At nine years old, the patient underwent colonoscopy under suspicion of Crohn\\'s disease, which revealed multiple polyps. A genetic analysis for familial adenomatous polyposis and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome found no mutations. After several years, extraintestinal manifestations, such as repeated epistaxis and several telangiectasias in the upper palate and stomach, were identified, which led to the performance of gene mutation analysis for SMAD4. As a result, a missense mutation in exon 8, codon 361 from arginine to cysteine (c.1081 C>T) was found. Based on this finding, the patient underwent cerebral magnetic resonance angiography, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy and thoracoabdominal contrast computed tomography. The examination revealed that she had pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas and arteriovenous malformations in both the liver and right mammary gland. Thus, continuous surveillance for vascular lesions and gastrointestinal cancer is scheduled. Making a precise diagnosis of JPS-HHT can lead to the detection of asymptomatic complications and enable appropriate future disease management. Schwannomas are neurogenic tumors that arise from Schwann cells in the neural sheath. Gastrointestinal schwannomas occur most often in the stomach, followed by the colon and the rectum. Duodenal schwannomas are rare amongst mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and only a few cases have been reported up to the current date with an incidence of approximately 2%-6%. Duodenal Schwannomas do not have characteristic imaging features thereby cannot be easily differentiated from other submucosal and adjacent extraluminal neoplasms. We present a case of a 76-year old male patient that presented to our hospital with abdominal pain and was diagnosed after an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with an ampullary duodenal neoplasm that proved to be a periampullary duodenal Schwannoma on histopathology. Duodenal Schwannomas although rare should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ampullary neoplasms. To establish a primary human gastric cancer cell line.\\nFresh gastric cancer tissue samples were separated into a cell suspension, and DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum was used for primary culture and subculture. The morphology of the cells was observed under a light microscope, and the cell growth curve was plotted. A soft agar colony formation assay was used to detect the colony formation ability of the cell line. Immunohistochemical methods were used to detect cytokeratin, vimentin and Ki-67, the chromosome G banding method was used to analyse the karyotype of the cells, and the tumourigenic ability of the cells was detected by subcutaneous inoculation of BALB/C nude mice.\\nWe established a gastric cancer cell line from a 68-year-old male patient. This gastric cancer cell line was named XGC-1 and had a doubling time of approximately 48\\xa0h. The cell line displayed strong colony formation ability and tumourigenicity in BALB/C nude mice and had complicated chromosomal abnormalities. When nutrients were insufficient, the cells shed and floated in the medium, but adherent growth was observed in nutrient-rich conditions.\\nThe XGC-1 cell line will be useful for future studies of gastric cancer development, progression, metastasis and therapy. Non-curative resection (NCR) remains problematic in some cases of early gastric carcinomas (EGCs) treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The aim of this study was to identify predictors of NCR, especially of eCura C1 and eCura C2 resections, before ESD and study long-term outcomes of EGC patients with NCR.\\nA retrospective review of medical records was conducted over an 8-year period for EGCs undergoing ESD. Clinicopathologic and endoscopic characteristics and patients\\' survival were analyzed. Risk factors for NCR and eCura C1 and C2 resections were assessed by logistic analyses. Survival of patients was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method with a Log rank test.\\nA total of 463 patients with 472 lesions were qualified. By univariate and multivariate analyses, the predictors for NCR and eCura C2 resections were tumor size >20 mm, tumors located in cardia-fundus, uneven surface, margin elevation, and mixed and undifferentiated types, and those for eCura C1 resection were tumors located in cardia-fundus, negative lifting sign, and mixed and undifferentiated types. The 5-year cancer-specific and cancer-free survival rates were 100.0% and 94.2%, and 95.3% and 83.4% in the curative resection (CR) and NCR groups, respectively. The 5-year cancer-specific and cancer-free survival rates were significantly greater in the CR group than that in the NCR group (\\nIn this cohort, we identified various endoscopic and pathologic features of EGCs to predict NCR, especially eCura C1 and eCura C2 resections before ESD. These clinically valuable factors would be very informative to endoscopists and surgeons who perform ESD to resect EGCs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to participate in many biological processes and severs as important regulators during the progression of gastric cancer.\\nHere, we introduced human lncRNA SNHG15 which was highly expressed in gastric cancer and cells. Interestingly, the expression of SNHG15 was correlated with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which promotes the resistance of gastric cancer cells to immune responses. Meanwhile, SNHG15 downregulation suppressed the expression of PD-L1 and resistance of immune responses.\\nFurther, our results suggested that SNHG15 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) to sponge miR-141, which was downregulated in gastric cancers and negatively correlated to PD-L1.\\nOur results suggested that SNHG15 improved the expression of PD-L1 by inhibiting miR-141, which in turn promoted the resistance of stomach cancer cells to the immune responses. Crawling-type adenocarcinoma (CRA) is an important gastric cancer (GC) subtype that exhibits a specific histological pattern and has characteristic clinicopathological findings. Despite its characteristic histology, little is known about the molecular characteristics of CRA.\\nWe examined 177 GC cases, including 51 cases of CRA and 126 cases having conventional differentiated adenocarcinomas (CDAs). Results for immunohistochemistry (mucin phenotype; Muc5AC, Muc6, Muc2 and CD10, CDX-2, MLH-1, p53 and β-catenin), mutation analysis (TP53, KRAS and BRAF), microsatellite instability (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250), DNA methylation status by a two-panel method (RUNX3, MINT31, LOX, NEUROG1, ELMO1 and THBD), MLH-1 promoter methylation, and allelic imbalance (AI; 1p, 3p, 4p, 5q, 8p, 9p, 13q, TP53, 18q and 22q) were examined.\\nCRAs were more likely to occur in the middle third of the stomach, in younger patients and to be macroscopically depressed. Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and loss of MLH-1 expression were less frequent among CRA cases compared to CDA cases. At a molecular level, CRA is often characterized by the deletion mutation c.529_546 (18-base pair deletion at codon 177-182 in exon 5) in the TP53 gene (10 cases). Although the low methylation epigenotype was significantly more frequent for CRAs compared to CDAs, multiple AIs were more often seen in CRAs relative to CDAs.\\nThe results demonstrated that TP53 mutations, particularly c.529_546del, and multiple AIs are closely associated with CRA carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that CRA is an independent entity of GC in terms of clinicopathologic and molecular findings. Gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer are among the most common cancers in Poland. Cancer patients usually assess their quality of life much worse than the general population, while negative emotions associated with the illness may affect the results of treatment.\\nThe study involved 378 patients with colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer, treated as outpatients at the Oncology Center - Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute in Warsaw in 2013-2018. Standardized tools were used in the study: the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire (BPCQ), the Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), Approval Illness Scale (AIS), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MiniMAC). The main goal of the study was to assess pain control, pain management strategies, illness acceptance and adaptation to cancer in patients with the most common gastrointestinal cancers.\\nPatients with gastrointestinal cancers ascribe the greatest role in controlling pain to internal factors (M\\u2009=\\u200916.84, SE\\u2009=\\u2009.34), and the highest score in this area was obtained by patients with colorectal cancer (M\\u2009=\\u200917.33, SE\\u2009=\\u2009.35). The most frequently chosen strategy is declaring coping (M\\u2009=\\u200920.95, SE\\u2009=\\u2009.57), although patients with pancreatic cancer obtained a high score also in the area of catastrophizing (M\\u2009=\\u200917.99, SE\\u2009=\\u20091.14). The average value of illness acceptance for patients with gastrointestinal cancers was M\\u2009=\\u200925.00 (SE\\u2009=\\u2009.50) and it was the lowest in the group of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (M\\u2009=\\u200923.41, SE\\u2009=\\u20091.16), and the highest in a group of people with colorectal cancer (M\\u2009=\\u200927.76, SE\\u2009=\\u2009.51). Patients with gastrointestinal cancers obtained the highest values of the MiniMAC test in the area of the fighting spirit (M\\u2009=\\u200921.30, SE\\u2009=\\u2009.25), characteristic mainly for patients with colorectal cancer. Patients with pancreatic cancer were characterized by high anxiety and helplessness/hopelessness.\\nPatients with gastrointestinal cancers use different methods of pain control and pain coping strategies, with active behaviors being preferred by patients with colorectal cancer and destructive - by patients with pancreatic cancer. The majority of socio-economic variables, as well as the treatment method, affect the patients\\' behaviors. Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-producing neuroendocrine tumor arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The detection of these tumors is extremely important because they are associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Progress in molecular genetics has revealed that up to 35% of pheochromocytomas are inhereted. Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolypous colorectal cancer - HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that is associated with a high risk of colorectal cancer or other extracolonic tumors (adenocarcinoma of endometrium, stomach, ovarian carcinoma, carcinoma of urinary tract, small intestine, brain tumors and skin cancer). Foreign medical journals are reporting an increasing number of cases on coexistence of HNPCC and neuroendocrine tumors, including pheochromocytoma. It increases the likelihood that this type of tumor could represent an additional extracolonic manifestation of Lynch syndrome. \\u2002Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at increased risk of developing gastric adenomas. There is limited understanding of their clinical course and no consensus on management. We reviewed the management of gastric adenomas in patients with FAP from two centers.\\nPatients with FAP and histologically confirmed gastric adenomas were identified between 1997 and 2018. Patient demographics, adenoma characteristics, and management/surveillance outcomes were collected.\\n\\u2002Of 726 patients with FAP, 104 (14\\u200a%; 49 female) were diagnosed with gastric adenomas at a median age of 47 years (range 19\\u200a-\\u200a80). The median size of gastric adenomas was 6\\u200amm (range 1.5\\u200a-\\u200a50); 64 (62\\u200a%) patients had adenomas located distally to the incisura. Five patients (5\\u200a%) had gastric adenomas demonstrating high-grade dysplasia (HGD) on initial diagnosis, distributed equally within the stomach. The risk of HGD was associated with adenoma size (\\n\\u2002We observed gastric adenomas in 14\\u200a% of patients with FAP. Of these, 5\\u200a% contained HGD; risk of HGD correlated with adenoma size. Endoscopic resection was feasible, with few complications and low recurrence rates, but did not completely eliminate the cancer risk. Dosimetric measurement error is known to potentially bias the magnitude of the dose response, and can also affect the shape of dose response. In this report, generalized relative and absolute rate models are fitted to the latest Japanese atomic bomb survivor solid cancer, leukemia and circulatory disease mortality data (followed from 1950 through 2003), with the latest (DS02R1) dosimetry, using Bayesian techniques to adjust for errors in dose estimates and assessing other model uncertainties. Linear-quadratic models are fitted and used to assess lifetime mortality risks for contemporary UK, USA, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese populations. For a test dose of 0.1 Gy absorbed dose weighted by neutron relative biological effectiveness, solid cancer, leukemia and circulatory disease mortality risks for a UK population using a generalized linear-quadratic relative rate model were estimated to be 3.88% Gy-1 [95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 1.17, 6.97], 0.35% Gy-1 (95% BCI: -0.03, 0.78) and 2.24% Gy-1 (95% BCI: -0.17, 13.76), respectively. Using a generalized absolute rate linear-quadratic model at 0.1 Gy, the lifetime risks for these three end points were estimated to be 3.56% Gy-1 (95% BCI: 0.54, 6.78), 0.41% Gy-1 (95% BCI: 0.01, 0.86) and 1.56% Gy-1 (95% BCI: -1.10, 7.21), respectively. There was substantial evidence of curvature for solid cancer (in particular, the group of solid cancers excluding lung, breast and stomach cancers) and leukemia, so that for solid cancer and leukemia, estimates of excess risk per unit dose were nearly doubled by increasing the dose from 0.01 to 1.0 Gy, with most of the increase occurring in the interval from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy. For circulatory disease, the dose-response curvature was inverse, so that risk per unit dose was nearly halved by going from 0.01 t o 1.0 Gy weighted absorbed dose, although there were substantial uncertainties. In general, there were higher radiation risks for females compared to males. This was true for solid cancer and circulatory disease overall, as well as for lung, breast, stomach and the group of other solid cancers, and was the case whether relative or absolute rate projection models were employed; however, for leukemia this pattern was reversed. Risk estimates varied somewhat between populations, with lower cancer risks in aggregate for China and Russia, but higher circulatory disease risks for Russia, particularly using the relative rate model. There was more pronounced variation for certain cancer sites and certain types of projection models, so that breast cancer risk was markedly lower in China and Japan using a relative rate model, but the opposite was the case for stomach cancer. There was less variation between countries using the absolute rate models for stomach cancer and breast cancer, but this was not the case for lung cancer and the group of other solid cancers, or for circulatory disease. The main cause of gastric cancer is the infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori which induces a chronic inflammation and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) leading to the emergence of cells with cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized. Moreover, H. pylori modulates the host cell autophagic process, but a few studies have investigated the role of this process in tumoral transformation. The aim of this study was to determine whether H. pylori-induced autophagy has a role in CSC emergence.\\nAutophagic flux in response to H. pylori infection was characterized in AGS cell line expressing the tandem-tagged mCherry-GFP-LC3 protein and using a ratiometric flow cytometry analysis. Then, AGS and MKN45 cell lines were treated with bafilomycin or chloroquine, two pharmaceutical well-known inhibitors of autophagy, and different EMT and CSC characteristics were analyzed.\\nFirst, a co-expression of the gastric CSC marker CD44 and the autophagic marker LC3 in mice and human stomach tissues infected with H.\\xa0pylori was observed. Then, we demonstrated in vitro that H.\\xa0pylori was able to activate the autophagy process with a reduced autophagic flux. Finally, infected cells were treated with autophagy inhibitors, which reduced (i) appearance of mesenchymal phenotypes and migration ability related to EMT and (ii) CD44 expression as well as tumorsphere formation capacities reflecting CSC properties.\\nIn conclusion, all these data show that H.\\xa0pylori-induced autophagy is implicated in gastric CSC emergence and could represent an interesting therapeutic target. To evaluate cost-effectiveness of a novel screening strategy using a microRNA (miRNA) blood test as a screen, followed by endoscopy for diagnosis confirmation in a 3-yearly population screening program for gastric cancer.\\nA Markov cohort model has been developed in Microsoft Excel 2016 for the population identified to be at intermediate risk (Singaporean men, aged 50-75 years with Chinese ethnicity). The interventions compared were (1) initial screening using miRNA test followed by endoscopy for test-positive individuals and a 3-yearly follow-up screening for test-negative individuals (proposed strategy), and (2) no screening with gastric cancer being diagnosed clinically (current practice). The model was evaluated for 25 years with a healthcare perspective and accounted for test characteristics, compliance, disease progression, cancer recurrence, costs, utilities, and mortality. The outcomes measured included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cancer stage at diagnosis, and thresholds for significant variables.\\nThe miRNA-based screening was found to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40 971/quality-adjusted life-year. Key drivers included test costs, test accuracy, cancer incidence, and recurrence risk. Threshold analysis highlights the need for high accuracy of miRNA tests (threshold sensitivity: 68%; threshold specificity: 77%). A perfect compliance to screening would double the cancer diagnosis in early stages compared to the current practice. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis reported the miRNA-based screening to be cost-effective in >95% of iterations for a willingness to pay of $70 000/quality-adjusted life-year (approximately equivalent to 1 gross domestic product/capita) CONCLUSIONS: The miRNA-based screening intervention was found to be cost-effective and is expected to contribute immensely in early diagnosis of cancer by improving screening compliance.  Determining the site of origin of a metastatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) can be challenging and has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. An immunohistochemical (IHC) panel consisting of TTF1, CDX2, PAX8/PAX6 and Islet1 is often employed. However, there can be a significant IHC overlap among different primary sites. Herein, we sought to determine the utility of including Special AT-rich sequence binding protein-2 (SATB2) in the IHC panel that is used for determining the site of origin of a metastatic NET.\\nParaffin tissue microarrays consisting of 137 primary NETs (26 lung, 22 jejunoileal, 8 appendix, 5 stomach, 4 duodenum, 17 rectum and 55 pancreas) were stained for SATB2, in addition to the well-described lineage-associated markers, such as TTF1, CDX2, PAX6 and Islet1. Additionally, a tissue microarray consisting of 21 metastatic NETs (1 lung, 1 stomach, 8 jejunoileal and 11 pancreas) was stained for TTF1, CDX2, SATB2 and Islet1. The results were recorded as no staining, weak staining and moderate to strong staining.\\nAll appendiceal NETs and majority (88%) of the rectal NETs were positive for SATB2. All primary foregut NETs (stomach, pancreas, duodenum and lung) were negative for SATB2, except for one pulmonary NET with weak staining. However, among the metastatic tumours, 5 of 11 pancreatic NETs, 1 stomach NET, 1 lung NET and 2 of 8 jejunoileal NETs showed weak staining. Receiver operating characteristic analysis incorporating sensitivity and specificity data of IHC panel, considering moderate to strong staining as truly positive cases, showed that inclusion of SATB2 to the previously described NET IHC panel outperformed the panel without SATB2, raising the specificity for pancreaticoduodenal NETs from 81.2% to 100%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 82.22% (p<0.0001); for appendiceal NETs the specificity changed from 99.1% to 98.5% and sensitivity increased from 11.8% to 80%, with a PPV and NPV of 66.67% and 99.26%, respectively (p<0.0001); and for rectal NETs the specificity increased from 97.6% to 99.3% and sensitivity raised from 7.1% to 66.7%, with a PPV and NPV of 80% and 98.53%, respectively (p<0.0001).\\nSATB2 stain is useful in differentiatingIslet1/PAX6 positive pancreatic and rectal NETs, as rectal NETs are typically moderately to strongly positive for SATB2 and pancreatic NETs are usually negative or weakly positive for SATB2. Moderate to strong staining for SATB2 is suggestive of an appendiceal or a rectal primary. SATB2 may complement the panel of CDX2, TTF1 and Islet1 in determining the site of origin of an NET in a metastatic setting. Cancers accumulate mutations that lead to neoantigens, novel peptides that elicit an immune response, and consequently undergo evolutionary selection. Here we establish how negative selection shapes the clonality of neoantigens in a growing cancer by constructing a mathematical model of neoantigen evolution. The model predicts that, without immune escape, tumor neoantigens are either clonal or at low frequency; hypermutated tumors can only establish after the evolution of immune escape. Moreover, the site frequency spectrum of somatic variants under negative selection appears more neutral as the strength of negative selection increases, which is consistent with classical neutral theory. These predictions are corroborated by the analysis of neoantigen frequencies and immune escape in exome and RNA sequencing data from 879 colon, stomach and endometrial cancers. The impact of alcohol drinking on gastric precancerous lesions remains unclear. We investigated the relationship of alcohol intake with risk of atrophic gastritis (AG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM).\\nThis study included 202,675 Korean adults free from AG and IM on their initial endoscopy who were followed with repeated endoscopic examinations. A parametric proportional hazards model was used to estimate the adjusted HR (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident AG and IM based on endoscopic diagnosis.\\nDuring a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, 64,853 incident AG cases and 4,536 IM cases were identified. Alcohol consumption including drinking frequency, quantity, and binge drinking were consistently associated with increased risk of both AG and IM in a dose-response manner. After adjustment for confounders, the multivariable aHRs (95% CIs) for incident IM comparing average alcohol intake of <10, 10-<20, 20-<40, and ≥40 g/day with lifetime abstainers were 1.27 (1.02-1.56), 1.34 (1.07-1.66), 1.50 (1.20-1.86), and 1.54 (1.23-1.93), respectively. Former drinkers were also at a higher risk for AG and IM compared with lifetime abstainers. These associations were consistently observed in never smokers and in time-dependent analyses.\\nIn a large cohort of Korean individuals, alcohol intake even at low levels was independently associated with increased risk of developing endoscopic AG and IM, supporting a role of alcohol consumption in the pathogenesis of AG and IM, the precursor lesions of stomach cancer.\\nAlcohol consumption from low-level drinking may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. None Germ cell cancer (GCC) is a group of neoplasms with heterogeneity. Predominant in young adults, GCC potentially mitigates a high number of productive years of life lost. Indeed, long-term side effects have arisen as a problem in GCC survivors, especially in adolescent and young adult (AYA) subgroup. The objective of this study is to delineate survival and second primary malignancies (SPMs) in AYA patients with GCC.\\nWe used US population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 18 Regs Custom Data (1976-2016 varying) and SEER 9 Regs Research Data, November 2019 Sub (1975-2017) for survival analysis and SPM analysis, respectively.\\nOverall, 5-, 10- and 20-year overall survival rates for AYA patients with GCC were 93%, 91.3%, and 86.9%, respectively. Compared with the general population, a significantly higher risk of SPMs was observed in multiple sites, especially stomach, (standardized incidence ratio [SIR]\\u202f=\\u202f2.94), pancreas (SIR\\u202f=\\u202f3.72), intrahepatic bile duct (SIR\\u202f=\\u202f3.12), soft tissue including heart (SIR\\u202f=\\u202f4.65), leukemia (SIR\\u202f=\\u202f3.70), and testis (SIR\\u202f=\\u202f562.18). The excess risks to develop leukemia were even higher in those with primary mediastinal GCC (SIR\\u202f=\\u202f69.50, P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval\\u202f=\\u202f30.00-136.94). Multivariate analysis indicated age of diagnosis, primary site, race, receipt of radiotherapy, and histological subtype independently correlated with risk of SPMs.\\nThe present study provides risk factors of SPM in AYA patients with GCC, which could facilitate the individualization of long-term surveillance in this population. Very few proteins encoded by the presumed non-coding RNA transcripts have been identified. Their cellular functions remain largely unknown. This study identifies the tumor-suppressor function of a novel microprotein encoded by the precursor of miR-34a. It consists of 133 amino acid residues, thereby named as miPEP133 (pri-microRNA encoded peptide 133).\\nWe overexpressed miPEP133 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), ovarian cancer and cervical cancer cell lines to determine its effects on cell growth, apoptosis, migration, or invasion. Its impact on tumor growth was evaluated in a xenograft NPC model. Its prognostic value was analyzed using NPC clinical samples. We also conducted western blot, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to determine the underlying mechanisms of miPEP133 function and regulation.\\nmiPEP133 was expressed in normal human colon, stomach, ovary, uterus and pharynx. It was downregulated in cancer cell lines and tumors. miPEP133 overexpression induced apoptosis in cancer cells and inhibited their migration and invasion. miPEP133 inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Low miPEP133 expression was an unfavorable prognostic marker associated with advanced metastatic NPC. Wild-type p53 but not mutant p53 induced miPEP133 expression. miPEP133 enhanced p53 transcriptional activation and miR-34a expression. miPEP133 localized in the mitochondria to interact with mitochondrial heat shock protein 70kD (HSPA9) and prevent HSPA9 from interacting with its binding partners, leading to the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial mass.\\nmiPEP133 is a tumor suppressor localized in the mitochondria. It is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for multiple types of cancers. Currently, adjuvant therapy is not recommended for patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer (TESCC) after radical surgery, and a proportion of these patients go on to develop locoregional recurrence (LRR) within 2\\u2009years. Besides, there is no evidence for salvage chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with residual tumor after esophagectomy (R1/R2 resection). In addition, factors like different failure patterns and relationship with normal organs influence the decision for salvage strategy. Here, we aimed to design a modularized salvage CRT strategy for patients without a chance of salvage surgery according to different failure patterns (including R1/R2 resection), and further evaluated its efficacy and safety.\\nOur study was designed as a one arm, multicenter, prospective clinical trial. All enrolled patients were stratified in a stepwise manner based on the nature of surgery (R0 or R1/2), recurrent lesion diameter, involved regions, and time-to-recurrence, and were further assigned to undergo either elective nodal irradiation or involved field irradiation. Then, radiation technique and dose prescription were modified according to the distance from the recurrent lesion to the thoracic stomach or intestine. Ultimately, four treatment plans were established.\\nThis prospective study provided high-level evidence for clinical salvage management in patients with TESCC who developed LRR after radical surgery or those who underwent R1/R2 resection.\\nProspectively Registered. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03731442 , Registered November 6, 2018.   The actual incidence of small gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) increases gradually. Although the biological behavior of most of small GIST is benign or indolent, a few small GIST can develope to recurrence and metastasis with biological invasive behavior. Identification of biological behavior and malignant potential is the cornerstone of treatment. For non-gastric small GIST, surgery is always the treatment of choice. Regarding gastric small GIST, close follow-up is acceptable for patients without risk factors detected by endoscopic ultrasonography. Surgery should be suggested for those with high risks, or significant growth of tumor during follow-up. Complete resection with function preservation is the principle of surgery. Besides, individualized treatment should also be taken into consideration.\\n小胃肠间质瘤（小GIST，肿瘤直径<2 cm）检出率逐渐增多。尽管大多数小GIST在临床上呈良性或惰性表现，但确有少数病例显示出侵袭性行为，甚至可能伴随复发转移。鉴别小GIST的生物学行为和恶性潜能，是规范化治疗GIST的前提。对于非胃来源小GIST，一经发现即建议切除治疗；对于胃小GIST，在没有超声内镜提示高危因素的条件下，可以选择密切随访观察；若超声内镜提示有高危因素或随访过程中直径增大者，建议切除治疗。在完整切除的基础上，尽可能地保留功能，仍然是小GIST的治疗原则。在此基础上，需谨慎地选择个体化的治疗策略。. Rat models of duodenogastric reflux have been used to study gastric stump cancer (GSC), but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Unlike rats, mice can be genetically modified, providing a superior model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying GSC development, which is associated with duodenogastric reflux. This study aimed at developing a mouse model of duodenogastric reflux.\\nC57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the control (n\\xa0=\\xa06), sham operation (n\\xa0=\\xa09), or gastrojejunostomy group (n\\xa0=\\xa012). Mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, and 6\\xa0months after surgery. Stomach tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Lesions were classified as chronic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, or atypical hyperplasia.\\nNine mice underwent gastrojejunostomy without mortality. The animals in the gastrojejunostomy group exhibited chronic inflammation at 1, 3, and 6\\xa0months after surgery, showing intestinal metaplasia (n\\xa0=\\xa02) and atypical hyperplasia (n\\xa0=\\xa01) at 3\\xa0months and intestinal metaplasia (n\\xa0=\\xa02) and atypical hyperplasia (n\\xa0=\\xa02) at 6\\xa0months. The mice in the control group did not exhibit chronic inflammation or intestinal metaplasia, whereas those in the sham operation group exhibited chronic inflammation at 1, 3, and 6\\xa0months after surgery, without intestinal metaplasia or atypical hyperplasia. Intestinal metaplasia or atypical hyperplasia were more common in the gastrojejunostomy group than in the sham operation group (p\\xa0=\\xa00.012).\\nA duodenogastric reflux mouse model can be created using gastrojejunostomy without gastrectomy. Radioiodine therapy using oral administration of Iodine-131 (I) is a widespread employed strategy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Such a therapy requires well-trained staff, equipment and procedures regarding radiation safety. The aims of this work are to report an incidental experience of radioprotection with a 370 MBq sodium [I] iodide capsule, which arose following vomiting one minute after the oral administration in a nuclear medicine department and assessment of capsule leakage in a stomach like environment by in vitro experiment. Measurements of the radiation dose rate at the different steps of the decontamination procedure were performed and management of the situation described. Dose rate in vomit was 113 µSv/h [directional dose equivalent H\\'(0.07)] after capsule withdrawal and was decreased by 10 times after the first decontamination attempt. To evaluate the I release following administration to the patient, an in vitro experiment was designed to recap capsules degradation in a stomach like environment including acidic solution (pH 1) and temperature at 35-37°c. A significant release of I (<6%) was observed in the first 2 min of the in vitro experiment. Sodium [I] iodide capsules disruption occurred at 150 s for capsule 1 and 133 s for capsule 2. Incidental contamination with I in the clinics is of important concern in nuclear medicine and precautions that allow optimization and pertinent management of the situation should be known by the nuclear medicine and radioprotection community. This study aims to identify differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in gastric cancer by comparing gastric cancerous tissues with normal tissues, explore the potential roles.The miRNA expression microarray was employed on gastric cancer tissues, and apparently normal para-cancerous tissues from 3 patients undergoing radical surgery were matched. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the other 7 patients to validate the findings of the microarray. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and enrichment analysis of KEGG Pathway were performed for 5 dysregulated candidate miRNAs, including 3 upregulated (miR-31-3p, miR-6736-3p, and miR-147b) and 2 downregulated (miR-3065-5p and miR-3921) miRNAs, in order to determine the role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis and development.Among these miRNAs, 17 miRNAs were found to be upregulated, and 19 miRNAs were found to be downregulated. The dysregulated expression of 5 candidate miRNAs, including miR-31-3p, miR-147b, miR-6736-3p, miR-3065-5p, and miR-3921, were verified by quantitative RT-PCR in the validation set. Among these miRNAs, miR-31-3p, miR-6736-3p, miR-3065-5p, and miR-3921 had 551 target gene intersections. The GO and KEGG Pathway analyses Revealed that miR-31-3p, miR-6736-3p, miR-3065-5p, and miR-3921 may participate in multiple pathophysiological processes, such as foreign substance metabolism and chemical carcinogenesis.The profile of differentially expressed miRNAs was successfully screened, and 4 miRNAs (i.e., miR-31-3p, miR-6736-3p, miR-3065-5p, and miR-3921) appeared to be involved in gastric carcinogenesis. These might serve as promising biomarkers for gastric cancer. The association between height and risk of gastric cancer has been studied in several epidemiological studies with contrasting results. The aim of this study is to examine the association between adult height and gastric cancer within a large pooled analysis of case-control studies members of the Stomach cancer Pooling (StoP) Project consortium.\\nData from 18 studies members of the StoP consortium were collected and analyzed. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between 10-cm increase in height and risk of gastric cancer. Age, sex, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, social class, geographical area and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status were included in the regression model. Resulting estimates were then pooled with random-effect model. Analyses were conducted overall and in strata of selected variables.\\nA total of 7562 cases and 19 033 controls were included in the analysis. The pooled OR was 0.96 (95% CI 0.87-1.05). A sensitivity analysis was performed restricting the results to the studies with information on H. pylori status, resulting in an OR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.79-1.20).\\nOur study does not support a strong and consistent association between adult height and gastric cancer. Utilizing a standardized dataset based on a newly developed list of 27 univocally defined complications, this study analyzed data to assess the incidence and grading of complications and evaluate outcomes associated with gastrectomy for cancer in Europe.\\nThe absence of a standardized system for recording gastrectomy-associated complications makes it difficult to compare results from different hospitals and countries.\\nUsing a secure online platform (www.gastrodata.org), referral centers for gastric cancer in 11 European countries belonging to the Gastrectomy Complications Consensus Group recorded clinical, oncological, and surgical data, and outcome measures at hospital discharge and at 30 and 90 days postoperatively. This retrospective observational study included all consecutive resections over a 2-year period.\\nA total of 1349 gastrectomies performed between January 2017 and December 2018 were entered into the database. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 577 patients (42.8%). Total (46.1%) and subtotal (46.4%) gastrectomy were the predominant resections. D2 or D2+ lymphadenectomy was performed in almost 80% of operations. The overall complications\\' incidence was 29.8%; 402 patients developed 625 complications, with the most frequent being nonsurgical infections (23%), anastomotic leak (9.8%), other postoperative abnormal fluid from drainage and/or abdominal collections (9.3%), pleural effusion (8.3%), postoperative bleeding (5.6%), and other major complications requiring invasive treatment (5.6%). The median Clavien-Dindo score and Comprehensive Complications Index were IIIa and 26.2, respectively. In-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality were 3.2%, 3.6%, and 4.5%, respectively.\\nThe use of a standardized platform to collect European data on perioperative complications revealed that gastrectomy for gastric cancer is still associated with heavy morbidity and mortality. Actions are needed to limit the incidence of, and to effectively treat, the most frequent and most lethal complications. Identification of the primary site of cancer is essential for the treatment of patients with cancer. Numerous immunohistochemical markers have been developed to determine the differentiation of tumor cells and suggest possible primary sites, but markers of gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinomas are still lacking. Claudin-18 is a tight-junction protein uniquely expressed in gastric epithelial cells and has been shown to be expressed in gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Whether claudin-18 can be used as a marker for identifying the primary site of cancer is still unclear. In this study, we used the immunohistochemical method to stain claudin-18 in tissue arrays containing 575 carcinomas from different anatomic sites and representative sections of 157 metastatic adenocarcinomas. In the group of primary tumors, claudin-18 was frequently expressed in gastric, pancreatic, and pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinomas. Half of cholangiocarcinomas and ovarian mucinous carcinomas and some colorectal and pulmonary adenocarcinomas were also positive for claudin-18. In the metastatic cohort, 15 of 17 (88%) gastric adenocarcinomas, 18 of 23 (78%) pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and 4 of 7 (57%) cholangiocarcinomas and gallbladder adenocarcinomas were positive for claudin-18. Only 4 tumors that originated outside the stomach and pancreatobiliary tract were positive for claudin-18. After normalization to the tumor frequency, the sensitivity of claudin-18 for identifying the stomach and pancreatobiliary tract as primary tumor sites was 79%, and the specificity was 93%. The positive and negative predictive values were 76% and 94%, respectively. In conclusion, claudin-18 represents a sensitive and specific marker for stomach and pancreatobiliary adenocarcinoma that may be a useful diagnostic tool in routine surgical pathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and mechanism of miR-17 in gastric lym-phoma. miR-17mimics, miR-17 inhibitors and negative controls were transfected into human gastric lymphoma cell line cyp6d. The proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of cyp6d cells were detected by CCK-8, Transwell and TUNEL methods, respectively. The expression and clinicopathological features of miR-17 in gastric lymphoma were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. The target gene of miR-17 was predicted by targetscan 7.2, and the expression of miR-17 related protein was detected by Western blot. The results showed that the expression of miR-17 in gastric lymphoma was significantly higher than that in normal tissues (P < 0.05), which was closely related to lymph node metastasis, tumor size and distant metastasis (P < 0.05). The high expression of miR-17 significantly promoted the proliferation and invasion of cyp6d cells and inhibited apoptosis (P < 0.05). The high expression of miR-17 can regu¬late the expression of HSP60 and TNFR2. It has been found that miR-17 can promote the development of gastric lymphoma by regulating HSP60/TNFR2 pathway, which is a potential molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric lymphoma. Ingestible electronic devices enable noninvasive evaluation and diagnosis of pathologies in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but generally cannot therapeutically interact with the tissue wall. Here, we report the development of an orally administered electrical stimulation device characterized in ex vivo human tissue and in in vivo swine models, which transiently anchored itself to the stomach by autonomously inserting electrically conductive, hooked probes. The probes provided stimulation to the tissue via timed electrical pulses that could be used as a treatment for gastric motility disorders. To demonstrate interaction with stomach muscle tissue, we used the electrical stimulation to induce acute muscular contractions. Pulses conductively signaled the probes\\' successful anchoring and detachment events to a parenterally placed device. The ability to anchor into and electrically interact with targeted GI tissues controlled by the enteric nervous system introduces opportunities to treat a multitude of associated pathologies.  Patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer (GC) can benefit from the addition of trastuzumab. However, not all patients with HER2-positive GC respond to trastuzumab. Biomarkers affecting its efficacy in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) are largely unknown. Therefore, classifying GC into molecularly distinct subtypes to accurately distinguish between GC patients who would and would not benefit from trastuzumab is worthwhile. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a notable feature in GC and whether TMB influences trastuzumab efficacy is still unknown. Herein, we report the case of a 61-yearold man who was diagnosed with metastatic HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma that had spread to the liver (T4aN0M1, stage IV). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a circular ulcer in the posterior wall of the stomach. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 2-cm diameter liver metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis of the endoscopic biopsy tumor revealed 3+ positive expression for HER2. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the tumor tissue revealed 3,736 somatic mutations in 2,423 genes and a very high TMB of 50.3 mutations/Mb. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the patient had mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) GC. The patient received first-line trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy, and after 2 courses of sequential metronomic trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy, restaging CT showed that the liver metastasis had disappeared. Following resection, the patient had no recurrence and no new tumor metastasis after a follow-up of period nearly 7 years. This study is the first to report that pMMR GC with a high TMB has a favorable response to trastuzumab. The combination of HER2 positivity and a high TMB may be sufficiently predictive of sensitivity to trastuzumab in AGC. Prediction of remnant tumor is important in determining subsequent treatment options for gastric cancer patients with positive resection margin (RM) after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).\\nBased on the assumption that pathologic factors, including the length and type of involved RM, could potentially predict residual tumor, we evaluated 451 ESD specimens in patients with early gastric cancer.\\nOf 408 cases, 37 (9.1 %) showed positive RMs. RM involvement in gastric cancer ESD specimens was associated with extended or beyond ESD criteria, greater tumor size, poor differentiation, submucosal invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and upper third location. Among the 37 positive RM cases, residual tumor was present in seven (18.9 %). The presence of residual tumor was not significantly associated with any clinicopathologic parameters except for tumor size and RM status. The total length of the involved RM was the most significant factor associated with the presence of residual tumor (P < 0.008). A total length cut-off value of 6 mm yielded a sensitivity of 85.7 % and negative predictive value of 94.7 % for predicting remnant tumor at gastrectomy following ESD.\\nIn conclusion, when the ESD specimen exhibits positive RM, a quantitative assessment of the involved RM should be included in the pathology report, as this can help the clinician predict remnant tumor and determine appropriate future treatment. UK primary-care referral guidance describes the signs, symptoms, and test results (\"features\") of undiagnosed cancer. Guidance revision in 2015 liberalised investigation by introducing more low-risk features. We studied adults with cancer whose features were in the 2005 guidance (\"Old-NICE\") or were introduced in the revision (\"New-NICE\"). We compared time to diagnosis between the groups, and its trend over 2006-2017.\\nClinical Practice Research Datalink records were analysed for adults with incident myeloma, breast, bladder, colorectal, lung, oesophageal, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, stomach or uterine cancers in 1/1/2006-31/12/2017. Cancer-specific features in the year before diagnosis were used to create New-NICE and Old-NICE groups. Diagnostic interval was time between the index feature and diagnosis. Semiparametric varying-coefficient analyses compared diagnostic intervals between New-NICE and Old-NICE groups over 1/1/2006-31/12/2017.\\nOver all cancers (N = 83,935), median (interquartile range) Old-NICE diagnostic interval rose over 2006-2017, from 51 (20-132) to 64 (30-148) days, with increases in breast (15 vs 25 days), lung (103 vs 135 days), ovarian (65·5 vs 100 days), prostate (80 vs 93 days) and stomach (72·5 vs 102 days) cancers. Median New-NICE values were consistently longer (99, 40-212 in 2006 vs 103, 42-236 days in 2017) than Old-NICE values over all cancers. After guidance revision, New-NICE diagnostic intervals became shorter than Old-NICE values for colorectal cancer.\\nDespite improvements for colorectal cancer, scope remains to reduce diagnostic intervals for most cancers. Liberalised investigation requires protecting and enhancing cancer-diagnostic services to avoid their becoming a rate-limiting step in the diagnostic pathway. While the chemoprevention effect of aspirin is well-established, the effects of metformin in cancer prevention is still controversial. This study is to investigate the use of aspirin, metformin, or the combination of both is associated with delayed cancer incidence.\\nThis dataset is based on the electronic medical record of public hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were classified into 1. aspirin user, 2. metformin user, 3. both aspirin and metformin user and 4. control group with neither aspirin nor metformin used. Aspirin and/or metformin must have been taken for over 6 months in the treatment group and cancer incidences was counted at least 6 months after exposure to such medications. The primary outcome of this study was overall incidence of cancer during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes were cancer incidences of specific sites, including colon/rectum, liver, oesophagus, pancreas, stomach, lung, breast, kidney, bladder and prostate. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios of cancer risks. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to control for the medication effects.\\nA total of 120,971 aspirin users, 11,365 metformin users, and 6630 aspirin plus metformin users, were identified. Compare to the control groups, those who used aspirin alone demonstrated a significant reduction in overall cancer risk (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87). Similarly, those who used metformin alone also showed an overall reduction in cancer risk (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88). Patients who received both aspirin and metformin showed the most significant reduction in overall cancer risk (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45-0.63). Metformin showed a significant reduction in cancer risk of lung, oesophagus and bladder.\\nThere is a similar decrease in overall cancer rate with the use of aspirin or metformin alone. A more significant reduction in overall cancer risk was found with the use of both agents. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and its premalignant lesion, Barrett\\'s esophagus (BE), are characterized by a strong and yet unexplained male predominance (with a male-to-female ratio in EA incidence of up to 6:1). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 susceptibility loci for these conditions. However, potential sex differences in genetic associations with BE/EA remain largely unexplored.\\nGiven strong genetic overlap, BE and EA cases were combined into a single case group for analysis. These were compared with population-based controls. We performed sex-specific GWAS of BE/EA in 3 separate studies and then used fixed-effects meta-analysis to provide summary estimates for >9 million variants for male and female individuals. A series of downstream analyses were conducted separately in male and female individuals to identify genes associated with BE/EA and the genetic correlations between BE/EA and other traits.\\nWe included 6758 male BE/EA cases, 7489 male controls, 1670 female BE/EA cases, and 6174 female controls. After Bonferroni correction, our meta-analysis of sex-specific GWAS identified 1 variant at chromosome 6q11.1 (rs112894788, KHDRBS2-MTRNR2L9, P\\nThe identified novel sex-specific variants associated with BE/EA could improve the understanding of the genetic architecture of the disease and the reasons for the male predominance. Oesophagectomy with long-segment colon reconstruction is the first-line treatment when the stomach is not available. Supercharging of the newly formed conduit can improve vascular function utilizing intraoperative perfusion imaging system, following thoracoscopic oesophagectomy for distal-oesophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of microvascular augmentation of left colonic interposition following oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer.\\nA retrospective analysis of 156 consecutive oesophagectomies between January 2016 and July 2018 was performed. All oesophagectomies involving left colon interposition with microvascular augmentation were included in the study. In all cases, oesophageal mobilization was performed thoracoscopically in prone position and the left colon was used as neo-oesophagus in an isoperistaltic fashion. Conduit perfusion was assessed with the Spy system and neck supercharging was performed using microsurgical technique.\\nA total of n = 5 (3.2%) patients were identified. Two cases had delayed and 3 had immediate reconstruction. The conduit was microsurgically augmented in 3 cases with both venous and arterial anastomoses (supercharging) and in 2 cases with venous anastomosis only (superdrainage). No anastomotic leak was identified. One case developed left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy with associated aspiration pneumonia.\\nSupercharged colonic interposition is a safe way of oesophageal reconstruction when long-segment interposition graft is needed. In oesophageal cancer and in the absence of a viable stomach with intact gastroepiploic arcade, it should be considered a feasible option with favourable outcomes, when the expertise and facilities are available. Use of intraoperative perfusion imaging reveals improved conduit blood supply post-supercharging. Chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin (Syn) and the Ki-67 index play significant roles in diagnosis or the evaluation of the proliferative activity of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). However, little is known about whether these biological markers change during tumor metastasis and whether such changes have effect on prognosis.\\nWe analyzed 35 specimens of both primary and metastatic tumor from 779 patients who had been diagnosed as GEP-NENs at Wuhan Union Hospital from August 2011 to October 2019. The heterogeneity of CgA, Syn and Ki-67 index was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis.\\nAmong these 779 patients, the three most common sites of NENs in the digestive tract were the pancreas, rectum and stomach. Metastases were found in 311 (39.9%) patients. Among the 35 patients with both primary and metastatic pathological specimens, differences in the Ki-67 level were detected in 54.3% of the patients, while 37.1% showed a difference in CgA and only 11.4% showed a difference in Syn. Importantly, due to the difference in the Ki-67 index between primary and metastatic lesions, the WHO grade was changed in 8.6% of the patients. In addition, a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with Ki-67 index variation had a shorter overall survival (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0346), while neither Syn variation nor CgA variation was related to patient survival (p\\xa0=\\u20090.7194, p\\xa0=\\u20090.4829).\\nOur data indicate that primary and metastatic sites of GEP-NENs may exhibit pathological heterogeneity. Ki-67 index variation is closely related to the poor prognosis of patients with tumor metastasis, but neither Syn variation nor CgA variation is related to patient prognosis. Therefore, clinicopathologic evaluation of the primary tumor and metastatic sites could be helpful for predicting the prognosis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) observation time is associated with detection rate of premalignant or neoplastic lesions in the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate of an institutional policy of EGD observation time on the detection rate of UGI neoplasms.\\nFrom July 2017 to March 2019, all endoscopists were requested to adhere to our institutional policy of spending more than 3 minutes of observation time in every screening EGD. Observation time was defined as the time from when the endoscope reached the duodenum to when it was withdrawn. We obtained neoplasm detection rate (NDR) during this period, which was compared with that of baseline period from 2009 to 2015.\\nDuring the study period, 30,506 EGDs were performed. The age of subjects was 49.9 ± 10.5 years, and 56.5% were male. All endoscopists achieved the average EGD observation time more than 3 minutes during this period. Mean observation time was 3:35 ± 0:50, which was significantly longer than that of baseline (2:38 ± 0:21, P<0.001). NDR was 0.33%, which was higher than that of baseline (0.23%, P<0.001). Even after adjusting for subjects\\' age and gender, smoking history, and endoscopists\\' biopsy rate, prolonged EGD observation time more than 3 minutes increased NDR of UGI neoplasms (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21 -1.75).\\nThis study provides evidence that implementing a protocol of a prolonged observation time could increase NDR. Observation time should be an important quality indicator of EGD examination. The correlation between the infection of H. pylori and the occurrence of gastric MALT lymphoma (GML) has been well documented. However, the mechanism of how GML is caused by this bacterium is not well understood, although some immunologic mechanisms are thought to be involved.\\nIn this study, we performed both transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on gastric cancer cells infected by H. pylori isolates from GML patients and the gastric ulcer strain 26695 to investigate the differentially expressed molecular signatures that were induced by GML isolates.\\nTranscriptomic analyses revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly related to binding, catalytic activity, signal transducer activity, molecular transducer activity, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity, and molecular function regulator. Fifteen pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, the mTOR signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and the Hippo signaling pathway, were revealed to be related to GML isolates. Proteomic analyses results showed that there were 116 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Most of these DEPs were associated with cancer, and 29 have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We also found 63 upstream regulators that can inhibit or activate the expression of the DEPs. Combining the proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed 12 common pathways. This study provides novel insights into H. pylori-associated GML. The DEPs we found may be good candidates for GML diagnosis and treatment.\\nThis study revealed specific pathways related to GML and potential biomarkers for GML diagnosis. Previous studies have shown elevated cancer risk in anorexia nervosa but the literature on other eating disorders (EDs) is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the association between all EDs and esophageal, stomach, and other cancers.\\nWe used a retrospective cohort design, based on a two-million randomized longitudinal health insurance dataset, a sub-dataset of Taiwan\\'s National Health Insurance Research Database. From all the potential participants aged 20\\u2009years or more, a total of 6,628 participants were enrolled, including 1,657 patients with EDs, with sex-, age-, and indexed date-matched (1:3) 4,971 controls. Each participant was individually tracked from 2000 to 2015 to identify incident cases of cancers, including esophageal cancer (EC), stomach cancer (SC), and all other cancers (AOC). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was employed to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between EDs and cancer.\\nOf the total 6,628 enrollees, 222 in 1,657 individuals with EDs and 810 in the 4,971 non-ED control individuals developed cancer (1,262.40 vs. 1,472.15 per 100,000 person-years), and the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was not statistically significant (log-rank, p = .324). However, after adjusting for covariates, the risk of EC and SC among the individuals with an ED was significantly higher, with adjusted HRs of 5.32 (95% CI: 1.07-26.49, p\\u2009<\\u2009.001) and 4.61 (95% CI: 1.91-11.14, p\\u2009<\\u2009.001), respectively. EDs were not associated with other cancers.\\nThis study provides evidence for the association between EDs and the risk for EC and SC. Further research on mechanisms and prevention is therefore needed. Extrahepatic metastasis (EHM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in 10%-15% of cases following initial treatment. The most frequent sites of EHM are the lung, lymph nodes, and bone. Gastrointestinal or brain metastasis from HCC is rarely reported. Here, we report a rare case of concurrent HCC metastases to the stomach, colon, and brain.\\nA 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol induced HCC presented with multiple intrahepatic recurrences and tumorous lesions in the stomach and ascending colon. Three years earlier, he underwent right hemihepatectomy, and 1 year ago, he had a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection for pulmonary metastasis of HCC. We decided on surgical resection of the new metastases because of massive gastric bleeding and concern for possible colonic obstruction. The patient underwent gastric wedge resection and right hemicolectomy. Two weeks later, the patient developed dysarthria and mild cognitive disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a left frontal lobe lesion, and he underwent resection of a metastatic brain tumor. Unfortunately, he died 6 weeks after the last surgery due to hepatorenal syndrome.\\nDecision of surgery was carefully recommended in this case and may extend survival in other metastatic HCC patients with well-preserved hepatic function.  We sought to examine occupational disparities in survival among Korean women diagnosed with cancer.\\nPopulation-based, registry-linkage study.\\nSouth Korea.\\nOur study population comprised female workers registered in the Korean national employment insurance programme during 1995-2000 and diagnosed with cancer between 1995 and 2008. A total of 61\\u2009110 women with cancer diagnoses was included in analysis. The occupation was categorised into four groups: (1) managers, professionals and technical workers, (2) clerks, (3) service/sales workers and (4) blue-collar workers.\\nStudy population were linked to the national death registry until 2009. HRs for mortality adjusting for age and year of diagnosis were calculated in the study sample and subgroups with 10 specific cancer sites including thyroid, breast, stomach, cervix, colon or lung cancer using managers, professionals and technical workers as the reference.\\nWomen in service/sales (HR 1.25, 95%\\u2009CI 1.15 to 1.35) and blue-collar occupations (HR 1.34, 95%\\u2009CI 1.25 to 1.44) had poorer survival for all cancer sites combined, while blue-collar workers showed poorer survival for lung (HR 1.41, 95%\\u2009CI 1.14 to 1.77), breast (HR 1.28, 95%\\u2009CI 1.06 to 1.54), cervical cancer (HR 1.42, 95%\\u2009CI 1.02 to 2.06) and non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma (HR 1.69, 95%\\u2009CI 1.09 to 2.77) compared with women in professional and managerial positions.\\nWe found substantial and significant inequalities in overall survival by the occupational group among Korean women with cancer, even in the context of universal access to cancer screening and treatment. Gastric adenocarcinoma typically metastasises to the liver, peritoneum and lung. Bone metastasises are less frequent and particularly uncommon in the distal extremities. This is an unusual case of metastatic disease in the distal phalanx mimicking the presentation of osteomyelitis. This case highlights the need to remain vigilant in patients with known cancer and to always be mindful of metastatic disease, even if the presentation is atypical. Malignant melanoma is cancer of the skin which commonly metastasises to the stomach. There have been no reported cases of emphysematous gastritis secondary to metastasis of malignant melanomas, to date. However, a 61-year-old woman with metastatic malignant melanoma of the left great toe presented to us with symptoms of severe left hypochondrium pain associated with high-grade fever, gross abdominal distension and recurrent vomiting. Two months earlier, metastasis was observed to have spread to the stomach and inguinal lymph nodes. At this stage, the patient opted for traditional medication instead of definitive surgery and chemotherapy. Radiological imaging revealed an emphysematous change to the stomach which was radiologically consistent with gastric malignant melanoma. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to this rare condition. A 54-year-old man presented with easy fatiguability, dyspnoea on exertion and dyspeptic symptoms. On evaluation, he was found to have an ulcero-proliferative growth in the gastric fundus, the biopsy of which was malignant melanoma of the stomach. Further evaluation with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) scan showed operable disease with no focus of disease elsewhere. He was diagnosed as primary gastric melanoma and underwent radical total gastrectomy with adequate margins. His postoperative period was uneventful. Further adjuvant therapy was refused by the patient. At 6-month follow-up, an 18F-FDG PET-CT scan was done, which showed no evidence of disease. On follow-up at 1-year, he was alive and asymptomatic. None None A 40-year-old woman with follicular thyroid cancer underwent a systemic PET/CT evaluation before operation and then received total thyroidectomy and radioactive I ablation therapy. Posttreatment imaging of I whole-body scan with SPECT/CT showed that metastasis on the spleen-stomach space coexists with mimicking subcutaneous metastasis, considering their level of I accumulation and morphological changes on PET/CT. However, histopathology confirmed the subcutaneous lesion of fibrous hyperplasia by fine-needle aspiration. This case demonstrates a vital role of SPECT/CT in the diagnosis of metastatic thyroid cancer and mimicking metastasis. Accumulated evidence indicates laparoscopic surgery (LS) has the advantages of less wound pain, less blood loss, shorter hospitalization, and faster functional recovery than open surgery (OS). Previous studies have analyzed the advantages of LS based on hospital data. This study is the first to compare surgical outcomes and health economic data using nationwide administrative claims datasets for gastric cancer.\\nThe claims datasets of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service for patients that underwent gastrectomy from May 2012 to April 2017 were analyzed. A total of 76,445 cases (LS, 42,395 and OS, 34,050) were included. Postoperative complications and medical costs were included in the analysis.\\nWe analyzed 76,445 cases of gastrectomy. Analysis showed LS was associated with fewer surgical wound infections (2,114 [6.21%] \\nThe study confirms the clinical benefits of LS over OS for gastrectomy in terms of fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stays. However, the average medical cost of LS was higher than that of OS. Multiple primary malignancies are defined as the presence of more than one malignant neoplasm with a distinct histology occurring at different sites in the same individual. They are classified as synchronous or metachronous according to the diagnostic time interval of different malignancies. Diagnosis of multiple primary malignancies should avoid misclassification from multifocal/multicentric tumors or recurrent/metastatic lesions. In multiple primary malignancies, with increase in the number of primary tumors, the frequency rapidly decreases. Here, we report an exceptionally rare case of a woman who was diagnosed with metachronous sporadic sextuple primary malignancies including bilateral breast cancers (gastric cancer, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, left breast cancer, thyroid cancer, right breast cancer, and rectal neuroendocrine tumor). The sextuple primary malignancies in this case involved 5 different organs: the stomach, ovary, thyroid, rectum, and bilateral breasts. Further studies are needed to elucidate the current epidemiologic status of patients with multiple primary malignancies. Acinar metaplasia is an initial step in a series of events that can lead to pancreatic cancer. Here we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of mouse pancreas during the progression from preinvasive stages to tumor formation. Using a reporter gene, we identify metaplastic cells that originated from acinar cells and express two transcription factors, Onecut2 and Foxq1. Further analyses of metaplastic acinar cell heterogeneity define six acinar metaplastic cell types and states, including stomach-specific cell types. Localization of metaplastic cell types and mixture of different metaplastic cell types in the same pre-malignant lesion is shown. Finally, single-cell transcriptome analyses of tumor-associated stromal, immune, endothelial and fibroblast cells identify signals that may support tumor development, as well as the recruitment and education of immune cells. Our findings are consistent with the early, premalignant formation of an immunosuppressive environment mediated by interactions between acinar metaplastic cells and other cells in the microenvironment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have pivotal roles in the initiation and progression of gastric cancer (GC), and miR-92a-3p has been proved to act as an oncogene in multiple malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms by which miR-92a-3p contributes to GC remain unclear. The differentially expressed miRNAs were screened by GEO dataset, and the association of miR-92a-3p expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in patients with GC was analyzed by TCGA dataset. The target genes of miR-92a-3p were identified by bioinformatic analysis, and their interaction was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. MTT, EdU and Transwell assays were conducted to determine the role of miR-92a-3p in GC cells. As a result, it was found that the expression levels of miR-92a-3p were increased in GC tissues and were associated with tumor size, lymph node infiltration and distant metastasis, acting as an independent prognostic factor of poor survival in patients with GC. Restored expression of miR-92a-3p facilitated cell proliferation, DNA synthesis and cell invasion, but its inhibitor reversed these effects. KLF2 was further identified as a direct target of miR-92a-3p, indicating a negative correlation with miR-92a-3p expression and harboring a favorable prognosis in GC. In addition, KLF2 repressed cell proliferation and invasion and attenuated the tumor-promoting effects of miR-92a-3p in GC cells. Altogether, our findings demonstrated that miR-92a-3p promoted the proliferation and invasion of GC cells by targeting KLF2. In recent years, natural products have increasingly attracted more attention because of their potential anticancer activity and low intrinsic toxicity. Hispidulin is a natural flavonoid with a wide range of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiplatelet, anticonvulsant, anti-osteoporotic, and notably anticancer activities. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that hispidulin, as a potential anticancer drug, affects cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Moreover, hispidulin exhibits synergistic anti-tumor effects when combined with some common clinical anticancer drugs (e.g., gemcitabine, 5-fluoroucil, sunitinib, temozolomide, and TRAIL). The combination of hispidulin and chemotherapeutic drugs reduces the efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs, enhances the chemosensitivity of cancer cells, and reverses drug resistance. Herein, we outlined the anticancer effects of hispidulin in various cancers and its intracellular molecular targets and related mechanisms of its anticancer activity. Based on the available literature, it can be established that hispidulin has significant potential to become an important complementary medicine for cancer prevention and treatment. However, more in-depth in vitro and in vivo studies should be conducted to support its translation from bench to bedside. There is a complex ecosystem of bacteria and other microorganisms inside and outside the human body, which play an intricate role in maintaining health. In recent years, many researches focused on the relationship between microorganisms and cancer. Studies have identified that numerous microbes are presented in human stomach, which are closely linked to the development of gastric cancer (GC).  Proximal gastrectomy is an alternative treatment modality for gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach. Though several reconstruction methods have been introduced, there is no standardization. We investigated the outcomes of laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double tract reconstruction (LPG-DTR).\\nTo investigate the outcomes of LPG-DTR.\\nWe evaluated 37 patients who underwent curative LPG with DTR between December 2013 and December 2018. Less than half of the proximal stomach was laparoscopically resected. We performed LPG-DTR after resection.\\nA total of 37 patients were included in this study, 25 (70%) of whom were male and 12 (30%) of whom were female. Overall, 31 (83.7%) patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer, 5 (13.5%) with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and 1 (2.8%) with leiomyoma. There were 3 (9.6%) complications. However, there were no complications of grade 3 or above. We did not observe postoperative mortality or recurrence after surgery. All patients underwent postoperative endoscopic surveillance successfully. None of the patients had postoperative reflux esophagitis or stenosis. The body weight and hemoglobin levels of the patients were lowest 12 months after surgery and gradually increased thereafter. Similarly, their vitamin B\\nLPG-DTR is a favorable treatment modality for gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach. To investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic factors related to early gastric cancer recurrence after curative resection.\\nBetween October 2006 and August 2018, a total of 149 patients with recurrence of gastric cancer/adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction after curative resection were enrolled from our treatment group. A retrospective clinical analysis was performed on these patients with gastric cancer recurrence after curative resection.\\nAmong the 149 patients, 99 (66.4%) had only one recurrence pattern, and 50 (33.6%) had multiple recurrence patterns. The median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 18.2 months (95% CI 15.0-21.4). Ninety-four patients (63.1%) experienced early recurrence (recurrence within 24 months after curative resection), and 55 patients (36.9%) experienced late recurrence (recurrence beyond 24 months after curative resection). The univariate analysis showed that perineural invasion (P=0.002), depth of invasion (P=0.026), postoperative chemotherapy (P=0.036) and postoperative complications (P=0.004) were significant factors associated with early recurrence after curative resection for gastric cancer. Perineural invasion (P=0.003), postoperative chemotherapy (P=0.036) and postoperative complications (P=0.042) were independent factors associated with early recurrence after curative resection in the multivariate analysis. The survival analysis showed that perineural invasion (P=0.011) and postoperative complications (P=0.007) were independent prognostic factors. The median survival time of early recurrence patients was significantly shorter than that of late recurrence patients (25.4 vs 62.9 months, P<0.001).\\nPerineural invasion, postoperative chemotherapy and postoperative complications were independent factors associated with early recurrence after curative resection. Patients with early recurrence after curative resection had poorer survival. To investigate the clinical significance of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 19 (USP19) expression in gastric cancer (GC) compared with that in normal tissues and gastric cell lines.\\nUSP19 protein expression was analyzed in 212 paired GC samples using immunohistochemical staining. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the level of USP19 in gastric cell lines. The biological functions of USP19 were investigated by MTT assay, colony-forming assay, wound healing assay and gelatin zymography, and apoptotic cells were detected by immunohistochemistry assays in SGC7901 xenograft models.\\nUSP19 expression was significantly increased in GC cells and tissues, and the high level of USP19 expression was positively correlated with the Lauren\\'s classification and poor prognosis. Moreover, USP19 was identified as a novel independent prognostic biomarker in GC patients. Enhanced USP19 expression promoted GC cell proliferation and metastasis through reduced cleaved caspase-3 and increased MMP2/MMP9 expression and promoted enzyme activity in the study, and verified the results through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and bioinformatic websites from the Kaplan-Meier plotter (http://kmplot.com) and GEPIA (http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn.).\\nOur study suggests that USP19 promoted tumor progression by inducing MMP2/MMP9 expression and related enzyme activity. Hence, USP19 may be a valuable prognostic predictor for GC, and the USP19-MMP2/MMP9 axis could serve as a therapeutic target. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) extremely and rarely metastasize to the skin, and such metastases have not been well characterized.\\nRetrospective analysis of clinicopathological data of patients with skin metastasis of a GIST (SM-GIST) admitted to Xiangya Hospital (Changsha, Hunan, China) and literature review were conducted.\\nIncluding our 4 cases, a total of 17 cases have been reported to date. The mean age of the patients was 55.4 years (29~70 years) and there was not sex predominance (male 10 and female 7). Primary tumors were often located in the stomach (n=9), duodenum (n=2) and small bowel (n=2). Meanwhile, SM-GIST mainly occurred in head and face (n=6), extremities (n=6), followed by abdomen wall (n=5), back (n=3) and chest (n=2). Mutation analysis revealed that the frequency of wild-type GIST (WT-GIST), exon 9, 11 and 13 mutations was 6, 1, 4 and 1, respectively. The average time to SM-GIST was 4.22 years, specifically 4.59 years in gastric and 3.8 years in non-gastric. Moreover, for the resection only group (including chemotherapy), such average time was 3.63 years, while for the combined group (resection and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)), it was about 4.74 years. The mean survival was approximately 6.2 years. However, after the diagnosis of SM-GIST, survival was only about 1.69 years.\\nSM-GIST is a rare malignant condition. Non-gastric GIST, surgery without TKIs, high invasiveness and tumor burden, and molecular subtype (mutation in exon 9, 11 and wild-type) may be conducive to the development of SM-GIST. Additionally, it is also a sign of poor prognosis. Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) for gastric cancer has been progressed and popular in Japan, since it was first described in 1994. Several reconstruction methods can be adopted according to remnant stomach size, and balance of pros and cons. Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction is a one of standard options after LDG. Its complications include Petersen\\'s hernia and Roux stasis syndrome. Here we report our ingenious attempt, fixation of Roux limb and duodenal stump, for decreasing the development of Petersen\\'s hernia and Roux stasis syndrome.\\nTo develop a method to decrease the development of Petersen\\'s hernia and Roux stasis syndrome.\\nWe performed ante-colic R-Y reconstruction after LDG. After R-Y reconstruction, we fixed Roux limb onto the duodenal stump in a smooth radian. \\nThe operative time was (308.0 ± 84.6 min). This improvement method took about 10 min. Two (6.5%) patients experienced pneumonia and pancreatitis, respectively. No patient required reoperation or readmission. All patients were followed up for at least 3 year, and none of the patients developed postoperative complications related to internal hernia or Roux stasis syndrome.\\nThis 10 min technique is a very effective method to decrease the development of Petersen\\'s hernia and Roux stasis syndrome in patients who undergo LDG. Sister Mary Joseph (SMJ) nodule is a metastatic umbilical nodule seen in primary tumors of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. The stomach and colon are the common gastrointestinal cancers associated with SMJ nodule. The pancreas is a rare primary site for umbilical metastasis. Moreover, malignant umbilical nodules as the first presentation in pancreatic cancer is rare. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma that metastasizes to umbilicus usually arise from the body or tail of the pancreas. The presence of SMJ nodule usually indicates poor prognosis. Umbilical nodule is a simple physical finding to the presence of an advanced intra-abdominal malignancy. Although rare, pancreatic cancer should be considered as one of the primary sites in such a situation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a relationship between bleeding response and radiotherapy dose to palliate patients with local recurrence or progression of gastric cancer (GC). To this end, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that evaluated the bleeding response in patients with GC with local recurrence or progression. A meta-regression analysis between biological effective dose (BED) and bleeding response was performed, as was subgroup analysis to evaluate the outcome by BED level and radiotherapy (RT) technique. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Ten non-comparative retrospective studies and one prospective study were included. In general, RT was effective at controlling tumor bleeding, and the bleeding response rate was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.81). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated a linear correlation between BED Gy 10 and bleeding response (p=0<0001). Studies using conformational RT had a significant bleeding response rate compared to those using 2D (0.79; 95%CI, 0.74-0.84 vs 0.65; 95%CI, 0.56-0.75; p=0.021). In terms of the BED level, a significant difference in BR was identified on comparing BED Gy10 ≥40 (0.79; 95%CI, 0.7-0.8), BED Gy10 30-39 (0.79, 95%CI, 0.71-0.86), and BED Gy10 <30 (0.64; 95%CI, 0.5-0.7; p=0.0001). The mean survival time was 3.31 months (95%CI, 2.73-3.9) months, and the responders had a significantly longer survival (longer by 2.5 months) compared to the non-responders (95%CI, 1.7-3.3; p<0.0001). Palliative RT is effective at controlling bleeding due to local recurrence/progression from GC. Our findings reveal a relationship between BR and BED. BED <30 Gy 10 should not be recommended, and 3DRT should be indicated instead in order to improve the result. Gastrointestinal cancers are considered as the most common type of cancer among men and the second most common cancer in women after breast cancer in Iran. This study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi Province.\\nThis is an epidemiological study in which data was gathered from the population-based cancer registry program in the Markazi province of Iran during the years 2010-2014. Data were recorded in Excel software and coded based on ICD-O. All cases out of Markazi provinces were excluded from study, and cases with code C-15-C20 were included in this study. Stata 11 was used to analyze the data.\\nIn this study, 2975 new cases of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province were included in the analysis. The highest number of cancers was stomach (with 1595 cases), followed by colorectal cancer (980 cases), esophageal cancer (318 cases), and finally small bowl cancer (82 cases). The mean age of gastro-intestinal cancer diagnosis was 65.07 years. The results showed that with increasing age, the incidence of gastro-intestinal cancers increased, and in all sites and both sexes, the highest incidence of gastro-intestinal cancer was in the age group above 70 years. In both sexes, the age specific rate of stomach cancer was higher than other sites (with highest incidence in 2013) followed by colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and small bowl cancer.\\nThe results showed similar incidence rate of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province to other provinces in Iran. This study found that stomach cancer is the most common cancer in the Markazi province; therefore, identifying effective and preventing factors is necessary. The choice of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) as first line treatment for selected early gastric cancer (EGC) patients was proved as effective as surgical treatment in studies over many countries. Yet there is no such cohort comparison in Taiwan. This study is aimed to describe our experience in ESD treated EGC and to compare the outcomes with those underwent surgical treatment.\\nThis was a retrospective cohort study reviewing the patients with EGC underwent ESD and surgical treatments in a single tertiary referral center in Taiwan. The primary endpoint was disease specific survival. Recurrence free survival and length of hospital stay were also compared.\\nThe disease specific survival between indicated ESD and surgery showed no significant difference (cumulative survival 100% vs. 97.03%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.39), so as the recurrence free survival (cumulative survival 92.31% vs. 94.06%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.60). In subgroup analyses of ESD treated patients, a non-significant recurrence rate difference between indicated and non-indicated ESD was found (cumulative recurrence 7.69% vs. 20%, p\\xa0=\\xa00.39) and a higher recurrence rate in patients with non-R0 resection compared with R0 resection (cumulative recurrence 0% vs. 40%, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01). However, the shorter duration of hospital stay in ESD group was noted in comparison to surgery (mean 5.67 days vs. 15.75 days, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01). The ESD patients have minor complications including bleeding, perforation and fever than surgery.\\nESD is a reasonable first line treatment in selected early gastric cancer in additional to surgery. Pre-treatment evaluation and post-ESD review of curability is crucial to further surveillance program or definite therapy including surgery. Primary gastric squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is rarely encountered clinically. SCC, which presents as a submucosal tumor, is even rarer. Without the support of pathological evidence, it is difficult to make a correct preoperative diagnosis. Due to limited clinical data, the pathogenesis and treatment of gastric SCC remain unclear.\\nA 69-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with unexplained weight loss. Endoscopy revealed a submucosal mass without any ulcer on its surface located on the body of the stomach. The results of 2 gastroscopic mucosal biopsies were chronic inflammation.\\nThe clinical diagnosis by computed tomography (CT) and gastroscopy was gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) preoperatively. The postoperative pathological examination demonstrated this tumor as moderately differentiated SCC.\\nTotal gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and splenectomy were performed.\\nThe patient was discharged 7 days after the surgery without any complications. The follow-up CT scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease 6 months after surgery.\\nLarge primary gastric SCC could present as a submucosal mass. Gastroscopic mucosal biopsy may not be able to get tumor tissue due to inflammatory reaction. Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory disorder characterized by specific pathologic findings and often, but not in all cases, elevated serum IgG4 concentration. Although it can virtually involve every organ system, cases involving the gastrointestinal tract and especially gastric mass lesions have rarely been reported.\\nA 45-year-old man, who was incidentally discovered asymptomatic subepithelial tumor (SET), by endoscopy, on the greater curvature of the upper gastric body, was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\\nThe patient was postoperatively diagnosed with IgG4-RD by histopathologic results.\\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic wedge resection.\\nThe patient is presently followed up annually in our clinic and had no problems and showed no signs of recurrence in examination.\\nWe reported a rare case of IgG4-RD presenting as a gastric SET. The first line treatment of IgG4-RD is glucocorticoid administration. However, because pathologic examination is challenging owing to the lesion location, preoperative diagnosis is difficult and may lead to unnecessary gastric resection. Thus, using alternative preoperative diagnostic methods such as endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy or the biopsy unroofing technique could spare the patient from unnecessary surgical treatment. For the diagnosis of gastric adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC), discrepancies regarding a rational diagnostic proportion of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) component exist among different organizations. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of the SCC component on the survival of gastric cancer patients and identify the optimal cutoff value for the SCC component necessary for diagnosing gastric ASC.Cases of gastric cancer with an SCC component were obtained from our center and from case reports and series extracted from Medline. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to compare the overall survival between groups and examine the prognostic value of various clinical parameters.We identified 45 qualified cases in published literature and 13 in our center. Forty-two of them were males and 16 females (M: F\\u200a=\\u200a2.6:1). Thirty of them were Asian patients and the rest were mainly from the United States and Europe. The mean age was 61.1 years (median 64 years, range 32-84 years). The average tumor size was 6.9\\u200acm (median 6.0\\u200acm, range 2.0-16.0\\u200acm). The most common location of the cancer was the lower third (39.7%). Although a statistical difference was not achieved, the Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated that as the proportion of the SCC component in the primary lesion increased, the patients\\' survival risk increased (P\\u200a=\\u200a.489), and the presence of the SCC component in metastatic lymph nodes also increased the risk of survival (P\\u200a=\\u200a.259); both of these findings indicated a negative impact of the SCC component on survival. Furthermore, we identified the optimal cutoff for the SCC component as 35% (χ\\u200a=\\u200a6.544, P\\u200a=\\u200a.011), which was subsequently validated in a Cox regression model as an independent prognostic factor (P\\u200a=\\u200a.026).An increased proportion of the SCC component is associated with worse survival in gastric cancer patients with an SCC component. The optimal cutoff for the proportion of the SCC component necessary for the diagnosis of gastric ASC is 35%. To investigate the expression and clinical significance of aquaporin-1 (AQP1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) in gastric cancer.A total of 79 gastric cancer patients who were admitted into Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital from January, 2018 to December, 2019 were involved in this study. Tumor specimens and para-cancerous normal tissues (> 2\\u200acm away from the tumor) of all the enrolled patients were collected. Immunohistochemistry were performed to identify the expression of AQP1, VEGF, and MVD and the correlation between AQP1, VEGF, MVD, and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed.The expression of AQP1, VEGF and MVD in gastric cancer tissue was increased significantly compared with those in para-cancerous tissue (P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). AQP1, VEGF, and MVD were closely correlated with gastric cancer differentiation, lymph node metastasis, vascular tumor thrombosis and clinical stage (P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). Spearman correlation analysis showed that AQP1 was positively associated with VEGF expression (r = 0.497, P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). MVD was enhanced in VEGF or AQP1 positive cancer tissues compared with that in VEGF or AQP1 negative tissue (P\\u200a<\\u200a.05).Synergistic effect among AQP1, VEGF, and MVD is involved in occurrence and development of gastric cancer. There are no definite guidelines for the management of gastric lesions diagnosed as indefinite for dysplasia (IND) by endoscopic forceps biopsy (EFB). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of gastric IND and predictive factors for gastric neoplasm.\\nThis study included 457 patients with a first diagnosis of gastric IND by EFB between January 2005 and December 2013. Patient characteristics and endoscopic and pathological data were reviewed and compared.\\nOf the 457 gastric IND patients, 128 (28%) were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma, 21 (4.6%) with high-grade dysplasia, 31 (6.8%) with low-grade dysplasia, and 277 (60.6%) as negative for dysplasia. Of lesions observed, 180 (39.4%) showed upgraded histology. Multivariate analysis revealed that surface erythema (odds ratio [OR], 2.804; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.741 to 4.516), spontaneous bleeding (OR, 2.618; 95% CI, 1.298 to 5.279), lesion size ≥ 1 cm (OR, 5.762; 95% CI, 3.459 to 9.597), and depressed morphology (OR, 2.183; 95% CI, 1.155 to 4.124) were significant risk factors for high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. The ORs associated with 2 and ≥ 3 risk factors were 7.131 and 34.86, respectively.\\nPrecautions should be taken in the management of gastric IND patients, especially when risk factors, including surface erythema, spontaneous bleeding, lesion size ≥ 1 cm, and depressed morphology are present. Considering the combined effect of the presence of multiple risk factors on the incidence of high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma, endoscopic resection should be recommended if a gastric IND patient has at two or more of these factors. Regional variations in gastric cancer incidence are not explained by prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, the main cause of the disease, with several areas presenting high H. pylori prevalence but low gastric cancer incidence. The IARC worldwide H. pylori prevalence surveys (ENIGMA) aim at systematically describing age and sex-specific prevalence of H. pylori infection around the world and generating hypotheses to explain regional variations in gastric cancer risk.\\nWe selected age- and sex-stratified population samples in two areas with different gastric cancer incidence and mortality in Chile: Antofagasta (lower rate) and Valdivia (higher rate). Participants were 1-69 years old and provided interviews and blood for anti-H. pylori antibodies (IgG, VacA, CagA, others) and atrophy biomarkers (pepsinogens).\\nH. pylori seroprevalence (Age-standardized to world population) and antibodies against CagA and VacA were similar in both sites. H. pylori seroprevalence was 20% among children <10 years old, 40% among 10-19 year olds, 60% in the 20-29 year olds and close to or above 80% in those 30+ years. The comparison of the prevalence of known and potential H. pylori cofactors in gastric carcinogenesis between the high and the low risk area showed that consumption of chili products was significantly higher in Valdivia and daily non-green vegetable consumption was more common in Antofagasta. Pepsinogen levels suggestive of gastric atrophy were significantly more common and occurred at earlier ages in Valdivia, the higher risk area. In a multivariate model combining both study sites, age, chili consumption and CagA were the main risk factors for gastric atrophy.\\nThe prevalence of H. pylori infection and its virulence factors was similar in the high and the low risk area, but atrophy was more common and occurred at younger ages in the higher risk area. Dietary factors could partly explain higher rates of atrophy and gastric cancer in Valdivia.\\nThe ENIGMA study in Chile contributes to better understanding regional variations in gastric cancer incidence and provides essential information for public health interventions. Helicobacter pylori is a fastidious Gram-negative bacterium that infects over half of the world\\'s population, causing chronic gastritis and is a risk factor for stomach cancer. In developing and rural regions where prevalence rate exceeds 60%, persistence and waterborne transmission are often linked to poor sanitation conditions. Here we demonstrate that H. pylori not only survives but also replicates within acidified free-living amoebal phagosomes. Bacterial counts of the clinical isolate H. pylori G27 increased over 50-fold after three days in co-culture with amoebae. In contrast, a H. pylori mutant deficient in a cagPAI gene (cagE) showed little growth within amoebae, demonstrating the likely importance of a type IV secretion system in H. pylori for amoebal infection. We also demonstrate that H. pylori can be packaged by amoebae and released in extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, and for the first time, we successfully demonstrate the ability of two free-living amoebae to revert and recover viable but non-cultivable coccoid (VBNC)-H. pylori to a culturable state. Our studies provide evidence to support the hypothesis that amoebae and perhaps other free-living protozoa contribute to the replication and persistence of human-pathogenic H. pylori by providing a protected intracellular microenvironment for this pathogen to persist in natural aquatic environments and engineered water systems, thereby H. pylori potentially uses amoeba as a carrier and a vector of transmission. To investigate the expression of BUB1 gene in gastric cancer.\\nOncomine, GEPIA, BioGPS and Kaplan-Meier Plotter databases were used to analyze the difference of BUB1 gene expression between gastric cancer tissue and normal gastric tissue. The association of BUB1 expression level with the prognosis of gastric cancer patients was also analyzed. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) was explored to analyze the expression of BUB1 in T cells and B cells in gastric cancer patients, and the String database was used to generate the network map of BUB1-related proteins and functional annotation of gene ontology (GO). The related pathways of KEGG were analyzed. Tumor immune assessment resource (TIMER) database was used to analyze the expression of BUB1 in immune infiltration and its effect on prognosis of gastric cancer patients. To further verify the results of gene chip analysis in Oncomine database, we collected 30 pairs of surgical specimens of gastric adenocarcinoma and adjacent tissues from patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College from March, 2018 to July, 2019. The results of BUB1 gene expression in Oncomine database were verified by PCR and immunohistochemistry.\\nOncomine, GEPIA and BioGPS analyses showed that BUB1 was highly expressed in gastric cancer compared with normal gastric tissue. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the progression-free survival time (HR=0.52, 95% \\nBUB1 gene is highly expressed in gastric cancer. BUB1 may reduce tumor immunosuppression and helps to evaluate the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Studies of sleep duration in relation to the risk of site-specific cancers other than breast cancer are scarce. Furthermore, the available results are inconclusive and the causality remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the potential causal associations of sleep duration with overall and site-specific cancers using the Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the sleep traits identified from a genome-wide association study were used as instrumental variables to estimate the association with overall cancer and 22 site-specific cancers among 367\\u2009586 UK Biobank participants. A replication analysis was performed using data from the FinnGen consortium (up to 121\\u2009579 individuals). There was suggestive evidence that genetic liability to short-sleep duration was associated with higher odds of cancers of the stomach (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.30; P = .018), pancreas (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.32-3.62; P = .002) and colorectum (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.95; P = .006), but with lower odds of multiple myeloma (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22-0.99; P = .047). Suggestive evidence of association of genetic liability to long-sleep duration with lower odds of pancreatic cancer (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.79; P = .005) and kidney cancer (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.90; P = .025) was observed. However, none of these associations passed the multiple comparison threshold and two-sample MR analysis using FinnGen data did not confirm these findings. In conclusion, this MR study does not provide strong evidence to support causal associations of sleep duration with risk of overall and site-specific cancers. Further MR studies are required. Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) requires the administration of intravenous (IV) fluorescein. This study aimed to determine the optimal dose of IV fluorescein for both upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract pCLE.\\nPatients 20 to 79 years old with gastric high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or colorectal neoplasms (CRNs) were enrolled in the study. The dose de-escalation method was employed with five levels. The primary endpoint of the study was the determination of the optimal dose of IV fluorescein for pCLE of the GI tract. The reduced dose was determined based on off-line reviews by three endoscopists. An insufficient dose of fluorescein was defined as the dose of fluorescein with which the pCLE images were not deemed to be visible. If all three endoscopists determined that the tissue structure was visible, the doses were de-escalated.\\nA total of 12 patients with gastric HGD and 12 patients with CRNs were enrolled in the study. Doses were de-escalated to 0.5 mg/kg of fluorescein for both non-neoplastic duodenal and colorectal mucosa. All gastric HGD or CRNs were visible with pCLE with IV fluorescein at 0.5 mg/kg.\\nIn the present study, pCLE with IV fluorescein 0.5 mg/kg was adequate to visualize the magnified structure of both the upper and lower GI tract. Gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Immunotherapy via programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade has shown benefits for gastric cancer. Epigenetic DNA methylation critically regulates cancer immune checkpoints. We investigated how the natural compound oleanolic acid (OA) affected PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) at 20\\u2009ng/mL was used to stimulate human gastric cancer MKN-45 cells. IL-1β significantly increased PD-L1 expression, which was abolished by OA. Next, OA-treated MKN-45 cells were co-cultured with activated and PD-1-overexpressing Jurkat T cells. OA restored IL-2 levels in the co-culture system and increased T cell killing toward MKN-45 cells. Overexpression of PD-L1 eliminated OA-enhanced T cell killing capacity; however, PD-1 blocking antibody abrogated the cytotoxicity of T cells. Moreover, OA abolished IL-1β-increased DNA demethylase activity in MKN-45 cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine rescued OA-reduced PD-L1 expression; whereas DNA demethylation inhibitor gemcitabine inhibited PD-L1 expression, and, in combination with OA, provided more potent inhibitory effects. Furthermore, OA selectively reduced the expression of DNA demethylase TET3 in IL-1β-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of TET3 restored OA-reduced PD-L1 expression. Finally, OA disrupted nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling IL-1β-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of NF-κB restored OA downregulation of TET3 and PD-L1. The cytotoxicity of T cells toward MKN-45 cells was also weakened by NF-κB overexpression. Altogether, OA blocked the IL-1β/NF-κB/TET3 axis in gastric cancer cells, leading to DNA hypomethylation and downregulation of PD-L1. Our discoveries suggested OA as an epigenetic modulator for immunotherapy or an adjuvant therapy against gastric cancer. Gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas are heterogeneous, comprising four molecularly distinct subtypes, namely EBV-positive, microsatellite instability (MSI), chromosomal instability (CIN) and genomically stable (GS) subtypes, and a part of this heterogeneity may hypothesized to be different cells-of-origin. Stem/progenitor cell hierarchy in the stomach is complex, which include the Lgr5\\nWhile previous studies have focused on non-nuclear Lgr5 expression, nuclear Lgr5 expression has been reported in a subset of stem cells, and we examined nuclear Lgr5 expression in a local cohort of 95 cases of gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma. mRNA levels for LGR5 and other stem cell marker genes were examined in the TCGA cohort.\\nWe observed nuclear Lgr5 expression in a 18/95 cases. Near mutual exclusivity was seen between nuclear Lgr5 and strong non-nuclear Lgr5. Both strong non-nuclear and nuclear Lgr5 expression tended to be seen more frequently with the intestinal histotype and approximated CIN molecular subtype. With respect to overall survival (OS), nuclear Lgr5 expression appears to be protective, with the worst survival being seen in the cases lacking nuclear Lgr5 and with low non-nuclear Lgr5 expression. When compared to other stem/progenitor cell markers, LGR5 mRNA expression clusters with other GSC marker genes, including VIL1. Higher expression of these GSC marker genes was associated with better OS.\\nOur results show that Lgr5 expression is dynamic in gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma and heterogeneous across the several disease attributes. We postulate that this may reflect \"retained stemness\" in the form of Lgr5 ABSTRACT\\xa0 Objective: To describe the clinical, pathological and survival characteristics of Turkish patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs).\\nDescriptive study.\\nBezmialem Vakif University School of Medicine Hospital from April 2012 to September 2018.\\nSixty-one patients with GEP-NENs were analysed in retrospect for the clinical, pathological and survival characteristics. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis and the Log-rank test was performed to analyse the comparisons between the groups.\\n\\xa0Forty-five of the 61 GEP-NENs patients (73.8%) were neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and 26.2% of patients were neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). The mean age of patients was 55.5 ± 11.3 years. The most frequent localisation of tumors was stomach (34.4%), and the most common symptom was abdominal pain (27.9%). The rate of distant metastases was 31.1% at diagnosis and 63.9% of the patients were operated. The median follow-up period was 27 months. The rate of three-years overall survival (OS) was 88.5% and the five-years OS rate was 86.9%. The variables that can significantly influence the OS rate were high grade (grade 3; p= 0.005), Ki-67 proliferation index (Ki-67 >20%; p= 0.002) and distant metastases (p= 0.018).\\nGEP-NENs may develop anywhere in the digestive tract. Approximately one-third of the patients may be metastatic due to delay in diagnosis. Key Words: Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, Neuroendocrine cancers, Neuroendocrine neoplasms. Gastric cancer is a disease with high mortality, which threatens the health of people for a long time. At present, the main treatment methods are surgery and chemotherapy, but these methods have great harm to the human body. However, it is found that the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine have an obvious therapeutic effect in the adjuvant treatment of the tumor. Therefore, the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine have become a research hotspot in the anti-tumor field. In recent years, many related researchers have been particularly active in studying the in vitro activity and mechanism of active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine on human gastric cancer cells. In this paper, the Chinese herbal medicine extracts, polysaccharides, alkaloids, saponins, flavones, terpenes, quinones, volatile oils, esters, phenols, protein components and other active ingredients of Chinese medicine were used as the starting points to investigate the anti-gastric cancer mechanism, such as inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells, inhibiting cell invasion and migration; inhibiting over-expression of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF); interfering with cell mitosis; and regulating cell signaling pathways. Their in vitro inhibitory activity and mechanism for gastric cancer cells were described in this study, providing a theoretical reference for the development and application of anti-gastric cancer drugs. Fatigue prevalence and severity have been assessed in a variety of studies, yet, not in a standardized way, and predominantly in breast cancer patients. Systematic, comparative investigations across a broad range of cancer entities are lacking.\\nThe FiX study systematically enrolled 2244 cancer patients across 15 entities approximately 2\\xa0years after diagnosis. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional EORTC QLQ-FA12 questionnaire. Physical, emotional, cognitive, and total fatigue were compared across entities and with normative values of the general population. Differences in patients\\' characteristics and cancer therapy between entities were taken into account using analyses of covariance models.\\nAcross all entities, mean physical fatigue levels were significantly higher than age- and sex-matched means of the general population for all cancer entities (all Bonferroni-Holm adjusted P\\xa0<\\xa0.01). For most entities also emotional and cognitive fatigue levels were significantly higher than normative values. Age- and sex-standardized physical fatigue prevalence ranged from 31.8% among prostate to 51.7% among liver cancer patients. Differences between entities could not be fully explained by sex, age, BMI, or cancer therapy. Adjusted for these factors, mean physical fatigue was higher for stomach (P\\xa0=\\xa0.0004), lung (P\\xa0=\\xa0.034), kidney (P\\xa0=\\xa0.0011), pancreas (P\\xa0=\\xa0.081), and endometrium (P\\xa0=\\xa0.022) compared to breast cancer patients. Adjusted means of emotional fatigue were also lowest in breast cancer patients and significantly higher in stomach (P\\xa0=\\xa0.0047), bladder (P\\xa0=\\xa0.0036), and rectal (P\\xa0=\\xa0.0020) cancer patients.\\nPhysical, emotional, and cognitive fatigue is prevalent in all 15 investigated cancer entities even 2\\xa0years after diagnosis. Fatigue in breast cancer patients, the so-far most studied group, is in the lowest range among all entities, suggesting that the extent of fatigue is still insufficiently determined. Entity-specific problems might need to be considered in the treatment of fatigue. 胃淋巴瘤是我国最常见的胃恶性肿瘤之一，近年来发病率明显上升。胃淋巴瘤的发生与幽门螺杆菌（ 乳腺梭形细胞癌是化生性癌的一种组织学亚型，发病率低，恶性度高，远处转移以肺转移最常见。乳腺梭形细胞癌发生胃转移罕见，该文报道1例72岁女性乳腺梭形细胞癌胃转移的病例，总结其临床病理学特征、组织形态和免疫表型、诊断与鉴别诊断，以提高对本病的认识。. 印戒细胞样形态是神经内分泌肿瘤的一种罕见亚型，该文报道1例63岁男性的胃印戒细胞样神经内分泌肿瘤，显微镜下肿瘤细胞形态一致，细胞核偏心性位于细胞一侧，胞质空亮，极易误诊为印戒细胞癌细胞。该文描述其组织学特点、免疫表型、电镜特点，提出诊断和鉴别诊断要点，并复习和总结相关文献。.  在我国，消化内镜医师大都采用了日本制定的内镜术语和标准进行消化道早期癌的诊断和治疗。但我国病理医师多数接受了以西方观点为核心的WHO肿瘤诊断标准，常常导致按照日本病理标准诊断为早期胃癌，我国病理医师常诊断为高级别上皮内瘤变或异型增生，造成内镜医师和病理诊断不一致，给临床诊疗工作造成困惑。为此，该文介绍了WHO消化系统肿瘤分类第5版中关于胃癌，特别是早期胃癌及其前驱病变的定义和诊断标准的变化，比较了西方传统观点和日本对早期胃癌的不同概念和病理诊断标准，分析了按照西方和日本标准造成病理诊断不一致的根本原因，期望WHO消化系统肿瘤分类第5版能够推动我国早期胃癌的临床诊疗和病理诊断工作得到进一步发展。. A quality of life assessment is useful in identifying a specific health impact on patients who are suffering from various medical conditions. This study estimated the quality of life among patients with cancers of the lungs, breast, colorectum, oesophagus, liver, and stomach in urban China and evaluates the associated factors.\\nThis study employed a random cluster sampling strategy to recruit patients with lung, breast, colorectal, oesophageal, liver, or stomach cancer from eleven third-grade class-A (the highest level) hospitals in Beijing between October 2013 and May 2014. We performed a quality of life survey that included solicitation of sociodemographic and clinical information and the use of a EuroQoL five-dimension three-level questionnaire. We applied the Chinese time trade-off method to calculate the health utility values, which were transformed into binary variables (using the median as the cut-off). In addition, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with the quality of life.\\nA total of 637 patients (91 with lung cancer, 152 with breast cancer, 60 with colorectal cancer, 108 with oesophageal cancer, 154 with liver cancer, and 72 with stomach cancer) were included in this study; the medians of the health utility values were 0.780, 0.800, 0.800, 0.860, 0.800, and 0.870, respectively. The most common concerns for patients of all six cancer types were pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The reported health status of patients was associated with various demographic and clinical variables.\\nThis study highlighted that pain relief and psychological support are important aspects of patient management for those with these types of cancer. Individuals with factors associated with a poorer quality of life should be targets for additional support. The role of controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score in predicting cancer survival remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the CONUT score and to develop a more appropriate scoring system beyond CONUT for gastric cancer.\\nWe retrospectively reviewed 1307 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy between 2009 and 2015. The CONUT and three modified scores with modified lipid components (L-CONUT: albumin/total lymphocyte count [TLC]/low density lipoprotein, H-CONUT: albumin/TLC/high density lipoprotein, and T-CONUT: albumin/TLC/triglyceride) were calculated. The predictive value of each scoring system on long-term survival was assessed.\\nThe values of the four nutritional scores were categorized into four groups (normal, light, moderate, and severe). The CONUT (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), L-CONUT (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), H-CONUT (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), and T-CONUT (P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) scores showed significant differences in overall survival in between groups. Survival analysis according to the pathological stage showed that advanced age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, male sex, and moderate H-CONUT score (HR, 3.970; 95% CI, 1.826-8.633; P\\xa0=\\xa00.001) were independent worse prognostic factors for overall survival in the stage I group. In the stage II group, light CONUT score (HR, 2.230; 95% CI, 1.067-4.664; P\\xa0=\\xa00.033) and moderate CONUT score (HR, 5.077; 95% CI, 1.647-15.650; P\\xa0=\\xa00.005) were significantly associated with poor prognosis. In the stage III group, no scoring system showed significant results.\\nIn advanced gastric cancer (beyond stage II), the prognostic impact of the nutritional scoring system was uncertain. However, the H-CONUT score is a promising indicator of prognosis in stage I, and the CONUT score is useful for predicting long-term survival in stage II gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is an extremely rare condition to occur after bariatric surgery, and most of the reported cases are adenocarcinomas. Regarding gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), there are only two reported cases occurring after bariatric surgery (one after gastric banding and the other following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)).\\nA 48-year-old woman with previous history of obesity and type 2 diabetes, treated with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 2 years earlier, was referred to our center due to complains of diffuse abdominal pain and distension associated with asthenia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic-solid mass located in the right hypochondrium, measuring 19.5 × 13.5 × 16 cm, suggesting the diagnosis of a retroperitoneal tumor. Based on these findings, a laparotomy, evidencing that the larger cystic-solid tumor was originating from the excluded stomach post-RYGB. The gastrectomy of the excluded stomach was performed aside with a conventional cholecystectomy. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed to be a gastric GIST with epithelioid cells. Currently, 12 months after surgery, the patient presents no signs of recurrence.\\nThis is the second case of gastric GIST occurring after RYGB to be reported in the literature. To provide an up-to-date review on the management of cancers of the stomach and esophagogastric junction (EGJ).\\nMicrosatellite instable (MSI) high status in gastric cancer may portend a relatively good prognosis and indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy is of no added benefit to primary surgical management. In the preoperative treatment of HER2 (ErbB2)-positive EGJ adenocarcinoma with chemoradiotherapy, the addition of trastuzumab, a recombinant humanized mAb directed against the extracellular domain of Her2, failed to improve outcome over conventional chemoradiotherapy alone. Escalating the dose of radiation in combined chemoradiotherapy regimens did not improve survival over conventional dose radiotherapy in the nonoperative management of EGJ cancer. The use of proton vs. conventional external beam radiation therapy, although potentially less toxic, did not improve therapy outcome with preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy in EGJ cancer. In metastatic HER2-positive gastric cancer, after disease progression on trastuzumab, continuation of trastuzumab did not improve progression free or overall survival compared with second-line chemotherapy alone. However, in the setting or prior trastuzumab therapy in metastatic HER2-positive gastric cancer, the new agent trastuzumab deruxtecan achieved significant rates of response, progression free and overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy. After initial chemotherapy for metastatic esophagogastric cancer, maintenance therapy with the anti PDL-1 agent avelumab was no better than chemotherapy alone.\\nMSI high gastric cancer has a better prognosis and may not require adjuvant chemotherapy. Trastuzumab, added to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in HER2-positive esophageal adenocarcinoma, does not improve outcome. Dose escalation of radiotherapy in the nonoperative management of EGJ cancer does not improve local control or survival, and proton therapy may not achieve superior outcomes compared with external beam radiotherapy. In metastatic HER2-positive gastric cancer, continuing trastuzumab into second-line chemotherapy does not add benefit; however, the novel agent trastuzumab deruxtecan has substantial activity after prior trastuzumab-based therapy. Minimally invasive therapies for obesity are a bridge between lifestyle interventions and bariatric surgery. We developed a novel device to reduce weight gain rate and evaluated its safety and efficacy in juvenile pigs.\\nThe intragastric satiety-inducing device (ISD) comprises a self-expandable esophageal metal stent connected to a star-shaped disc placed in the stomach fundus. Eight juvenile pigs were randomized into ISD (n\\u2009=\\u20095) and control (n\\u2009=\\u20093) groups. Body weight and serum ghrelin hormone were monitored weekly for 6\\xa0weeks. One pig was followed up for 4 additional weeks (rebound pig) after ISD removal. Histological examination and immunohistochemistry for the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) were performed.\\nISD placement was successful in all pigs. Two ISDs (40%) migrated at 4 and 5\\xa0weeks after placement. Weight gain rates were significantly lower in the ISD group than in the control group from week 1 to 6 but were higher in the rebound pig than in a control pig from week 7 to 10. Mean ghrelin hormone level was higher in the control group than in the ISD group from week 1 to 6. ISD induced reversible inflammatory changes in the esophagus and stomach fundus. The number of ICCs was lesser in ISD pigs than in control and rebound pigs.\\nISD placement is feasible and safe in juvenile pigs. It decreases weight gain rate but induces reversible inflammatory reaction and tissue hyperplasia. Its mechanism may be related to pressure exertion on the stomach fundus or gastric motility alteration. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is involved in human cancer development and progression. Nonetheless, the role of TGF-β1 as regards peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer has not been completely characterized. In the present study, we investigated the exact role of TGF-β1 on peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer. The results indicated that human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) exposed to TGF-β1 or serum-free conditional medium (SF-CM) of SGC7901 that produced a large amount of TGF-β1 became exfoliated, apoptosis and exhibited signs of injury, and the tumor-mesothelial cell adhesion significantly increased. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression was also increased when HPMCs were exposed to TGF-β1 or SF-CM of SGC7901. However, these effects were significantly decreased when HPMCs were exposed to SF-CM of SGC7901-TGFβS, a TGF-β1 knockdown stable cell line. Animal studies revealed that nude mice injected with SGC7901-TGFβS cells featured a smaller number of peritoneal seeding nodules and lower expression of CTGF in ascites than the control cell lines. These findings suggest that TGF-β1 promotes peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer and induces CTGF expression. Therefore, blockage of TGF-β1 or TGF-β1 signaling pathway might prevent and treat peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer. In 1955, an outbreak of arsenic poisoning caused by the ingestion of arsenic-contaminated Morinaga Dry Milk occurred in western Japan. This study aimed to assess the mortality and cancer incidence risk among Japanese individuals who were poisoned during this time as infants. In total, 6223 survivors (mean age at enrollment, 27.5\\xa0y) who had ingested contaminated milk when they were aged\\xa0≤\\xa02\\xa0y participated in this study. Follow-up was conducted from 1982 to 2018 (mean follow-up duration, 30.3\\xa0y). Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and standardized incidence ratio (SIR) were used to compare mortality and cancer incidence rates of subjects with the respective Japanese population rates, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the SMR and SIR were also calculated. In total, 561 deaths and 524 new cancer cases were observed. A statistically significant increase in mortality rate was observed for all causes (SMR, 1.15; 1.01-1.19), nervous system disease (2.83, 1.62-4.19), respiratory disease (2.02, 1.37-2.62), genitourinary system disease (2.25, 1.10-3.73), and traffic accident (2.03, 1.14-3.04). In contrast, a significant decrease in cancer incidence rate was observed for all cancers (SIR, 0.96; 0.84-0.99), stomach cancer (0.77, 0.57-0.92), colon cancer (0.63, 0.41-0.85), rectum cancer (0.69, 0.43-0.95), and breast cancer (0.72, 0.52-0.89). Liver cancer showed a high mortality rate (SMR, 1.68; 1.06-2.31). In this study, after the long-term follow-up we revealed overall and cause-specific mortality and cancer incidence risk among survivors who ingested arsenic-contaminated dry milk as infants. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia, and it occurs when the human body does not have enough of the mineral iron (https://www.healthline.com/health/iron-deficiency-anemia#diagnosis). Iron deficiency anemia is caused by blood loss, insufficient dietary intake, or poor absorption of iron from food. Sources of blood loss can include heavy periods, childbirth, uterine fibroids, stomach ulcers, colon cancer, and urinary tract bleeding (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/iron-deficiency-anemia). Poor absorption of iron from food may occur as a result of an intestinal disorder such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, or surgery such as a gastric bypass (https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/ida/en/). Little is known about the association between iron deficiency anemia and lymphocytopenia. Here, we report on a 17-year-old female who presented with iron deficiency anemia and was found to have lymphopenia. She recovered after having received intravenous iron therapy. miR-18a is a member of primary transcript called miR-17-92a (C13orf25 or MIR17HG) which also contains five other miRNAs: miR-17, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b and miR-92a. This cluster as a whole shows specific characteristics, where miR-18a seems to be unique. In contrast to the other members, the expression of miR-18a is additionally controlled and probably functions as its own internal controller of the cluster. miR-18a regulates many genes involved in proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, response to different kinds of stress, autophagy and differentiation. The disturbances of miR-18a expression are observed in cancer as well as in different diseases or pathological states. The miR-17-92a cluster is commonly described as oncogenic and it is known as \\'oncomiR-1\\', but this statement is a simplification because miR-18a can act both as an oncogene and a suppressor. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about miR-18a focusing on its regulation, role in cancer biology and utility as a potential biomarker. Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignant tumor with a high mortality rate. Drug resistance is a major obstacle to GC therapy. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of exosomal circPRRX1 in doxorubicin resistance in GC.\\nHGC-27 and AGS cells were exposed to different doses of doxorubicin to construct doxorubicin-resistant cell lines. Levels of circPRRX1, miR-3064-5p, and nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase 14 (PTPN14) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot assay. Then, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, transwell, and Western blot assays were used to explore the function of circPRRX1 in GC cells. Interactions among circPRRX1, miR-3064-5p, and PTPN14 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The in vivo function of circPRRX1 was analyzed in a xenograft tumor model.\\nCircPRRX1 was highly expressed in doxorubicin-resistant GC cell lines. Knockdown of circPRRX1 reversed doxorubicin resistance in doxorubicin-resistant GC cells. Additionally, extracellular circPRRX1 was carried by exosomes to spread doxorubicin resistance. CircPRRX1 silencing reduced doxorubicin resistance by targeting miR-3064-5p or regulating PTPN14. In GC patients, high levels of circPRRX1 in serum exosomes were associated with poor responses to doxorubicin treatment. Moreover, depletion of circPRRX1 reduced doxorubicin resistance in vivo.\\nCircPRRX1 strengthened doxorubicin resistance by modulating miR-3064-5p/PTPN14 signaling and might be a therapeutic target for GC patients. As a higher proportion of adults live beyond 85 years, their cancer burden is expected to increase. While trends among the oldest old are established for major epithelial cancers (breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers), they are less studied for minor cancers. This study describes age trends of cancer mortality, with emphasis on individuals aged 85+ years.\\nOverall cancer mortality peaked at 85 years old and decreased or stabilized for all countries except the USA, France, and Japan, in which mortality continued to increase after age 85 years. For most countries, cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, liver, and larynx have a similar flat trend patterns across all ages. Bladder and kidney cancers as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia showed a decreasing pattern after 85 years for UK, Germany, Italy and Poland. Lung cancer peaked at 80 years, although the age-specific peak among women did not follow the same pattern among all countries. Breast and prostate cancers increased after 85 years.\\nMortality stabilized or decreased after age 85, particularly for non-hormonal cancers. Whether this reflects a true biological levelling of mortality rates, or lower validity of cancer registration among the oldest old, remains open to discussion.\\nCompleted death data were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) for eight countries (2000 to 2014). Age-specific mortality rates were calculated for each 5-year age group above age 64. Joinpoint regression models were used to identify significant changes in mortality trends by age. Origanum majorana L., is an aromatic and medicinal plant distributed in different parts of Mediterranean countries. This species is widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of many diseases such as allergies, hypertension, respiratory infections, diabetes, stomach pain, and intestinal antispasmodic.\\nThis work reports previous studies on O. majorana concerning its taxonomy, botanical description, geographical distribution, traditional use, bioactive compounds, toxicology, and biological effects.\\nDifferent scientific data bases such as Web of Science, Scopus, Wiley Online, SciFinder, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink were consulted to collect data about O. majorana. The presented data emphasis bioactive compounds, traditional uses, toxicological investigations, and biological activities of O. majorana.\\nThe findings of this work marked an important correlation between the traditional use of O. majorana as an anti-allergic, antihypertensive, anti-diabetic agent, and its biological effects. Indeed, pharmacological investigations showed that essential oils and extracts from O. majorana exhibit different biological properties, particularly; antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, antiparasitic, antidiabetic, anticancer, nephrotoxicity protective, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic, hepatoprotective, and antimutagenic effects. Toxicological evaluation confirmed the safety and innocuity of this species and supported its medicinal uses. Several bioactive compounds belonging to different chemical family such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids were also identified in O. majorana.\\nThe results suggest that the pharmacological properties of O. majorana confirm its traditional uses. Indeed, O. majorana essential oils showed remarkable antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, nephroprotective, and hepatoprotective activities. However, further investigations regarding the evaluation of molecular mechanisms of identified compounds against human cancer cell lines, inflammatory process, and microbial infections are needed to validate pharmacodynamic targets. The toxicological investigation of O. Majorana confirmed its safety and therefore encouraged pharmacokinetic evaluation tests to validate its bioavailability. Trinity was the first test of a nuclear fission device. The test took place in south-central New Mexico at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range at 05:29 AM on 16 July 1945. This article provides detailed information on the methods that were used in this work to estimate the radiation doses that were received by the population that resided in New Mexico in 1945. The 721 voting precincts of New Mexico were classified according to ecozone (plains, mountains, or mixture of plains and mountains), and size of resident population (urban or rural). Methods were developed to prepare estimates of absorbed doses from a range of 63 radionuclides to five organs or tissues (thyroid, active marrow, stomach, colon, and lung) for representative individuals of each voting precinct selected according to ethnicity (Hispanic, White, Native American, and African American) and age group in 1945 (in utero, newborn, 1-2 y, 3-7 y, 8-12 y, 13-17 y, and adult). Three pathways of human exposure were included: (1) external irradiation from the radionuclides deposited on the ground; (2) inhalation of radionuclide-contaminated air during the passage of the radioactive cloud and, thereafter, of radionuclides transferred (resuspended) from soil to air; and (3) ingestion of contaminated water and foodstuffs. Within the ingestion pathway, 13 types of foods and sources of water were considered. Well established models were used for estimation of doses resulting from the three pathways using parameter values developed from extensive literature review. Because previous experience and calculations have shown that the annual dose delivered during the year following a nuclear test is much greater than the doses received in the years after that first year, the time period that was considered is limited to the first year following the day of the test (16 July 1945). Numerical estimates of absorbed doses, based on the methods described in this article, are presented in a separate article in this issue. The National Cancer Institute study of projected health risks to New Mexico residents from the 1945 Trinity nuclear test provides best estimates of organ radiation absorbed doses received by representative persons according to ethnicity, age, and county. Doses to five organs/tissues at significant risk from exposure to radioactive fallout (i.e., active bone marrow, thyroid gland, lungs, stomach, and colon) from the 63 most important radionuclides in fresh fallout from external and internal irradiation were estimated. The organ doses were estimated for four resident ethnic groups in New Mexico (Whites, Hispanics, Native Americans, and African Americans) in seven age groups using: (1) assessment models described in a companion paper, (2) data on the spatial distribution and magnitude of radioactive fallout derived from historical documents, and (3) data collected on diets and lifestyles in 1945 from interviews and focus groups conducted in 2015-2017 (described in a companion paper). The organ doses were found to vary widely across the state with the highest doses directly to the northeast of the detonation site and at locations close to the center of the Trinity fallout plume. Spatial heterogeneity of fallout deposition was the largest cause of variation of doses across the state with lesser differences due to age and ethnicity, the latter because of differences in diets and lifestyles. The exposure pathways considered included both external irradiation from deposited fallout and internal irradiation via inhalation of airborne radionuclides in the debris cloud as well as resuspended ground activity and ingestion of contaminated drinking water (derived both from rivers and rainwater cisterns) and foodstuffs including milk products, beef, mutton, and pork, human-consumed plant products including leafy vegetables, fruit vegetables, fruits, and berries. Tables of best estimates of county population-weighted average organ doses by ethnicity and age are presented. A discussion of our estimates of uncertainty is also provided to illustrate a lower and upper credible range on our best estimates of doses. Our findings indicate that only small geographic areas immediately downwind to the northeast received exposures of any significance as judged by their magnitude relative to natural radiation. The findings presented are the most comprehensive and well-described estimates of doses received by populations of New Mexico from the Trinity nuclear test. To assess the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and atrophic gastritis (AG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) development and to assess the rate of dysplasia or gastric cancer development in patients with AG and/or IM.\\nThis retrospective endoscopic follow-up study enrolled 2214 patients. The patients were followed for at least five years between 2007 and 2017 at the Department of Endoscopy at Antalya Ataturk Government Hospital. The results of third-year and five-year surveillance biopsy were assessed.\\nThe mean follow-up time was 7.77\\u2009±\\u20092.78 years. H. pylori was histologically assessed in 1417 (64.6%) patients. Of 198 patients with severe H. pylori infection, 32 (16%) and 139 (70.3%) developed extensive AG and extensive IM, respectively. There was a significant relationship between H. pylori density and AG and IM degrees. High grade dysplasia, early gastric cancer, and advanced gastric cancer were diagnosed in 73 patients with median age 58.2 (28-80) years, and the incidence rate was 3.29% (73/2214). The annual incidence of gastric neoplastic lesions was 0.46% in total, 0.08% for early GC, and 0.02% for advanced gastric cancer.\\nH. pylori infection has an important role in the development of AG and IM. H. pylori density is directly related to atrophy and metaplasia degree. Early gastric cancers are associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) in 15% of cases. Risk factors for LNM are well established in Eastern countries. Less invasive treatments, such as\\xa0endoscopic or surgical laparoscopic\\xa0resection, are well accepted in Eastern countries and a matter of intense debate in the West, were indications for such treatments are still contested The objective of the study is to determine risk factors related to LNM and to validate endoscopic resection indications.\\nThe study was a retrospective cohort of 178 patients with early gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy. Clinical and pathological factors were analyzed. The new rules of ER from JGCA were applied to the studied cohort.\\nLNM was present in 13.48% of the cases, 3.96% (3/76) in T1a tumors and 20.58% (21/102) in T1b tumors. In univariate analysis ulceration (p\\u2009=\\u20090.04), differentiation grade (p\\u2009=\\u20090.04), submucosal invasion (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), lymphatic invasion (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and vascular invasion (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) were associated with LNM. In multivariate analysis, differentiation grade (p\\u2009=\\u20090.005) and submucosal invasion (p\\u2009=\\u20090.005) were independent risk factors. One patient classified in the expanded criteria group and seven from the relative criteria group had LNM. There were no LNM for undifferentiated mucosal lesions without ulceration.\\nUndifferentiated tumors and submucosal invasion are risks factors associated with LNM in early gastric cancer in our study. Endoscopic Resection or less invasive and radical surgical treatments are an option to be carefully considered. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths. Barrett\\'s oesophagus (BO) is the only known precancerous precursor to OAC, but our understanding about the molecular events leading to OAC development is limited. Here, we have integrated gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles of human biopsies and identified a strong cell cycle gene expression signature in OAC compared to BO. Through analysing associated chromatin accessibility changes, we have implicated the transcription factor KLF5 in the transition from BO to OAC. Importantly, we show that KLF5 expression is unchanged during this transition, but instead, KLF5 is redistributed across chromatin to directly regulate cell cycle genes specifically in OAC cells. This new KLF5 target gene programme has potential prognostic significance as high levels correlate with poorer patient survival. Thus, the repurposing of KLF5 for novel regulatory activity in OAC provides new insights into the mechanisms behind disease progression.\\nAcid fluids present in the gut can sometimes ‘go up’ and damage the oesophagus, the pipe that connects the mouth and the stomach. As a result, a small number of individuals can develop Barrett’s oesophagus, a condition where cells in the lining of the lower oesophagus show abnormal shapes. In certain patients, these cells then become cancerous, but exactly how this happens is unknown. This lack of understanding contributes to late diagnoses, limited treatment and low survival rates. Many cancers feature ‘signature’ mutations in a set of genes that controls how a cell can multiply. Yet, in the case of cancers of the lower oesophagus, known genetic changes have had a limited impact on our understanding of the emergence of the disease. Here, Rogerson et al. focused instead on non-genetic changes and studied transcription factors, the proteins that bind to regulatory regions of the DNA to switch genes on and off. A close inspection of cancer cells in the lower oesophagus revealed that, in that state, a transcription factor called KLF5 controls the abnormal activation of genes involved in cell growth. This is linked to the transcription factor adopting a different pattern of binding onto regulatory regions in diseased cells. Crucially, when the cell growth genes regulated by KLF5 are activated, patients have lower survival rates. Further work is now required to examine whether this finding could help to identify patients who are most at risk from developing cancer. More broadly, the results from the work by Rogerson et al. demonstrate how transcription factors can be repurposed in a disease context. Helicobacter pylori is a common component of the human stomach microbiota, possibly dating back to the speciation of Homo sapiens. A history of pathogen evolution in allopatry has led to the development of genetically distinct H. pylori subpopulations, associated with different human populations, and more recent admixture among H. pylori subpopulations can provide information about human migrations. However, little is known about the degree to which some H. pylori genes are conserved in the face of admixture, potentially indicating host adaptation, or how virulence genes spread among different populations. We analyzed H. pylori genomes from 14 countries in the Americas, strains from the Iberian Peninsula, and public genomes from Europe, Africa, and Asia, to investigate how admixture varies across different regions and gene families. Whole-genome analyses of 723 H. pylori strains from around the world showed evidence of frequent admixture in the American strains with a complex mosaic of contributions from H. pylori populations originating in the Americas as well as other continents. Despite the complex admixture, distinctive genomic fingerprints were identified for each region, revealing novel American H. pylori subpopulations. A pan-genome Fst analysis showed that variation in virulence genes had the strongest fixation in America, compared with non-American populations, and that much of the variation constituted non-synonymous substitutions in functional domains. Network analyses suggest that these virulence genes have followed unique evolutionary paths in the American populations, spreading into different genetic backgrounds, potentially contributing to the high risk of gastric cancer in the region. We report a case of a 77-year-old male who had been diagnosed with normal-flow high-pressure gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS) two years previously. In accordance with his wishes, it was decided not to perform surgery. He visited our hospital with anorexia and weight loss and was diagnosed with gastric cancer. Echocardiography showed a change to paradoxical low-flow low-pressure gradient severe AS (PLFLPG AS). A decrease in stroke volume is typically associated with a smaller LV size, but the reason for a smaller LV size in PLFLPG AS remains unclear. In this case, the change to PLFLPG AS was thought to be due to a decrease in whole body oxygen consumption, and this may help to understand the pathology. For resectable gastric cancer, although radical surgery is still the main treatment, methods of operation and the curative effect of operation are still in the stage of exploration for metastatic gastric cancer. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy also play an important role in prolonging the survival period of patients with gastric cancer. Postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy can prolong the survival time, but for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer, the preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also further improve the survival period of patients compared with direct operation. In addition, with the development and using of molecular targeted drugs, such as antiangiogenic agents, immunosuppressive drugs and so on, the survival period of patients with gastric cancer has been further extended.\\n对于可切除胃癌而言，根治性手术仍然作为治疗的核心手段，但对于转移性胃癌而言，手术方式的选择和手术效果需要探索。放射治疗(以下简称放疗)、化学治疗(以下简称化疗)、分子靶向治疗在延长胃癌患者生存期中发挥了重要的作用，术后放疗、化疗可以延长生存期，对于局部晚期的胃癌患者，术前行放疗、化疗相比于直接手术，亦能进一步延长患者的生存期。另外，随着分子靶向药物(如抗血管生成药物、免疫抑制药物等)的研发和使用，胃癌患者的生存期可进一步延长。. Gastric cancer (GC) has substantial biological differences between Asian and non-Asian populations, which makes it difficult to have a unified predictive measure for all people. We aimed to identify novel prognostic biomarkers to help predict the prognosis of Asian GC patients.\\nWe investigated the differential gene expression between GC and normal tissues of GSE66229. Univariate, multivariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses were conducted to establish a four-gene-related prognostic model based on the risk score. The risk score was based on a linear combination of the expression levels of individual genes multiplied by their multivariate Cox regression coefficients. Validation of the prognostic model was conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A nomogram containing clinical characteristics and the prognostic model was established to predict the prognosis of Asian GC patients.\\nFour genes (RBPMS2, RGN, PLEKHS1, CT83) were selected to establish the prognostic model, and it was validated in the TCGA Asian cohort. Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of the prognostic model. Based on the prognostic model, a nomogram containing clinical characteristics and the prognostic model was established, and Harrell\\'s concordance index of the nomogram for evaluating the overall survival significantly higher than the model only focuses on the pathologic stage (0.74 vs. 0.64, p < 0.001).\\nThe four-gene-related prognostic model and the nomogram based on it are reliable tools for predicting the OS of Asian GC patients. Persistent infections with the human pathogen  We present the case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with a cystic pancreatic lesion, suggestive of a serous cystadenoma of 27/13 mm. The diagnosis was established by the examination of abdominal CT and eco-endoscopy. The patient was referred to the surgery department for treatment. The benign etiology suggested by imaging and the desire to preserve the spleen along with as much of the pancreatic parenchyma, indicated a laparoscopic central pancreatectomy with a anastomosis between the distal pancreatic stump and the stomach. The authors reviewed the national and international publications related to the indications of this minimally invasive surgery. Post-gastrectomy complications have been the associated sequelae after curative gastrectomy for long time. They include a conundrum of symptoms ranging from serious metabolic alterations to disorders attributed to mechanical and neural factors after reconstruction of the digestive continuity. Though, with the advancement in the surgical expertise and techniques and shift towards medical and endoscopic management for benign gastro-duodenal ulcer disease, there has been a decline in the incidence of these complications; they continue to raise \"red flags\" after major oncologic gastric resections. Identification of these symptoms and protocol based management of the same is of utmost importance in the surgical armamentarium of trainees and practicing physicians and surgeons. The reported incidence of duplicate left gastric artery is not very low, with a rate of 0.4%. However, there have been no reports of the surgical management of patients with a duplicate left gastric artery. Here, we report a 60-year-old Japanese man diagnosed with clinical T1bN0M0 stage IA gastric cancer. Preoperative 5-mm slice CT showed no anatomical abnormality, and the patient underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. When we dissected the nerve plexus around the left gastric artery with an ultrasonic vessel-sealing device, pulsating bleeding was observed from a small vessel in the nerve plexus. The bleeding was stopped by suture and clipping. A 1.2-mm vessel was identified on 1-mm slice preoperative CT and postoperative CT angiography. The patient was discharged without any complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient undergoing surgery for a duplicate left gastric artery. Using a nationwide cohort, we investigated the cancer risk in Korean patients with gout.\\nData were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Database. Patients with gout were defined as those aged ≥ 20 years who were diagnosed with gout and received anti-gout medication (allopurinol, colchicine, and benzbromarone) between 2008 and 2010. Patients with nail disorders were randomly assigned to a control group (1:1 ratio) after frequency matching for age and sex. Cancer incidence was then investigated between 2012 and 2018. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the association between gout and cancer after adjusting for concomitant diseases.\\nThis study included 179,930 patients with gout and an equal number of matched controls. The incidence of overall cancer was higher in patients with gout than in controls (incidence rate ratio 1.08). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that gout was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.053 (95% confidence interval 1.031-1.077) after adjusting for concomitant diseases.\\nGout was associated with a significantly high risk of cancer, especially esophageal, stomach, colon, liver, pancreatic, lung, ovarian, renal, and bladder cancers. Gastric cancer is a common gastrointestinal tumor, seriously threatening human health. Radical surgery is the preferred treatment for gastric cancer. However, due to the late diagnosis and postoperative recurrence and metastasis, the prognosis is dismal. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat gastric cancer for many years. The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Yiqi Huayu Jiedu decoction in the treatment of postoperative gastric caner.\\n226 eligibility patients altogether will be randomly allocated to the treatment group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1. After enrollment, every patients will obtain 6 months of treatment, as well as 2 years of follow-up. At the end of this study, primary outcomes including 1-year progression-free survival rate, 2-year progression-free survival rate and disease-free survival, secondary outcomes containing tumor markers, TCM syndrome points, quality of life scale, imageological examination and the safety indicators will be assessed.\\nThis study will provide the evidence-based evidence for the efficacy of Yiqi Huayu Jiedu decoction reducing the risk of postoperative gastric cancer recurrence and metastasis, which will be beneficial to form the therapeutic regimen in postoperative gastric cancer with integrated TCM and Western medicine.\\nChiCTR2000032802. To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and relevant prognostic factors of gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (GEP-NEN), to improve our understanding of GEP-NEN.This was a retrospective analysis of 155 patients (average age 53.7\\u200a±\\u200a13.6 years) pathologically diagnosed with GEP-NEN. We analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, and prognostic factors of GEP-NEN.The most common primary site was the pancreas (41.9%), followed by the rectum, stomach and duodenum. Most cases were nonfunctional GEP-NENs (149/155) with nonspecific symptoms. TNM stage and histological grade were determined by the latest criteria. Surgical resection was the mainstay of treatment in 150 patients, and 22 patients received chemotherapy under different circumstances. A total of 130 patients were followed up for a median of 44 months, and 1-year and 3-year survival rates were 82.3% and 72.3%, respectively. According to univariate and multivariate analysis, incidental diagnosis, maximum tumor diameter, tumor stage, lymph node and distant metastasis, TNM stage, and histological grade were significantly correlated with overall survival, but histological grade was the only factor confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for long-term survival of GEP-NEN.GEP-NEN, with an increasing trend in incidence, occurred most frequently in the pancreas. Nonfunctional tumors with nonspecific symptoms comprised the majority of cases. The main treatment was surgical resection. Histological grade was confirmed as the only independent prognostic factor. Upper gastrointestinal stenting is a palliative treatment for relieving symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and dietary intake in patients with obstruction due to inoperable advanced stomach cancer. Self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) implantation for malignant obstruction has recently become more effective, safer, and less expensive than operative modality. It also has better short-term outcomes, particularly a shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to oral intake, than surgical treatment. However, there is no comparative analysis regarding the efficacy, side effects, and survival rate of stenting between the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and pyloric obstructions.To compare the prognoses and complications after SEMS implantation between EGJ and pyloric obstructions in advanced gastric cancer.Among advanced gastric cancer patients with gastrointestinal obstruction diagnosed from January 2008 to December 2017 at the Gastroenterology Department of Chungnam National University Hospital, 42 and 76 patients presented with EGJ (EGJ obstruction group) and gastric pyloric obstructions (pyloric obstruction group), respectively. We retrospectively reviewed the survival period, changes in food intake, and complications of these patients before and after SEMS placement.The prevalences of aspiration pneumonia were 11.9% (5/42) and 2.6% (2/76) in the EGJ and pyloric obstruction groups, respectively, before SEMS placement (P value: .041). Other symptoms associated with gastric malignant obstruction were not statistically different between the groups. Success rate and adverse events did not significantly differ between the EGJ and pyloric obstruction groups. There was no difference in frequency of stent reinsertion procedures performed owing to reobstruction, but the reprocedure average period was statistically significantly longer in the EGJ obstruction group [EGJ obstruction: 158.3 days (±42.4); pyloric obstruction: 86.0 days (±29.1)] (P value: .022). As an index of improved dietary status, the Gastric Outlet Obstruction Scoring System score was not significantly different between the groups before and after SEMS placement.The EGJ and pyloric obstruction groups did not significantly differ in prognosis or complication rates. However, EGJ stent was more stable than pyloric stent when reobstruction was considered. Early gastric cancer is the fifth common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer death throughout the world. However, it is not clear how endoscopic screening for early gastric cancer affects incidence or mortality. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between endoscopic screening for the mortality and incidence of early gastric cancer.\\nThis protocol established in this study has been reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for cohort and case-control studies in cases without early gastric cancer until March 31, 2020. We will use a combination of Medical Subject Heading and free-text terms with various synonyms to search based on the Eligibility criteria. Two investigators independently reviewed the included studies and extracted relevant data. The relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were used as effect estimate. I-square test, substantial heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias assessment will be performed accordingly. Stata 15.0 and Review Manger 5.3 are used for meta-analysis and systematic review.\\nThe results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\\nThe results of this review will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. This evidence may also provide helpful evidence of whether endoscopic screening would reduce the mortality and incidence of early gastric cancer.\\nCRD42020171053. The lymph nodal invasion diagnosis is critical for therapeutic-decision and follows up in gastric cancer. However, the number of nodes to be examined for nodal invasion diagnosis is still under controversy, and the model for quantifying risk of missing positive node is currently not reported yet. We analyzed the nodal invasion status of 13,857 gastric cancer samples with records of primary tumor stage, the number of examined and positive lymph nodes in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database, fitting a beta-binomial model. The nodes need to be examined with different primary tumor stage were determined based on the model. Overall, examining 11 lymph nodes reduces the probability of missing positive nodes to <10%, and the currently median nodes dissected is adequate (12 nodes). While the number of nodes demands to be dissected for T1, T2, T3, and T4 subgroups are 6, 19, 40, and 66, respectively. The currently implemented median value for these samples was 12, 12, 13, and 16, separately. It implies that the number of nodes to be examined is sufficient for early gastric cancer (T1), but it is inadequate for middle and advanced gastric cancer (T2-T3). The clinical significance of nodal staging score was validated with survival information. In summary, we first quantified the lymph nodes to be examined during surgery using a beta-binomial model, and validated with survival information. With the recent increased use of lanthanum carbonate, several cases of lanthanum phosphate deposition to gastric mucosa in dialysis patients have been reported. However, the endoscopic appearance of the early-stage lesion and the over-time alterations of endoscopic findings due to the progression of lanthanum phosphate deposition remain unclear.\\nAn 80-year-old man receiving dialysis and taking lanthanum carbonate as a phosphate binder over a 4-year period underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy four times beginning 1\\u2009year after initiation of treatment. The first endoscopic examination (after 1\\u2009year of exposure to lanthanum carbonate) revealed rough mucosa with a few areas of white granular mucosa. Over the 3\\u2009years of endoscopic follow-up, the white granular mucosa spread and multiple erosions appeared. Histopathological findings of biopsy specimens from an erosion showed extensive infiltration by histiocytes containing deposits. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) revealed that the presence of the deposits containing phosphorus and lanthanum in the gastric mucosa. On the basis of these results, the patient was diagnosed with gastropathy associated with lanthanum phosphate deposition.\\nOver a 3-year period, endoscopic findings associated with lanthanum deposition gradually changed and expanded from the early stage.   Recent reports indicate that preoperative patients with gastrointestinal malignancies often have sarcopenia. The diagnosis of sarcopenia is generally done by evaluation of walking speed, grip strength, and skeletal muscle volume of the limbs on computed tomography (CT). However, these parameters are objective indices, and new indicators for diagnosis, such as molecular biomarkers, have been anticipated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether titin, a muscular contractile protein present in sarcomeres, is an indicator of sarcopenia.\\nWe analyzed 39 patients with gastrointestinal tract and hepatobiliary pancreatic malignancies who underwent surgery. We compared urinary titin n-terminal fragment concentration (UTF) with clinical factors, subcutaneous fat volume, and skeletal muscle volume index, and also compared UTF levels between patients with and without sarcopenia.\\nThe patients comprised 24 men and 15 women, with a mean age of 72 y (range: 35-85 y). Cancer locations were the pancreas (n\\xa0=\\xa017), liver (n\\xa0=\\xa09), stomach (n\\xa0=\\xa05), colorectum (n\\xa0=\\xa05), and esophagus (n\\xa0=\\xa03). UTF was significantly higher in patients with sarcopenia (P\\xa0=\\xa00.04), and showed statistically significant negative correlations with albumin (r\\xa0=\\xa0-2.61, P\\xa0=\\xa00.001), pre-albumin (r\\xa0=\\xa0-2.14, P\\xa0=\\xa00.02), body mass index (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.49, P\\xa0=\\xa00.007), cholinesterase (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.02, P\\xa0=\\xa00.01, skeletal muscle volume index (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.16, P\\xa0=\\xa00.04), and subcutaneous fat volume (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.03, P\\xa0=\\xa00.007).\\nUTF may be a new index for preoperative nutritional assessment in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Gastric adenosquamous carcinoma (GASC) is a rare variant of gastric cancer; the limited data available suggest that these tumors are more aggressive and have a worse outcome in comparison to gastric adenocarcinoma. Currently, the management of GASC is similar to adenocarcinoma. We report a case of GASC that progressed rapidly despite treatment. There have been very few reports of patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) and colorectal cancer combined with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).\\nWe report the case of a patient with multiple tumors that were found at the same time in the abdomen. The patient was a 77-year-old man who was referred for a gastric GIST. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed the known lesion (a gastric GIST) on the lesser curvature of the upper body and a new lesion on the lesser curvature of the lower body of the stomach with suspicion of EGC. Computed tomography findings confirmed the presence of a GIST in the stomach and revealed two new lesions. One of these lesions was suspected to be a 4-cm submucosal tumor on the anterior wall of the upper body of the stomach. The other was a wall thickening of the descending colon that demonstrated the possibility of malignancy. Synchronous colon cancer was confirmed on colonoscopy. Laparoscopic near-total gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and left hemicolectomy were performed sequentially without significant events. The patient was discharged without any postoperative complications.\\nWe reported a rare case of EGC with multiple gastric GISTs combined with synchronous colon cancer. Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death globally. Risk factors for the condition include Helicobacter pylori infection, age, high salt intake, and diets low in fruit and vegetables. Gastric cancer is diagnosed histologically after endoscopic biopsy and staged using CT, endoscopic ultrasound, PET, and laparoscopy. It is a molecularly and phenotypically highly heterogeneous disease. The main treatment for early gastric cancer is endoscopic resection. Non-early operable gastric cancer is treated with surgery, which should include D2 lymphadenectomy (including lymph node stations in the perigastric mesentery and along the celiac arterial branches). Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers. Advanced gastric cancer is treated with sequential lines of chemotherapy, starting with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet in the first line; median survival is less than 1 year. Targeted therapies licensed to treat gastric cancer include trastuzumab (HER2-positive patients first line), ramucirumab (anti-angiogenic second line), and nivolumab or pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 third line). Gastric cancer perforation is rare and difficult to distinguish from gastric ulcer perforation before surgery. Peritonitis caused by gastric perforation requires emergency surgery. The optimal surgical strategy for gastric perforation has not been established.\\nData from 43 patients who underwent primary gastrectomy with curative intent for gastric perforation between June 2010 and November 2019 were reviewed. Patients were classified into gastric ulcer and gastric cancer groups. Early surgical outcomes and overall survival were assessed.\\nThere were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups except regarding preoperative shock. Laparoscopic gastrectomy was performed in 35 of 43 patients. There were no conversions to open surgery. The surgical findings demonstrated that the gastric cancer group had larger mass lesions with significantly larger perforations than did the gastric ulcer group. There were no significant differences in early surgical outcomes. Severe postoperative complications occurred in nine patients, five of whom died within one month of surgery. The majority of patients (90%) had stage III or IV gastric cancer. The 5-year survival rate was 19.5%.\\nWe found no definitive differences in clinical characteristics distinguishing gastric cancer from ulcers. Considering our surgical outcomes, laparoscopic primary gastrectomy performed by an expert is a useful technique for emergency gastric perforation. However, unless an expert is available, caution should be used when selecting laparoscopic primary gastrectomy with curative intent as a surgical method. Increasing evidence indicates that TP53 mutation impacts the patients\\' prognosis by regulating the gastric cancer (GC) immunophenotype. An immune prognostic signature (IPS) was constructed based on TP53 status. The effects of the IPS on the immune microenvironment of GC were analyzed. We also constructed a nomogram integrating the IPS and other clinical factors. An IPS was constructed in the TCGA cohort and validated in the meta-GEO cohort. TP53 mutation resulted in the downregulation of the immune response in GC. Concretely, high-risk patients were characterized by increased monocyte, macrophage M0 and T cell follicular helper infiltration; increased stromal score, ESTIMATE score and immune score; higher TIM3 and BTLA expression; and decreased dendritic cell and T cell CD4 memory-activated infiltration and tumor purity. The nomogram also showed good predictive performance. These results suggest that the IPS is an effective prognostic indicator for GC patients, which might provide a theoretical foundation for immunotherapy. About 4% of patients with stomach cancer diagnosis have synchronous colorectal cancer and some of these patients may require a synchronous surgical resection. So far, only few minimally invasive series of synchronous resections have been described. We investigated the feasibility and safety of the synchronous robotic resection of the right colon and stomach malignancies, trying to identify a standardised and reproducible technique. It is essential to carefully plan the operation and the trocars positioning to minimise the number of robotic dockings and be able to operate comfortably. Herein, we describe our approach, which is safe and effective in terms of minimal invasiveness and oncological radicality. Robotic surgery could be used with even more advantage in complex multi-organ resections, providing the surgeon with a better vision, a more accurate dissection and longer instruments, to offer the patient all the benefits of a minimal invasive surgery. Delayed diagnosis of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite progress in systemic therapy and radiotherapy, there has only been a slight improvement in the five-year survival rate. A non-invasive diagnostic method that consists of an assessment of specific proteins in saliva samples may significantly facilitate assessment of treatment results in patients diagnosed with oral and oropharyngeal cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of IL-17 and TNF- A 79-year-old female with a past medical history of multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease presented to the hospital with generalized weakness. The patient was found to have a firm abdominal wall mass with no underlying skin changes or drainage on physical examination. Computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed a large mass-like structure in the anterior abdominal wall in the subcutaneous region extending into the abdomen through the mesentery with juxtaposition and partial involvement of the left hepatic lobe and distal stomach. Solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas are extremely rare tumors that occur outside of the bone marrow in the absence of systemic involvement. This case reports details the finding of an extramedullary plasmacytomas, which accounts for less than 5% of plasma cell neoplasms. The early detection and accurate histopathological diagnosis of gastric cancer increase the chances of successful treatment. The worldwide shortage of pathologists offers a unique opportunity for the use of artificial intelligence assistance systems to alleviate the workload and increase diagnostic accuracy. Here, we report a clinically applicable system developed at the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China, using a deep convolutional neural network trained with 2,123 pixel-level annotated H&E-stained whole slide images. The model achieves a sensitivity near 100% and an average specificity of 80.6% on a real-world test dataset with 3,212 whole slide images digitalized by three scanners. We show that the system could aid pathologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and preventing misdiagnoses. Moreover, we demonstrate that our system performs robustly with 1,582 whole slide images from two other medical centres. Our study suggests the feasibility and benefits of using histopathological artificial intelligence assistance systems in routine practice scenarios. Child maltreatment leads to enormous adverse short- and long-term health outcomes. The aim of this study is to estimate the burden of disease and the cost of illness attributable to child maltreatment in Japan.\\nAn incidence-based top-down cost of illness analysis was conducted to estimate medical costs and burden of disease attributable to child maltreatment based on a societal perspective. The assessment included short-term and long-term medical costs and burden of disease measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) that generates mortality and morbidities, based on several national surveys and systematic review. We considered the main types of child maltreatment as exposure, for which the incidence was obtained from literature review. Based on population attributable fractions (PAFs), burden of disease of physical and mental health consequences attributable to child maltreatment were estimated. Then DALYs were converted into monetary value. The lifetime economic burden was finally estimated by combining with medical costs and subject to sensitivity analysis.\\nThe lifetime disease burden expressed in DALYs was estimated at 1,047,580 DALYs (95% CI 788,388 - 1326,80 DALYs) for the cohort victims in 2016. Based on the incidence according to literature review, the overall lifetime economic burden was 50.24 billion USD, equivalent to 1.3 million times of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Among the total economic burden, costs of suffering and pain based on DALYs were accounting for 81.3%. These estimates were 7-8 times of conservative estimates which used incidence data from official reported cases.\\nThis study found that the national lifetime cost was huge and equivalent to 1.3 million GDP per capita, and its burden of disease was approximately equal to that of colon and rectum cancers or stomach cancer. Our findings particularly in terms of revealed the considerable burden of disease in long term and potential effects of the strengthened maternal and child care as the preventive strategy. None  Gastric sarcomatoid carcinoma (GSC) is a very rare malignant tumor. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical, computed tomography (CT), and pathologic features of GSC to increase awareness of this entity.\\nThe CT features and clinical data of five patients with pathologically documented GSC were retrospectively analyzed and compared with the corresponding data of gastric adenocarcinoma and lymphoma.\\nAmong the 5 patients, 4 were male, and 1 was female. The median age was 59 years. Of the 5 cases of GSC, 3 were in the gastric fundus and cardia, 1 was in the gastric body, and 1 was in the gastric fundus. The gastric wall had local thickening in 4 cases and mass formation in 1 case, with stenosis and deformation of the adjacent gastric cavity. The long-axis diameter of the lesions ranged from 1.4 to 10.2 cm (mean, 4.97 cm) and was <10 cm in 4 cases and >10 cm in 1 case. The tumor showed predominantly inhomogeneous density, with radiodensity values ranging from 30 to 53 HU. In addition, ulcers with an irregular base and slightly raised borders were observed in 4 of 5 cases. After an injection of contrast material, heterogeneous (\\nAlthough GSC is extremely rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and lymphoma. CT findings, combined with patient age and sex, can provide support for the diagnosis of GSC. However, the final diagnosis must be confirmed with histopathology. Cancer has an important and considerable gender differential susceptibility confirmed by several epidemiological studies. Gastric (GC) and thyroid cancer (TC) are examples of malignancies with a higher incidence in males and females, respectively. Beyond environmental predisposing factors, it is expected that gender-specific gene deregulation contributes to this differential incidence. We performed a detailed characterization of the transcriptomic differences between genders in normal and tumor tissues from stomach and thyroid using Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We found hundreds of sex-biased genes (SBGs). Most of the SBGs shared by normal and tumor belong to sexual chromosomes, while the normal and tumor-specific tend to be found in the autosomes. Expression of several cancer-associated genes is also found to differ between sexes in both types of tissue. Thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between paired tumor-normal tissues were identified in GC and TC. For both cancers, in the most susceptible gender, the DEGs were mostly under-expressed in the tumor tissue, with an enrichment for tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs). Moreover, we found gene networks preferentially associated to males in GC and to females in TC and correlated with cancer histological subtypes. Our results shed light on the molecular differences and commonalities between genders and provide novel insights in the differential risk underlying these cancers. The use of biomarkers in diagnosis, therapy and prognosis has gained increasing interest over the last decades. In particular, the analysis of biomarkers in cancer patients within the pre- and post-therapeutic period is required to identify several types of cells, which carry a risk for a disease progression and subsequent post-therapeutic relapse. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells that can drive tumor initiation and can cause relapses. At the time point of tumor initiation, CSCs originate from either differentiated cells or adult tissue resident stem cells. Due to their importance, several biomarkers that characterize CSCs have been identified and correlated to diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. However, CSCs have been shown to display a high plasticity, which changes their phenotypic and functional appearance. Such changes are induced by chemo- and radiotherapeutics as well as senescent tumor cells, which cause alterations in the tumor microenvironment. Induction of senescence causes tumor shrinkage by modulating an anti-tumorigenic environment in which tumor cells undergo growth arrest and immune cells are attracted. Besides these positive effects after therapy, senescence can also have negative effects displayed post-therapeutically. These unfavorable effects can directly promote cancer stemness by increasing CSC plasticity phenotypes, by activating stemness pathways in non-CSCs, as well as by promoting senescence escape and subsequent activation of stemness pathways. At the end, all these effects can lead to tumor relapse and metastasis. This review provides an overview of the most frequently used CSC markers and their implementation as biomarkers by focussing on deadliest solid (lung, stomach, liver, breast and colorectal cancers) and hematological (acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia) cancers. Furthermore, it gives examples on how the CSC markers might be influenced by therapeutics, such as chemo- and radiotherapy, and the tumor microenvironment. It points out, that it is crucial to identify and monitor residual CSCs, senescent tumor cells, and the pro-tumorigenic senescence-associated secretory phenotype in a therapy follow-up using specific biomarkers. As a future perspective, a targeted immune-mediated strategy using chimeric antigen receptor based approaches for the removal of remaining chemotherapy-resistant cells as well as CSCs in a personalized therapeutic approach are discussed. In representative species of all vertebrate classes, the oral ejection of upper digestive tract contents by vomiting or regurgitation is used to void food contaminated with toxins or containing indigestible material not voidable in the feces. Vomiting or regurgitation has been reported in a number of invertebrate marine species ( Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) is a statistical method that has been widely used in recent years to explore gene co-expression modules. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) is commonly involved in the cancer gene expression regulation mechanism. Some ceRNA networks are recognized in gastric cancer; however, the prognosis-associated ceRNA network has not been fully identified using WGCNA. We performed WGCNA using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to identify cancer-associated modules. The criteria of differentially expressed RNAs between normal stomach samples and gastric cancer samples were set at the false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01 and |fold change (FC)| > 1.3. The ceRNA relationships obtained from the RNAinter database were examined by both the Pearson correlation test and hypergeometric test to confirm the mRNA-lncRNA regulation. Overlapped genes were recognized at the intersections of genes predicted by ceRNA relationships, differentially expressed genes, and genes in cancer-specific modules. These were then used for univariate and multivariate Cox analyses to construct a risk score model. The ceRNA network was constructed based on the genes in this model. WGCNA-uncovered genes in the green and turquoise modules are those most associated with gastric cancer. Eighty differentially expressed genes were observed to have potential prognostic value, which led to the identification of 12 prognosis-related mRNAs ( Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent and lethal tumors affecting human health worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer effects of Xiaoai Jiedu Recipe (XJR) on HCC development and its underlying mechanisms.\\nThe expression of microRNA-29a (miR-29a) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in HCC tissues and cells was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells were measured by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, wound-healing, and transwell assays, respectively. The regulatory relationship between miR-29a and STAT3 in HCC was predicted by TargetScan and analyzed by luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. The protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 and STAT3 was detected by Western blotting. A xenograft tumor mouse model was established, and tumor weight and volume were measured.\\nThe expression of miR-29a was significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cells compared with that in normal tissues and cells. The up-regulation of miR-29a was related with lymph node metastasis and tumor node metastasis stage. XJR treatment significantly increased the expression of miR-29a, decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion, and reduced the protein expression of MMP-2/9 in HCC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-tumor effect of XJR on HCC cells was reversed by treatment with miR-29a inhibitor. STAT3 was predicted as a target of miR-29a, and its expression was negatively regulated by miR-29a. Moreover, STAT3 knockdown suppressed the malignant behavior of HCC cells, and its anti-tumor function was reversed by treatment with miR-29a inhibitor. Furthermore, XJR treatment inhibited tumor growth in mice through elevating miR-29a expression and inhibiting STAT3 expression.\\nXJR suppressed the development of HCC via regulating miR-29a and STAT3. Hydrogels are soft materials used in an array of biomedical applications. However, the in situ formation of hydrogels at target sites, particularly in dynamic in vivo environments, usually requires a prolonged gelation time and results in poor adhesion. These limitations cause considerable loss of both hydrogel mass and encapsulated therapeutic cargoes, thereby compromising treatment outcomes. Here, we report the development of a hydrogel based on thiourea-catechol reaction to enhance the bioadhesion. Compared with classical bioadhesive hydrogels, our hydrogels show enhanced mechanical properties, exceedingly short curing time, and pH-independent gelation with a much lower oxidant concentration. We further report the robust adhesion of our hydrogels to acidic gastric tissues and easy delivery to the porcine stomach via endoscopy. The delivered hydrogels adhered to ulcer sites in vivo for at least 48 hours. Hydrogel treatment of gastric ulcers in rodent and porcine models accelerated ulcer healing by suppressing inflammation and promoting re-epithelization and angiogenesis. The improved retention of proregenerative growth factors and reduced exposure to external catabolic factors after hydrogel application may contribute to the observed therapeutic outcomes. Our findings reveal a promising biomaterial-based approach for treating gastrointestinal diseases. Targeted cancer therapy aims to achieve specific elimination of cancerous but not normal cells. Recently, PIWI proteins, a subfamily of the PAZ-PIWI domain (PPD) protein family, have emerged as promising candidates for targeted cancer therapy. PPD proteins are essential for small noncoding RNA pathways. The Argonaute subfamily partners with microRNA and small interfering RNA, whereas the PIWI subfamily partners with PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA). Both PIWI proteins and piRNA are mostly expressed in the germline and best known for their function in transposon silencing, with no detectable function in mammalian somatic tissues. However, PIWI proteins become aberrantly expressed in multiple types of somatic cancers, thus gaining interest in targeted therapy. Despite this, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of PIWI proteins in cancer. Here we report that one of the four PIWI proteins in humans, PIWIL1, is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Knocking out the PIWIL1 gene ( Occupational exposure to agents in plastics and rubber manufacturing has been associated with elevated risk of certain cancers. We sought to evaluate cancer risk among workers employed in occupations and industries with these exposures as part of an ongoing surveillance programme in Ontario, Canada.\\nThe Occupational Disease Surveillance System (ODSS) cohort was established using workers\\' compensation claims data and includes 2.18\\u2009million workers employed from 1983 to 2014. Workers were followed for site-specific cancer diagnoses in the Ontario Cancer Registry through 2016. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted HR and 95% CI.\\nWe identified 81\\u2009127 workers employed in plastics and rubber manufacturing industries or materials processing and product fabricating occupations. Compared with all other women in the ODSS, those in materials processing occupations had an elevated rate of lung cancer (HR 1.38, 95%\\u2009CI 1.20 to 1.58) that was not observed among men. An elevated rate of breast cancer was observed among female labourers (HR 1.36, 95%\\u2009CI 1.01 to 1.82) and moulders (HR 1.47, 95%\\u2009CI 0.91 to 2.37) in plastics and rubber product fabricating occupations. Overall, elevated rates were observed for oesophageal, liver, stomach, prostate and kidney cancer in job-specific subgroups, including mixing and blending, bonding and cementing, and labouring. There was little evidence of association for lymphatic or haematopoietic cancers.\\nFindings for lung and breast cancer in women are consistent with other studies and warrant further attention in Ontario. Given the relatively young age at end of follow-up, surveillance in these workers should continue as the cohort ages. Huaier granules, the aqueous product of Huaier (Trametes robiniophila Murr.) extract, are a broad-spectrum anti-tumor drug and have been widely used for the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the efficacy and safety of Huaier granules combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of GC.\\nThree English databases and four Chinese databases will be searched from its inception to July 2020. Two methodological trained researchers will select the qualified studies for data extraction independently. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool will be used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. The RevMan 5.2 and stata 14.0 software will be applied for statistical analyses. Statistical heterogeneity will be computed by Cochrane X and I tests. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to evaluate the stability of the results. The publication bias will be evaluated by funnel plots and Egger\\'s test. The quality of evidence will be assessed by the GRADE system.\\nThe results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\\nThe conclusion of our systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether Huaier granules combined with chemotherapy is an effective intervention for patient with GC.\\n10.17605/OSF.IO/9BVJD. Processed meats are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as category 1 because their consumption increase the incidence of colorectal and stomach cancers. Meat processing widely employs nitrite and sorbate as preservatives. When these preservatives are concomitantly used in non-compliant processes, they may react and produce the mutagen 2-methyl-1,4-dinitro-pyrrole (DNMP). This study aimed to evaluate the ability of different bacteria isolated from food matrices to biodegrade DNMP in in vitro reactions and in a processed meat model. A possible mechanism of biodegradation was also tested. In vitro experiments were performed in two steps. In the first one, only one strain out of 13 different species did not interact with DNMP. In the following step, an empirical conversion factor was calculated to assess the conversion of DNMP to 4-amino-2-methyl-1-nitro-pyrrole by the strains. The most efficient strains were Staphylococcus xylosus LYOCARNI SXH-01, Lactobacillus fermentum LB-UFSC 0017, and Lactobacillus casei LB-UFSC 0019, which yielded conversion factors of 0.62, 0.60, and 0.43, respectively. Thus, such strains were individually added to the processed meat model and completely degraded the DNMP. Moreover, S. xylosus degraded DNMP in less than 30\\xa0min. The enzymatic mechanism was evaluated using its cell-free extract. It showed that, in the aerobic system, reduction rates were 30.321 and 22.411\\xa0nmol/mg of protein/min using NADH and NADPH, respectively. A DNMP reductase was assigned to the extract and a potential presence of an oxygen insensitive nitroreductase type I B was considered. Thus, biotechnological processes may be an efficient strategy to eliminate the DNMP from meat products and to increase food safety. None Since the publication of the first Brazilian Consensus on Gastric Cancer (GC) in 2012 carried out by the Brazilian Gastric Cancer Association, new concepts on diagnosis, staging, treatment and follow-up have been incorporated.\\nThis new consensus is to promote an update to professionals working in the fight against GC and to provide guidelines for the management of patients with this condition.\\nFifty-nine experts answered 67 statements regarding the diagnosis, staging, treatment and prognosis of GC with five possible alternatives: 1) fully agree; 2) partially agree; 3) undecided; 4) disagree and 5) strongly disagree A consensus was adopted when at least 80% of the sum of the answers \"fully agree\" and \"partially agree\" was reached. This article presents only the responses of the participating experts. Comments on each statement, as well as a literature review, will be presented in future publications.\\nOf the 67 statements, there was consensus in 50 (74%). In 10 declarations, there was 100% agreement.\\nThe gastric cancer treatment has evolved considerably in recent years. This consensus gathers consolidated principles in the last decades, new knowledge acquired recently, as well as promising perspectives on the management of this disease. Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors are rare, usually presented as subepithelial or polypoid tumors. Accurate diagnosis and indication of the type of resection are still challenging.\\nTo determine the effectiveness of echoendoscopy in determining the depth of the lesions (T) identified by endoscopy in order to evaluate surgical and/or endoscopic indication, and to evaluate the results of endoscopic removal in the medium term.\\nTwenty-seven patients were included, all of whom underwent echoendoscopy for TN tumor staging and the evaluation of possible endoscopic resection. The parameters were: lesion size, origin layer, depth of involvement and identified perilesional adenopathies. The inclusion criteria for endoscopic resection were: 1) high surgical risk; 2) those with NET <2 cm; 3) absence of impairment of the muscle itself; and 4) absence of perilesional adenopathies in echoendoscopy and in others without distant metastases. Exclusion criteria were TNE> 2 cm; those with infiltration of the muscle itself; with perilesional adenopathies and distant metastases. The techniques used were: resection with polypectomy loop; mucosectomy with saline injection; and mucosectomy after ligation with an elastic band. The anatomopathological study of the specimens included evaluation of the margins and immunohistochemistry (chromogranin, synaptophysin and Ki 67) to characterize the tumor. Follow-up was done at 1, 6 and 12 months.\\nResections with polypectomy loop were performed in 15 patients; mucosectomy in five; mucosectomy and ligation with elastic band in three and the remaining four were referred for surgery. The anatomopathological specimens and immunohistochemical analyzes showed positive chromogranin and synaptophysin, while Ki 67 was less than 5% among all cases. The medium-term follow-up revealed three recurrences. The average size of tumors in the stomach was 7.6 mm and in the duodenum 7.2 mm. Well-demarcated, hypoechoic, homogeneous lesions occurred in 75%; mucous layer in 80%; and the deep and submucosal mucosa in 70%.\\nEchoendoscopy proved to be a good method for the study of subepithelial lesions, being able to identify the layer affected by the neoplasm, degree of invasion, echogenicity, heterogeneity, size of the lesion and perilesional lymph node involvement and better indicate the treatment option. It seems impossible to reconstruct the esophagus of patients with middle thoracic esophageal carcinoma with a history of distal gastrectomy using the remnant stomach. Although surgeons have made multiple efforts to reconstruct the esophagus using the remnant stomach, it can only be successfully used in cases of lower thoracic esophageal cancer. Additionally, the surgery is more complex than traditional esophagogastrostomy due to challenges including mobilization of the remnant stomach with the spleen and transposition of the pancreatic tail into the left hemithorax. Our operation proved that the remnant stomach, which we named as the completely mobilized remnant stomach after dissection of the feeding vessels, remained viable. We successfully integrated the completely mobilized remnant stomach in the reconstruction of the lower thoracic esophageal tract and then integrated it in Ivor Lewis esophagogastrostomy. We describe this new alternative surgical technique for the treatment of middle thoracic esophageal carcinoma in patients with a history of distal gastrectomy in this study. Clinical data of 23 patients from 2008 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent the Ivor Lewis procedure. All remaining vessels of the remnant stomach were dissected at their origins, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction or Braun anastomosis was performed. After esophagectomy during right thoracotomy, anastomosis of the remnant stomach and esophagus was performed. Two-field lymph node dissections were performed. There was no case of necrosis of the remnant stomach or of perioperative death. Serious complications included anastomotic leak in three cases, afferent-efferent loop syndrome in one, and anastomotic stricture in two. Application of the completely mobilized remnant stomach in Ivor Lewis esophagogastrostomy is feasible, and the surgical procedure is similar to that of normal esophagogastrostomy. A 62-year-old man was referred to the Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary (HPB) surgeons with left upper quadrant discomfort. The initial investigations and CT scans revealed a tumour in the pancreatic tail with liver metastases, confirmed on MRI. It was initially thought to be an adenocarcinoma; however, further investigations found that it was a grade 1 neuroendocrine tumour with Ki 67 at 1% and it was agreed that he would undergo a total robotic surgery involving resection of the locally advanced tumour of the tail of pancreas, with the involvement of the stomach, and splenic flexure of the colon with liver metastases. The resulting procedure was a total robotic distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, sleeve resection of stomach, cholecystectomy, atypical resection of two liver lesions and microwave ablation of multiple liver lesions. Four days post-operatively, he was discharged from hospital and commenced adjuvant chemotherapy. He currently enjoys a good quality of life. De novo expressed CD44 isoforms containing exon-v6 are frequently associated with gastric cancer (GC) aggressiveness, and may predict chemotherapy response in vitro. Whether exon-v6 itself is responsible for conferring these properties to CD44v6-containing isoforms remains to be elucidated. CRISPR/Cas9 and Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomers (PMOs) were used to induce specific exon-v6 skipping, maintaining the CD44 reading frame, in two GC cell lines endogenously expressing CD44v6. Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil treatment response, and self-renewal ability was compared between CRISPR/Cas9-edited, CD44v6 knockdown and mock cells. We obtained homozygous genome-edited cell lines with exon-v6 deletion. Edited cells transcribed CD44v isoforms presenting in frame v5-v7 splicing, mimicking exon-v6 skipping. Results showed that removing specifically exon-v6 sensitizes cells to cisplatin and impairs cells\\' self-renewal ability, similarly to CD44v6 knockdown. In parallel, we also tested a clinically feasible approach for transient exon-v6 skipping with a PMO-based strategy. We demonstrate that exon-v6 specific removal from CD44v isoforms increases cell sensitivity to cisplatin and impairs GC cells self-renewal. We trust that a PMO approach designed towards CD44v6 overexpressing GC cells may be a suitable approach to sensitize tumor cells for conventional therapy. 胃癌是常见的消化道恶性肿瘤，严重威胁人民的生命健康。筛查是降低疾病发生率和死亡率的主要手段，也是防治的重要策略。文章通过检索中国知网、万方数据知识服务平台、PubMed和EMbase等数据库，对国内外胃癌筛查的情况进行总结分析。胃癌筛查地区主要在亚洲东部，筛查方法以胃镜检查和指示性活检为主，筛查起始年龄为40岁及以上。开展高危人群筛查，是中国胃癌防治的重点。.  A total of 189 new cases of gastric cancer in Sheyang County from 2014 to 2018 were selected as the case group, and 189 other people without gastric cancer were matched according to age and gender as the control group. A case-control study was conducted on the relationship between drinking water and gastric cancer. After adjusting BMI, family annual income, dietary taste, monthly pickle consumption, monthly chili consumption, monthly soy product consumption, whether experiencing misfortune, whether suffering from superficial gastritis, whether having family history of gastric cancer, the results of multivariate logistic regression showed that compared with those who had no sources of pollution at the end of drinking water 10 years ago and who mainly consumed boiled water, those who had sources of pollution at the end of drinking water 10 years ago and who only drank raw water had a higher risk of stomach cancer ［\\n选择2014—2018年射阳县189例胃癌新发病例作为病例组，按照年龄、性别匹配189名其他未患胃癌人群作为对照组，开展居民饮水情况与胃癌关联的病例对照研究。多因素logistic回归模型结果显示，调整体重指数、家庭年收入、饮食口味、每月腌菜食用量、每月辣椒食用量、每月豆制品食用量、经历不幸、患浅表性胃炎、胃癌家族史因素后，与10年前饮水末梢无污染源、饮用开水为主者相比，10年前饮水末梢有污染源、只喝生水者胃癌的患病风险较高［ Anatomical subsites always harbor specific biological features in carcinogenesis. The divergent prognosis of proximal gastric cancer (PGC) and distal gastric cancer (DGC) has been reported. The current study aimed to comprehensively interpret anatomic subsite-speciﬁc genomic profiles, which may improve the effectiveness of personalized management.\\nSurvival and genomic data from the online Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were queried for prognostic and genetic analysis, respectively. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to balance patient epidemiological factors. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the DESeq algorithm. Functional enrichment was performed by the clusterProfiler package. The protein-protein interaction network of DEGs was predicted by the online STRING database.\\nA total of 3,955 patient pairs were assembled by PSM in SEER data with even background characteristics. Prognostic analysis indicated worse overall survival of PGC than DGC (17 vs 20 months, p\\u202f=\\u202f0.0002). Genetic analysis of TCGA database identified 280 DEGs, 90 of which were upregulated in the DGC group and the remaining 190 were upregulated in the PGC group. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that kallikrein serine protease activity, ion channel (Na\\nThe current study first demonstrated that PGC exerts poorer survival outcome than DGC based on the SEER database. Further bioinformatic investigation depicts the specific genetic features for PGC and DGC, which may generate differences in tumor malignancy. Our findings provide promising genetic targets for future specific and individualized gastric cancer therapy. EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is characterized by high frequency of DNA methylation. In this study, we investigated how epigenetic alteration of host genome contributes to pathogenesis of EBVaGC through the analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets from NIH TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) consortium. We identified that immune related genes (IRGs) is a group of host genes preferentially silenced in EBV-positive gastric cancers through DNA hypermethylation. Further functional characterizations of selected IRGs reveal their novel antiviral activity against not only EBV but also KSHV. In particular, we showed that metallothionein-1 (MT1) and homeobox A (HOXA) gene clusters are down-regulated via EBV-driven DNA hypermethylation. Several MT1 isoforms suppress EBV lytic replication and release of progeny virions as well as KSHV lytic reactivation, suggesting functional redundancy of these genes. In addition, single HOXA10 isoform exerts antiviral activity against both EBV and KSHV. We also confirmed the antiviral effect of other dysregulated IRGs, such as IRAK2 and MAL, in scenario of EBV and KSHV lytic reactivation. Collectively, our results demonstrated that epigenetic silencing of IRGs is a viral strategy to escape immune surveillance and promote viral propagation, which is overall beneficial to viral oncogenesis of human gamma-herpesviruses (EBV and KSHV), considering that these IRGs possess antiviral activities against these oncoviruses. Mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLE, a DNA polymerase associated with DNA replication and repair, lead to cancers with ultra-high mutation rates. Most studies focus on intestinal and uterine cancers with POLE mutations. These cancers exhibit a significant immune cell infiltrate and favorable prognosis. We questioned whether loss of function of other DNA polymerases can cooperate to POLE to generate the ultramutator phenotype.\\nWe used cases and data from 15 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas to investigate mutation frequencies of 14 different DNA polymerases. We tested whether tumor mutation burden, patient outcome (disease-free survival) and immune cell infiltration measured by ESTIMATE can be attributed to mutations in POLQ and POLZ/REV3L.\\nThirty six percent of colorectal, stomach and endometrial cancers with POLE mutations carried additional mutations in POLQ (E/Q), POLZ/REV3L (E/Z) or both DNA polymerases (E/Z/Q). The mutation burden in these tumors was significantly greater compared to POLE-only (E) mutant tumors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In addition, E/Q, E/Z, and E/Q/Z mutant tumors possessed an increased frequency of mutations in the POLE exonuclease domain (p\\u2009=\\u20090.013). Colorectal, stomach and endometrial E/Q, E/Z, and E/Q/Z mutant tumors within TCGA demonstrated 100% disease-free survival, even if the POLE mutations occurred outside the exonuclease domain (p\\u2009=\\u20090.003). However, immune scores in these tumors were related to microsatellite instability (MSI) and not POLE mutation status. This suggests that the host immune response may not be the sole mechanism for prolonged disease-free survival of ultramutated tumors in this cohort.\\nResults in this study demonstrate that mutations in POLQ and REV3L in POLE mutant tumors should undergo further investigation to determine whether POLQ and REV3L mutations contribute to the ultramutator phenotype and favorable outcome of patients with POLE mutant tumors. This study attempts to establish a Bayesian networks (BNs) based model for inferring the risk of AKI in gastrointestinal cancer (GI) patients, and to compare its predictive capacity with other machine learning (ML) models.\\nFrom 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, we recruited 6495 inpatients with GI cancers in a tertiary hospital in eastern China. Data on demographics, clinical and laboratory indicators were retrospectively extracted from the electronic medical record system. Predictors of AKI were selected in gLASSO regression, and further incorporated into BNs analysis.\\nThe incidences of AKI in patients with esophagus, stomach, and intestine cancer were 20.5%, 13.9%, and 12.5%, respectively. Through gLASSO, 11 predictors were screened out, including diabetes, cancer category, anti-tumor treatment, ALT, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum uric acid (SUA), hypoalbuminemia, anemia, abnormal sodium, and potassium. BNs model revealed that cancer category, treatment, eGFR, and hypoalbuminemia had direct connections with AKI. Diabetes and SUA were indirectly linked to AKI through eGFR, and anemia created connections with AKI through affecting album level. Compared with other ML models, BNs model maintained a higher AUC value in both the internal and external validation (AUC: 0.823/0.790).\\nBNs model not only delineates the qualitative and quantitative relationship between AKI and its associated factors but shows the more robust generalizability in AKI prediction. Sesquiterpenes belong to the largest group of plant secondary metabolites, which consist of three isoprene building units. These compounds are widely distributed in various angiosperms, a few gymnosperms and bryophytes. Sesquiterpenes and their allied derivatives are bio-synthesized in various plant parts including leaves, fruits and roots. These plant-based metabolites are predominantly identified in the Asteraceae family, wherein up to 5000 complexes have been documented to date. Sesquiterpenes and their derivatives are characteristically associated with plant defence mechanisms owing to their antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral activities. Over the last two decades, these compounds have been reportedly demonstrated health promoting perspectives against a wide range of metabolic syndromes i.e. hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular complications, neural disorders, diabetes, and cancer. The high potential of sesquiterpenes and their derivatives against various cancers like breast, colon, bladder, pancreatic, prostate, cervical, brain, liver, blood, ovarium, bone, endometrial, oral, lung, eye, stomach and kidney are the object of this review. Predominantly, it recapitulates the literature elucidating sesquiterpenes and their derivatives while highlighting the mechanistic approaches associated with their potent anticancer activities such as modulating nuclear factor kappa (NF-kB) activity, inhibitory action against lipid peroxidation and retarding the production of reactive oxygen & nitrogen species (ROS&RNS). Gastric cancer develops from chronic gastritis through distinct precancerous lesions which include atrophic gastritis (AG), intestinal metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia in a sequential manner, all of which are related to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. We determined the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the gastric premalignant conditions in a Southwestern Nigerian population with chronic gastritis.\\nA prospective cross-sectional study conducted on 252 adult patients with dyspepsia at a faith-based tertiary health facility in Nigeria. Gastroscopy was performed on all the participants and five gastric biopsies were taken from each of them. Standard histological examination for H. pylori, gastritis and the precancerous lesions was performed on the specimens. The biopsy sampling and histological examination were performed in line with the Updated Sydney System recommendations. We summarized data by Means ± Standard Deviation, frequencies and percentages. Associations between categorical variables were tested by means of Chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. The cutoff for statistical significance was P-value < 0.05.\\nA total of 78 (31.0%) subjects tested positive by histology for H. pylori infection. Of all the gastric precancerous lesions, AG had the highest prevalence [54 (21.4%)], followed by dysplasia [6 (2.4%)] and IM [3 (1.2%)]. Regarding the severity of the precancerous lesions, 47 (87.0%) subjects had mild AG while 7 (13.0%) had moderate AG. All the subjects with IM and dysplasia had mild or low-grade lesions.\\nThe prevalence rates of gastric precancerous lesions in our study population were low. Gastrointestinal diseases account for significant morbidity and mortality across the world. The study aims at establishing the epidemiological profile of gastrointestinal diseases in a Nigerian tertiary care center.\\nThis is a descriptive retrospective study of all gastrointestinal specimens, submitted to the histopathology department of Delta State University Teaching Hospital (DELSUTH) for diagnosis. The age, sex, and histological diagnosis were extracted from the archives of the department. These were re-reclassified into diagnostic groups, analyzed using Excel spread sheet 2007 and summarized in tables.\\nThe study involves 570 patients (290 males and 280 females) with gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases within the age range of 10 days to 99 years, and of a mean age of 48.4 years. Congenital, inflammatory, benign neoplasms, malignant neoplasms and vascular diseases accounted for 1.6%, 77.5%, 2.6%, 18.1% and 0.18% of the cases respectively. These lesions were domiciled in the esophagus (1.4%), stomach (53.3%), small intestine (7.9%), appendix (10%), colorectum (25.4%) and anus (2%). The peak incidence corresponded to the 5th decade with 72.5% of cases affecting patients of 30-69 years. Malignant lesions were found in the esophagus (5.8%), stomach (14.6%), small intestine (4.9%), colorectum (72.8%) and anus (1.9%) and were mostly adenocarcinomas.\\nThe study showed that GIT lesions were slightly more common among males. Majority of cases were inflammatory diseases (gastritis, appendicitis) with GIT cancers (colorectal and gastric cancer) being the next most common. The preponderance of GIT lesions among the productive age calls for action to ameliorate the trend. Preventive public enlightenment campaign on GIT cancer risk factors and population-based screening programmes especially for Helicobacter pylori infection and colorectal cancer is highly recommended. Guidelines propose different extents of macroscopic proximal margin for gastric cancer and frozen margin investigation in selected cases, but data is lacking. This study was to evaluate the necessary extent of macroscopic proximal margin, accuracy of frozen margin investigation, and prognostic impact of tumor-free proximal margin length in pT2-pT4 gastric cancer.\\nProximal and distal frozen margins were routinely investigated intraoperatively in all pT2-pT4 gastric cancers resected between 2011 and 2017. Macroscopic and microscopic proximal margin lengths were correlated. For R0-resections, survival analysis was performed for distal gastrectomy (DG) with microscopic proximal margin length ≤3\\u200acm versus >3\\u200acm.\\nOverall, 1484 patients were included. Microscopic proximal margin lengths were macroscopically more often misestimated in diffuse histology (P = 0.0004), but extent of underestimation in centimeter was similar to intestinal and mixed/undetermined type (P = 0.134). Fifteen cases (1.0%) resulted in R1-resection, 10 at distal, and 5 at proximal margin but none with macroscopic proximal margin ≥3\\u200acm and negative frozen section. Overall agreement of frozen margin and final pathology was 2951/2968 (99.4%). Proximal margin length in DG did not correlate with survival or recurrence in R0-resected patients.\\nDiffuse histology is at higher risk for underestimation of proximal margin length, but extent of underestimation is similar in other Laurén subtypes. If ≥3\\u200acm macroscopic proximal margin length is applied with intraoperative frozen margin confirmation, R1-resection can be avoided.\\nIn pT2-T4a gastric cancer, proximal margin of ≥3\\u200acm plus frozen margin confirmation provides high oncological safety. In DG patients with R0-resection, proximal margin length does not correlate with survival or recurrence. Cisplatin is a widely used anticancer drug that has adverse effects on gastrointestinal function. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of turmeric that has a wide range of biological activities. The present study investigated the effects of cisplatin on gastric emptying in mice and examined whether these can be inhibited by curcumin. We found that pretreatment with curcumin (200\\u2009mg/kg/day) for 10-30 days partly inhibited the decreases in gastric emptying rate and body weight induced by cisplatin. Furthermore, cisplatin reduced acetylcholine (ACh) concentration and the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of ACh receptor (AChR) as well as acetylcholinesterase activity in the stomach of mice; caused ultrastructural damage to interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC); and altered the expression of c-kit/stem cell factor and the gap junction protein connexin 43 in ICC. Curcumin pretreatment inhibited the effects of cisplatin on ACh indicators and ICC. These results demonstrate that curcumin can protect against cisplatin-induced gastric emptying disorder and thus has therapeutic potential for alleviating this condition in cancer patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy. Anastomotic leakage is a serious, sometimes critical complication of upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. The cavity and target drainage tubes are difficult to reach; therefore, a nasogastric tube (NGT) and fasting are required for an extended period. We successfully treated and managed two patients with anastomotic leakage using percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG).\\nIn case 1, a 79-year-old man with gastric cancer underwent total gastrectomy; 1\\u2009week later, he underwent emergent open laparotomy due to panperitonitis attributed to anastomotic leakage-related jejunojejunostomy. We resected the portion between esophagojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy and reconstructed it using the Roux-en-Y technique. On postoperative day (POD) 9, anastomotic leakage was diagnosed at the esophagojejunostomy site and jejunotomy staple line. After using a circular stapler for jejunojejunostomy, a stapled jejunal closure was added. We inserted an NGT and performed aspiration for bowel decompression. As he did not improve within 2\\u2009weeks, we decided to perform PTEG to free him of the NGT. We kept performing intermittent aspiration; leakage stopped shortly after, due to effective inner drainage. The PTEG catheter was removed after oral intake was restarted. In case 2, an 81-year-old man with esophagogastric junction cancer underwent resection of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. After shaping the remnant stomach, esophagogastrostomy was performed under the right thoracotomy. On POD 11, anastomotic leakage was identified, along with a mediastinal abscess. We inserted an NGT into the abscess cavity through the anastomotic leakage site. On POD 25, we performed PTEG and inserted a drainage tube, instead of an NGT. Although the abscess cavity disappeared, anastomotic leakage persisted as a fistula. We exchanged the PTEG with a double elementary diet (W-ED) tube with jejunal extension, with the side hole located near the anastomosis. The anastomotic fistula disappeared after treatment. Dysphagia persisted due to disuse atrophy of swallowing musculature; PTEG was useful for enteral feeding, even after the leakage occurred.\\nPatients are sometimes forced to endure pain for a long time for transnasal inner drainage. Using PTEG, patients will be free of sinus pain and discomfort; PTEG should be helpful for patients withstanding NGT. This study investigated the long-term clinical outcomes of endoscopic resection (ER) for undifferentiated-type (UD) early gastric cancer (EGC), with tumor size\\u2009>\\u20092\\xa0cm as the only non-curative factor.\\nFrom among 1123 patients who underwent ER for UD EGC at 18 tertiary hospitals in Korea between 2005 and 2014, we identified 216 patients with UD intramucosal EGC\\u2009>\\u20092\\xa0cm, which was completely resected, with negative resection margins, and absence of ulceration and lymphovascular invasion. The patients were divided into the additional surgery (n\\u2009=\\u200940) or observation (n\\u2009=\\u2009176) groups, according to post-ER management and were followed up for a median duration of 59\\xa0months for recurrence and 90\\xa0months for overall survival.\\nLymph node (LN) or distant metastasis or cancer-related mortality was not observed in the surgery group. In the observation group, two (1.1%) patients developed LN or distant metastasis with a 5-year cumulative risk of 0.7%, and one (0.6%) patient died of gastric cancer. The 5-\\xa0and 8-year overall survival rates were 94.1% and 89.9%, respectively, in the observation group and 100.0% and 95.2%, respectively, in the surgery group (log-rank P\\u2009=\\u20090.159). Cox regression analysis did not reveal an association between the observation group and increased mortality.\\nThe risk of LN or distant metastasis was not negligible, but as low as 1% for patients undergoing non-curative ER for UD EGC, with tumor size\\u2009>\\u20092\\xa0cm as the only non-curative factor. Close observation may be an alternative to surgery, especially for older patients or those with poor physical status. A therapeutic strategy involving combined treatment with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (LEP) has demonstrated a relatively high antitumor response in several solid tumors; however, the efficacy and safety of LEP in patients with refractory bile tract carcinoma (BTC) remains unknown.\\nThis is a single-arm study for a preliminary assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of LEP in patients who experienced progression from prior systemic treatments. Pre-treatment tumor tissues were collected to retrospectively evaluate the expression status of PDL1.\\nThirty-two patients received second-line and above treatment with LEP. Overall, the objective response rate (ORR) was 25%, the disease control rate (DCR) was 78.1%, and the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 40.5%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.9 months (95% CI: 4.7-5.2 months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.6-12.3 months). For tolerability, no grade 5 serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. All patients had any-grade AEs, and 59.3% of the patients experienced grade 3 AEs, while only 1 patient experienced a grade 4 AE of stomach bleeding. Fatigue was the most common AE, followed by hypertension and elevated aminotransferase levels. Retrospective analysis for PDL1 expression revealed that PDL1 positive tumor cells were associated with improved clinical benefits and survival outcomes.\\nLEP is a promising alternative as a non-first-line therapeutic regimen for patients with refractory BTC. Furthermore, well-designed prospective clinical trials with a control arm are still needed to obtain more evidences to confirm the efficacy and safety of this particular regimen as well as the role of PDL1 expression. This study aimed to investigate the potential risk factors for postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients with gastric cancer (GC) after radical gastrectomy.\\nIn total, 221 elderly patients with GC who were scheduled to undergo selective radical gastrectomy in our hospital were enrolled in this study. To define early POCD, the neuropsychological assessment was carried out 1\\u2009day before surgery and 7\\u2009days after surgery. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was carried out to evaluate the predicative and cut-off values of risk factors, including neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for early POCD. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate risk factors for early POCD.\\nOf the 221 enrolled elderly patients with GC, 42 were identified as early POCD with an incidence of 19.0% (42 of 221). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that NLR was a significant predictor for POCD with a cut-off value of 2.50 and an area under the curve of 0.711 (95% confidence interval: 0.624-0.798, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Preoperative NLR (≥2.50) was the only independent risk factor associated with POCD (odds ratio: 2.44, 95% confidence interval: 1.52-3.68, P = 0.013) by the multivariate logistic regression analysis.\\nPreoperative NLR level was an independent risk factor for POCD in elderly patients with GC undergoing curative resection. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 927-931.  A 66-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer(L, Less, Type 2, T4a[SE], N2, M1[LYM], H0, P0, cStage Ⅳ)and received treatment with S-1/cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy. This treatment resulted in partial response(PR) after 3 months, with reduction in the sizes of metastatic lymph nodes surrounding the pancreatic head and paraaortic lesion. However, the sizes of metastatic lymph nodes increased after 7 months of chemotherapy. Ramucirumab/nab-paclitaxel was then administered as second-line chemotherapy, and the diameter of the metastatic lymph nodes subsequently decreased after 4 months of the regimen. However, progressive disease was observed at 7 months, and blood transfusion was required because of bleeding from the primary gastric tumor. Therefore, nivolumab was initiated as third-line chemotherapy 14 months after the first treatment. After nivolumab administration, a 28% reduction in metastatic lymph nodes was achieved within 3 months, together with the regression of the primary gastric tumor and improvement in anemia within 6 months. PR was achieved after 12 months of nivolumab administration, and effective disease control was maintained for 16 months without any adverse reaction to nivolumab. A 32-year-old woman was admitted our hospital due to epigastric discomfort. The patient diagnosed as having scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach by upper gastrointestinal scope. Peritoneal dissemination and ovarian metastasis were confirmed by the diagnostic laparoscopy. Therefore, combination chemotherapy with S-1 and intraperitoneal chemotherapy(ip)with docetaxel (DTX) was started. After 2 courses chemotherapy, laparoscopy was performed again. Peritoneal dissemination was scarred, but biopsy showed altered AE1/AE3 positive cells, and increased left ovarian metastasis, so systemic chemotherapy was changed to DCS chemotherapy and added DTX ip. After 4 courses chemotherapy and 7 months after the first diagnosis, subtotal gastrectomy, hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy were performed because the cytology and tumor marker remained within normal range. In histopathological diagnosis, the effect of chemotherapy was Grade 2 at the primary site and Grade 3 at the metastatic site. Nine years have passed since the initial diagnosis and she has no relapse with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. A 53-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of upper abdominal pain and expansion of the pancreatic main duct. Enhanced computed tomography revealed expansion of the main pancreatic duct from the head to the tail; in addition, a 30 mm cystic tumor was observed in the pancreatic head and a 56 mm tumor was observed in the ventral side of the pancreatic body. Endoscopy revealed fistula formation in the duodenum of the Vater papilla on the oral side. The patient was diagnosed with an intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma(IPMC). In addition, PET-CT revealed accumulation of FDG in the ventral side of the pancreatic body, and a disseminated nodule in the omental bursa was suspected. We administered 6 courses of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel therapy, after which, the tumor in the ventral side of the pancreatic body disappeared. We then performed sub-stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The results of abdominal cavity washing cytology were negative, and there were no disseminated nodules in the omental bursa. Therefore, we could perform R0 excision. A 67-year-old man diagnosed with clinical Stage Ⅳ gastric cancer was administered nivolumab as fourth-line chemotherapy. After 9 courses, he was emergently admitted with complaints of low blood pressure and general malaise. On the fourth hospital day, he had high-grade fever and elevated serum C-reactive protein. Computed tomography showed a moderate amount of pericardial effusion. He was administered 1.7 mg/kg of methylprednisolone and improved rapidly. A hormonal blood examination showed his adrenal gland disorder. This is the first case in our country of pericardial effusion as an immune-reactive adverse event, which is not well known in Japan. Standard regimens for extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas(EPNEC)are not established. Treatment used for small cell lung cancer is also used for EPNECs. Amrubicin(AMR) monotherapy is used as salvage therapy for small cell lung cancer, but its efficacy in EPNEC is not clear. The aim of this study was to estimate the efficacy of AMR monotherapy in EPNEC. We retrospectively investigated patients with EPNEC who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy between April 2007 and March 2019. The time to treatment failure(TTF)and the efficacy and toxicity was analyzed in the patients who received AMR monotherapy. Among 43 patients with EPNEC, 14(13 males, one female; median age, 58 years)received AMR monotherapy. Primary site included the pancreas(n=3), stomach(n=3), rectum(n=1), anal canal(n=1), salivary glands(n= 1), urothelial(n=1), bladder(n=1), prostate(n=1), and 2 patients had primary unknown cancer. Pathological type included small cell(n=4), large cell(n=2), and other types(n=8). Prior chemotherapy comprised CDDP plus CPT-11(n =5), CDDP plus ETP(n=2), and CBDCA plus ETP(n=6). The median TTF was 49(20-61)days. One patient had a partial response and the disease control rate was 33%. The common adverse events of >Grade 3 were leukopenia(69%), neutropenia(62%), and febrile neutropenia(23%). AMR monotherapy was clinically effective and safe for EPNEC. It is well known that tumours arising in different organs are innervated and that \\'perineural invasion\\' (cancer cells escaping from the tumour by following the nerve trunk) is a negative prognostic factor. More surprisingly, increasing evidence suggests that the nerves can provide active inputs to tumours and there is two-way communication between nerves and cancer cells within the tumour microenvironment. Cells of the immune system also interact with the nerves and cancer cells. Thus, the nerve connections can exert significant control over cancer progression and modulating these (physically or chemically) can affect significantly the cancer process. Nerve inputs to tumours are derived mainly from the sympathetic (adrenergic) and the parasympathetic (cholinergic) systems, which are interactive. An important component of the latter is the vagus nerve, the largest of the cranial nerves. Here, we present a two-part review of the nerve inputs to tumours and their effects on tumorigenesis. First, we review briefly some relevant general issues including ultrastructural aspects, stemness, interactions between neurones and primary tumours, and communication between neurones and metastasizing tumour cells. Ultrastructural characteristics include synaptic vesicles, tumour microtubes and gap junctions enabling formation of cellular networks. Second, we evaluate the pathophysiology of the nerve input to five major carcinomas: cancers of prostate, stomach, colon, lung and pancreas. For each cancer, we present (i) the nerve inputs normally present in the cancer organ and (ii) how these interact and influence the cancer process. The best clinical evidence for the role of nerves in promoting tumorigenesis comes from prostate cancer patients where metastatic progression has been shown to be suppressed significantly in cases of spinal cord injury. The balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic contributions to early versus late tumorigenesis varies amongst the different cancers. Different branches of the vagus provide functional inputs to several of the carcinomas and, in two-way interaction with the sympathetic nervous system, affect different stages of the cancer process. Overall, the impact of the vagus nerve can be \\'direct\\' or \\'indirect\\'. Directly, the effect of the vagus is primarily to promote tumorigenesis and this is mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms. Indirectly, pro- and anti-tumour effects can occur by stimulation or inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system, respectively. Less well understood are the \\'indirect\\' anti-tumour effect of the vagus nerve via immunomodulation/inflammation, and the role of sensory innervation. A frequent occurrence in the nerve-tumour interactions is the presence of positive feedback driven by agents like nerve growth factor. We conclude that the nerve inputs to tumours can actively and dynamically impact upon cancer progression and are open to clinical exploitation. Anisakiasis or anisakiosis is a human parasitic infection caused by the third-stage larvae (L3) of nematodes of the genus Anisakis, although the term is also used in medical literature for the much less frequent (<3% of cases) infection by L3 of other genera of anisakids, particularly Pseudoterranova. These parasites have a marine lifecycle. Humans are infected by the L3 through ingesting of fish and squid, the intermediate/paratenic hosts. The live larvae generally penetrate the wall of the stomach or intestine causing, among other symptoms, intense pain or allergic symptoms. These are emerging, cosmopolite illnesses. Diagnosis and treatment is usually by endoscopy and extraction and identification of the larvae. Allergic forms are usually diagnosed by prick-test and/or allergen-specific IgE detection and treated with a suitable anti-allergy treatment. The patient is also warned against further consumption of marine fish or squid, as these may be infected with Anisakis. The most common method of prevention is thermal treatment of the entire fish or squid prior to consumption (>60\\xa0°C, >1\\xa0min or\\xa0-\\xa020\\xa0°C, >24\\xa0h). Useful measures for the control of anisakiasis would be to establish a national register of cases, to initiate educational campaigns for the general public and consciousness-raising and training campaigns for health professionals. These would be complemented by control measures for the relevant sectors of the economy: fish operators, fish farming, fishermen, fishmongers, fish industry and catering facilities. Possible genetic predisposition for allergy to Anisakis and the possible relationship between anisakiasis and cancer would also require further investigation. None Reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) may be limited to a dermatome or involve multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract. Although gastrointestinal manifestations of disseminated zoster have been likened to those of herpes simplex virus (HSV), histologic features of VZV-related injury to the tubular gut are not well-documented. We performed this study to describe the clinicopathologic features of VZV-related gastrointestinal injury. We identified 6 such patients with VZV infection. All involved the upper gastrointestinal tract, affecting the esophagus (n=3), stomach (n=2), or both (n=1). All patients were immunocompromised adults with hematologic malignancies (n=5) or a heart transplant (n=1); 3 with hematologic malignancies had received stem cell transplants. Five patients had cutaneous and gastrointestinal zoster; 1 had gastrointestinal disease alone. When compared with 14 HSV-related esophagitis controls, there were several notable differences. VZV caused hemorrhagic ulcers with nodularity or erythema, whereas HSV produced round, shallow ulcers on a background of nearly normal mucosa (P=0.01). VZV-related ulcers featured fibrin-rich, pauci-inflammatory exudates compared with the macrophage-rich exudates of HSV (P=0.003). The cytopathic changes of VZV were present at all levels of the squamous epithelium, especially in a peripapillary distribution. In contrast, HSV inclusions were located in the superficial layers (P=0.003) and detached keratinocytes. Unlike HSV, VZV involved the stomach, producing hemorrhage accompanied by striking apoptosis in the deep glands. We conclude that VZV produces unique patterns of gastrointestinal injury that facilitate its diagnosis. Recognition of gastrointestinal VZV infection is important because it heralds potentially life-threatening disseminated disease. The real-world data on adjuvant imatinib therapy in high-risk primary GIST are scarce.\\nWe have analysed the data of 107 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after resection treated with adjuvant imatinib (for planned 3 years with initial dose 400\\xa0mg daily, started not later than 4 months after operation) in 6 oncological centres in 2013-2018. All patients were required to have high risk of recurrence (at least 50% according to NCCN/AFIP criteria), known mutational status to exclude PDGFRA D842V mutants and KIT/PDGFRA-wild type cases from therapy without any further selection. Median follow-up time was 27 months.\\nThe most common primary localization of GIST was small bowel (63 patients; 59%), followed by the stomach (40 patients; 37%). The majority of GIST cases harboured exon 11 KIT mutations (88 cases, 82%), 11 cases had exon 9 KIT mutations (10%), 8 had other KIT/PDGFRA mutations potentially sensitive to imatinib. Forty patients (37%) finished 3-year adjuvant imatinib therapy as planned, 48 (45%) still continue therapy, 5 (4.5%) patients had finished adjuvant therapy prematurely due to toxicity, 6 (6%) due to disease progression on treatment and 8 (7.5%) due to other reasons. The disease relapse was detected in 19 patients, of them in 5 cases in exon 9 KIT mutants (45%), and 14 cases in patients with exon 11 KIT mutations (11%) [p\\xa0<\\xa00.01]. Estimated 4-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate is 78%.\\nThe early results of adjuvant therapy with imatinib in routine practice outside clinical trials in high-risk mutation-driven GIST patients only confirm high efficacy of this therapy with better tolerability than in clinical trials. We found overrepresentation of exon 9 KIT mutants and ruptured tumors in a group of patients with disease relapse. Gastric cancer (GC) incidence is currently decreasing; however, survival is still low. Early GC (EGC) has better prognosis and it could be cured by endoscopic methods.\\nObservational study of a retrospective cohort of all patients with GC during a five-year period in a health area of Spain. EGC diagnosis was defined as mucosal or submucosal (T1) cancers regardless of lymph node involvement, whereas the advanced GC were T2-T4.\\n209 patients were included, and 26 (12%) of them were EGC. There was no difference between EGC and advanced GC in age, sex, HP infection, precancerous lesions or histological type. Other characteristics of EGC were different from advanced GC: location (antrum and incisura in 76% vs 38%, p=0.01), alarm symptoms (69% vs 90%, p<0.01), curative treatment (100% vs 30%, p<0.01), performance status (PS 0-1: 92% vs 75%, p=0.03) and survival (85% vs 20%, p<0.001). Among patients who received curative treatment, 98% (79/81) underwent surgery and 2% (2/81) were treated by mucosectomy. Seven (27%) patients with EGC could have benefited from treatment by endoscopic submucosal resection.\\nEGC frequency was low (12% of GCs) in our health area. EGC had a high percentage of alarm symptoms, and was located in the distal third of the stomach (antrum and incisura) and had better prognosis compared to advanced GC. Strategies to increase detection and endoscopic treatment of EGC should be implemented. Signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRC) in advanced gastric cancer (GC) is often associated with more invasiveness and a worse prognosis than other cell types. The genetic alterations associated with gastric carcinogenesis in SRC are still unclear. In this study, 441 GC patients receiving curative surgery for GC between 2005 and 2013 were enrolled. The clinicopathological characteristics and genetic alterations of GC patients with and without SRC were compared. Among the 441 GC patients, 181 had SRC. For early GC, patients with SRC had more tumors located in the middle and lower stomach, more infiltrating tumors and better overall survival (OS) rates than those without SRC. For advanced GC, patients with SRC had more scirrhous type tumors, more  Chronic inflammation caused by  Based on clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer, high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a genetic test to select patients for immunotherapy targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4 without limitation to cancer type. However, it is unclear whether the MSI-H would broadly alter the tumor microenvironment to confer the therapeutic response of different cancer types to immunotherapy. To fill in this gap, we performed an in silico analysis of tumor immunity among different MSI statuses in five cancer types. We found that consistent with clinical responses to immunotherapy, MSI-H and non-MSI-H samples from colorectal cancer (COAD-READ) exhibited distinct infiltration levels and immune phenotypes. Surprisingly, the immunological difference between MSI-H and non-MSI-H samples was diminished in stomach adenocarcinoma and esophageal carcinoma (STAD-ESCA) and completely disappeared in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Regardless of cancer types, the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, rather than MSI status, strongly associated with the clinical outcome. Since preexisting antitumor immune response in the tumor (hot cancer) is accepted as a prerequisite to the therapeutic response to anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy, our data demonstrate that the impact of MSI varied on immune contexture will lead to the further evaluation of predictive immunotherapy responsiveness based on the universal biomarker of MSI status. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic body and tail is associated with a dismal prognosis. As patients frequently present themselves with locally advanced tumors, extended surgery including multivisceral resection is often necessary in order to achieve tumor-free resection margins. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality and to evaluate the influence of multivisceral resections on patient outcome.\\nThis is a retrospective analysis of 94 patients undergoing resection of adenocarcinoma located in the pancreatic body and/or tail between April 1995 and December 2016 at our institution. Uni- and multivariable Cox regression analysis was conducted to identify independent prognostic factors for postoperative survival.\\nMultivisceral resections, including partial resections of the liver, the large and small intestines, the stomach, the left kidney and adrenal gland, and major vessels, were carried out in 47 patients (50.0%). The median postoperative follow-up time was 12.90 (0.16-220.92) months. Median Kaplan-Meier survival after resection was 12.78\\u2009months with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 53.2%, 15.8%, and 9.0%. Multivariable Cox regression identified coeliac trunk resection (p = 0.027), portal vein resection (p = 0.010), intraoperative blood transfusions (p = 0.005), and lymph node ratio in percentage (p = 0.001) as independent risk factors for survival. Although postoperative complications requiring surgical revision were observed more frequently after multivisceral resections (14.9 versus 2.1%; p = 0.029), postoperative survival was not significantly inferior when compared to patients undergoing standard distal or subtotal pancreatectomy (12.35 versus 13.87\\u2009months; p = 0.377).\\nOur data indicates that multivisceral resection in cases of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma of the body and/or tail is justified, as it is not associated with increased mortality and can even facilitate long-term survival, albeit with an increase in postoperative morbidity. Simultaneous resections of major vessels, however, should be considered carefully, as they are associated with inferior survival. As of today, cancer is still one of the most prevalent and high-mortality diseases, summing more than 9 million deaths in 2018. This has motivated researchers to study the application of machine learning-based solutions for cancer detection to accelerate its diagnosis and help its prevention. Among several approaches, one is to automatically classify tumor samples through their gene expression analysis.\\nIn this work, we aim to distinguish five different types of cancer through RNA-Seq datasets: thyroid, skin, stomach, breast, and lung. To do so, we have adopted a previously described methodology, with which we compare the performance of 3 different autoencoders (AEs) used as a deep neural network weight initialization technique. Our experiments consist in assessing two different approaches when training the classification model - fixing the weights after pre-training the AEs, or allowing fine-tuning of the entire network - and two different strategies for embedding the AEs into the classification network, namely by only importing the encoding layers, or by inserting the complete AE. We then study how varying the number of layers in the first strategy, the AEs latent vector dimension, and the imputation technique in the data preprocessing step impacts the network\\'s overall classification performance. Finally, with the goal of assessing how well does this pipeline generalize, we apply the same methodology to two additional datasets that include features extracted from images of malaria thin blood smears, and breast masses cell nuclei. We also discard the possibility of overfitting by using held-out test sets in the images datasets.\\nThe methodology attained good overall results for both RNA-Seq and image extracted data. We outperformed the established baseline for all the considered datasets, achieving an average F\\nWe observed that the approach of fine-tuning the weights of the top layers imported from the AE reached higher results, for all the presented experiences, and all the considered datasets. We outperformed all the previous reported results when comparing to the established baselines. Integrin αV, encoded by ITGAV gene is one of the most studied protein subunits, closely associated with liver, pancreatic and stomach cancer progression and metastasis via regulation of angiogenesis. Occurrence of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer-associated proteins is a key determinant for varied susceptibility of an individual towards cancer.\\nThe study investigated the deleterious effects of these cancer-associated SNPs on the protein\\'s structure, stability and cancer causing potential using an in silico approach. Numerous computational tools were employed that identified the most deleterious cancer-associated SNPs and those to get actively involved in post-translational modifications. Impact of these SNPs on the protein structure, function and stability was also examined. Conclusion and Future Scope: A total 63 non-synonymous SNPs in ITGAV gene were observed to be associated in these three gastrointestinal cancers and among this 63, 19 were the most deleterious ones. The structural and functional importance of residues altered by most damaging SNPs was analyzed through evolutionary conservation and solvent accessibility. The study also elucidated three-dimensional structures of the 19 most damaging mutants. The analysis of conformational variation identified 5SNPs (D379Y, G188E, G513V, L950P, and R540L) in integrin αV, which influence protein\\'s structure. Three calcium binding sites were predicted at residues: D379, G384 and G408 and a peptide binding site at residue: R369 in integrin αV. Therefore, SNPs D379Y, G384C, G408R and R369W have the potential to alter the binding properties of the protein. Screening and characterization of deleterious SNPs could advance novel biomarker discovery and therapeutic development in future. Surgery and chemoradiotherapy can potentially cure esophageal and gastric cancer patients, although they may impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We aim to systemically review and meta-analyze literature to determine the effect of curative treatments on HRQoL in esophageal and gastric cancer.- A systematic search was performed identifying studies assessing HRQoL. Meta-analyses were performed on baseline and subsequent time-points.- From the 6067 articles retrieved, 49 studies were included (61 % low quality). Meta-analyses showed short-term HRQoL differences between esophageal cancer patients receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT), neoadjuvant chemo(radio)therapy (nC(R)T), or surgery alone (p < 0.001), with better HRQoL with nC(R)T and surgery compared to dCRT. Over the course of 12 months, no HRQoL difference was identified between treatments in esophageal cancer (p = 0.633). Esophagectomy, but not gastrectomy, resulted in a clinically relevant decline in HRQoL. No long-term HRQoL differences were identified between curative treatments in esophageal and gastric cancer. More high-quality HRQoL studies are warranted. Few prospective cohort studies have investigated associations between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and other cancer sites, in addition to lung cancer. We assessed these associations in a population-based prospective cohort study started from 2008 to 2011 with average of 9.1 years of follow-up, in Minhang district, Shanghai, China. The study included a total of 23,415 participants (8388 men, 15,027 women) and 205,515 person-years. Epidemiological data were collected by a standardized questionnaire including ETS exposure. Newly diagnosed patients with primary cancers and deaths were identified by record linkage system with the Shanghai Cancer Registry and Shanghai Vital Statistics. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusting for potential confounders. During the study period, a total of 1462 patients with diagnoses of primary cancers were identified. Among all participants and non-smokers, ETS was associated with an increased risk of all smoking-related cancers (all: adjusted HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.05-1.43 and non-smokers: 1.24, 1.02-1.49), lung cancer (1.29, 0.98-1.71 and 1.27, 0.91-1.77), and stomach cancer (1.86, 1.21-2.85 and 1.75, 1.05-2.91), respectively. Furthermore, associations for lung and stomach cancers were the strongest among non-smoking females. The joint effects of both ETS and active smoking were strongest for all cancers, all smoking-related cancers, lung cancer, and stomach cancer. No clear interactions were observed. These results suggest that ETS exposure may increase the risk of smoking-related cancers in a Chinese population. Further studies on the relationship between ETS exposure and specific cancer sites are warranted to replicate our findings. Lung adenocarcinomas present as tight clusters and three-dimensional balls in effusion specimens. Unlike carcinomas of breast and stomach where singly lying malignant cells are seen in effusion samples, lung adenocarcinomas usually show cohesive morphology. This single-cell pattern may also be confused with reactive mesothelial cells. We studied the frequency of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with single-cell pattern cytomorphology in pleural effusion specimens.\\nAll cases reported as either suspicious or positive for malignancy on pleural effusion cytology (PFC) over the past 1 year were retrieved. The clinical details were obtained from requisition forms. Cases with predominant single-cell pattern, clinically suspicious of carcinoma lung were segregated. These were de-stained and immunocytochemistry (ICC) for TTF-1 was performed.\\nOf 103 cases reported as either suspicious or positive for malignancy on PFC, 29 had a predominant single-cell pattern. Of these, 13 (44.8%) were primary lung carcinoma. The rest were metastasis from ovary (5; 17.2%), breast (2; 6.9%), stomach (2; 6.9%), lymphoma (1; 3.5%), and Ewing\\'s sarcoma (1; 3.5%). Five (17.2%) were those with unknown primary. All cases of lung carcinoma were positive for TTF-1 ICC.\\nSingle-cell pattern of pulmonary adenocarcinoma is commoner than popularly believed. This pattern may be difficult to differentiate from carcinoma cells of other sites as well as from reactive mesothelial cells. A high degree of suspicion is therefore needed to perform relevant ICC to clinch the correct diagnosis. Neuroendocrine neoplasms are most often found in the small intestine, rectum, appendix, and stomach. The colon, excluding the appendix and the cecum, is a rare location for these neoplasms and often gives rise to highly proliferative, poorly differentiated tumors with aggressive features and dismal prognosis. A 32-year-old male presents with a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma arising from an unusual location, the descending colon. The patient\\'s clinical and imaging characteristics resembles those seen in the much more common neoplasm, colonic adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography and In-111 octreotide scan are limited in diagnosing large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Pathologic correlation of a surgical specimen is required to make the correct diagnosis. Although frameshift variants in the microsatellite area of shugoshin 1 (\\nIn a total of 55 cases, 30 gastric cancer resection and 25 non-resection cases, DNA was extracted from both tumour and normal parts and PCR was performed. The variant was confirmed by TA cloning, and MSI was evaluated using GeneMapper software.\\nA frameshift variant of c.973delA was observed in 16 of the 45 evaluable cases. Its frequency was 35.6%. Of the 25 cases that could be assessed for MSI status, two cases of MSI-H were associated with the c.973delA \\nOur study shows that  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the provision of medical care. Planning to ensure there is capability to treat those that become ill with the virus has led to an almost complete moratorium on elective work. This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 on cancer, in particular surgical intervention, in patients with esophago-gastric cancer at a high-volume tertiary center.\\nAll patients undergoing potential management for esophago-gastric cancer from 12 March to 22 May 2020 had their outcomes reviewed. Multi-disciplinary team (MDT) decisions, volume of cases, and outcomes following resection were evaluated.\\nOverall 191 patients were discussed by the MDT, with a 12% fall from the same period in 2019, including a fall in new referrals from 120 to 83 (P\\u2009=\\u20090.0322). The majority of patients (80%) had no deviation from the pre-COVID-19 pathway. Sixteen patients had reduced staging investigations, 4 had potential changes to their treatment only, and 10 had a deviation from both investigation and potential treatment. Only one patient had palliation rather than potentially curative treatment. Overall 19 patients underwent surgical resection. Eight patients (41%) developed complications with two (11%) graded Clavien-Dindo 3 or greater. Two patients developed COVID-19 within a month of surgery, one spending 4\\xa0weeks in critical care due to respiratory complications; both recovered. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic resections with no complications.\\nCare must be taken not to compromise cancer treatment and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excellent results can be achieved through meticulous logistical planning, good communication, and maintaining high-level clinical care. For many years, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy remained essential in the therapeutic management of gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. For these tumours, surgical excision, the only hope of offering the patient prolonged survival, is only possible in 20% of cases. The median survival of operated patients is only 12 to 20 months due to the frequency of locoregional and/or metastatic recurrences. For stomach cancers, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is justified by the results of the phase III trial Intergroup 0116 published by MacDonald et al. The gain in survival was at the cost of significant toxicity. This treatment was supplanted in the early 2000s by perioperative chemotherapy. Currently, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy clinical studies are ongoing with the aim of improving treatments observance and tolerance. For pancreatic cancers, the role of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy has long been discussed because of trials with contradictory results. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy has many advantages in terms of efficacy and tolerance. It increases the chances of subsequent complete tumour resection. Several prospective trials are currently ongoing to clarify its place in the therapeutic arsenal. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), comprising 1%-3% of gastric malignances, has been associated with  胃型极高分化型腺癌是一种罕见的胃腺癌，其特征是肿瘤腺体拥有良好黏液结构，细胞几乎没有核的异型性，与小凹上皮或幽门腺极为相似。胃型极高分化型腺癌分化程度好，由于尚无统一的病理诊断方法，术前活检病理诊断困难。本病例不仅术前重复活检两次，仍然未能明确诊断，而且病变呈黏膜下层肿瘤样，表面散在开口或呈蜂窝状改变，形态极为特殊，目前极少数文献报道。.    The optimal management of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) due to gastric cancer (GC) is unclear. We examined the relationships between clinical and management variables and outcomes in patients with GC having GOO.\\nThe GOO management and clinical course were reviewed in patients with GC and GOO. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to identify variables predictive of overall survival (OS).\\nThe study included 59 patients. Eleven had imaging evidence of metastasis and 35 had pathologically confirmed peritoneal disease. Initial management included resection in 23 patients, feeding jejunostomy\\u2009±\\u2009decompressive gastrostomy (JT/GT) in 25, surgical gastrojejunostomy in five, and endoscopic intervention in six. Seven patients with initial JT/GT underwent resection after neoadjuvant therapy. Median OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 21.4 (0.0-45.1) months in the upfront resection group (median follow-up, 14.7 months) and not reached in those with initial JT/GT, neoadjuvant therapy, and later resection (median follow-up, 26.5 months) (P\\u2009=\\u2009.18). On multivariable analysis, clinically positive nodes (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.76; 95% CI, 1.17-12.12; P\\u2009=\\u2009.03), metastasis on CT (HR: 3.97; 95% CI: 1.53-10.26;P\\u2009=\\u2009.01), and resection (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17-0.79;P\\u2009=\\u2009.01) independently predicted OS.\\nIn GOO due to GC, OS is similar after treatment with upfront resection compared with JT/GT, neoadjuvant therapy, and later resection. Upfront JT/GT may allow patients to tolerate chemotherapy and improve selection for gastrectomy. Many of the known prognostic gene signatures for cancer are individual genes or combination of genes, found by the analysis of microarray data. However, many random gene expression signatures are more predictive than known cancer signatures, and such predictive power of random signatures is largely attributed to cell proliferation genes. With the availability of RNA-seq gene expression data for thousands of human cancer patients, we have analyzed RNA-seq and clinical data of cancer patients and constructed gene correlation networks specific to individual cancer patients. From the gene correlation networks, we derived potential prognostic gene pairs for liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and stomach cancer. In this paper, we present a new approach to inferring prognostic signatures from patient-specific gene correlation networks. Evaluation of our approach with comprehensive data of liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and stomach cancer showed that our approach is general and that gene pairs found by our approach are more reliable prognostic signatures than genes. Our approach will be useful for constructing patient-specific gene correlation networks and for the prognosis of patients. The web server for dynamically constructing patient-specific gene networks and for finding prognostic gene pairs is accessible at http://bclab.inha.ac.kr/LPS. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), a cell surface-bound protease, is associated with various diseases including cancer. The detection of the enzyme activity is an important subject, leading to about 40 activatable fluorescent probes so far. All of them, however, lack the membrane-localizing ability, raising a reliability issue in the quantitative analysis. Disclosed is the first fluorescent probe that senses the cell surface-bound enzyme, which, furthermore, is capable of ratiometric as well as two-photon imaging with desirable features. Ratiometric imaging of cancer cell lines reveals a 6.4-8.4-fold higher GGT levels than those in normal cell lines. A comparison of the enzyme activity in organ tissues of normal and tumor xenograft mice reveals notably different levels of enzyme activity depending on the kind of tissue. Normal tissues exhibited comparable levels of enzyme activity, except the kidney that has significantly higher GGT activity (2.7-4.0-fold) than the other organs. Compared with the normal tissues, considerably higher enzyme activity was observed in the tumor tissues of the thigh (4.0-fold), colon (2.5-fold), lung (3.6-fold), and liver (2.1-fold), but essentially no enhanced activity in the tumor tissues of the spleen, stomach, and pancreas and a comparable level in both the tumor and normal kidney tissues were observed. The probe offers practical means for studying GGT-associated biology in cells and tissues by one- as well as two-photon ratiometric imaging. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. As a nexus for transducing metabolic signals, AMPK cooperates with other energy-sensing pathways to modulate cellular responses to metabolic stressors. With metabolic reprogramming being a hallmark of cancer, the utility of agents targeting AMPK has received continued scrutiny and results have demonstrated conflicting effects of AMPK activation in tumorigenesis. Harnessing multi-omics datasets from human tumors, we seek to evaluate the seemingly pleiotropic, tissue-specific dependencies of AMPK signaling dysregulation.\\nWe interrogated copy number variation and differential transcript expression of 92 AMPK pathway genes across 21 diverse cancers involving over 18,000 patients. Cox proportional hazards regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of AMPK dysregulation on patient outcomes.\\nA total of 24 and seven AMPK pathway genes were identified as having loss- or gain-of-function features. These genes exhibited tissue-type dependencies, where survival outcomes in glioma patients were most influenced by AMPK inactivation. Cox regression and log-rank tests revealed that the 24-AMPK-gene set could successfully stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups in glioma, sarcoma, breast and stomach cancers. The 24-AMPK-gene set could not only discriminate tumor from non-tumor samples, as confirmed by multidimensional scaling analyses, but is also independent of tumor, node and metastasis staging. AMPK inactivation is accompanied by the activation of multiple oncogenic pathways associated with cell adhesion, calcium signaling and extracellular matrix organization. Anomalous AMPK signaling converged on similar groups of transcriptional targets where a common set of transcription factors were identified to regulate these targets. We also demonstrated crosstalk between pro-catabolic AMPK signaling and two pro-anabolic pathways, mammalian target of rapamycin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, where they act synergistically to influence tumor progression significantly.\\nGenetic and transcriptional aberrations in AMPK signaling have tissue-dependent pro- or anti-tumor impacts. Pan-cancer investigations on molecular changes of this pathway could uncover novel therapeutic targets and support risk stratification of patients in prospective trials. Pathogenic AXIN2 variants cause absence of permanent teeth (hypodontia), sparse hair and eye brows (ectodermal dysplasia), and gastrointestinal polyps and cancer. Inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Only twenty- five patients have been reported from five families. A Mayo Clinic pilot program tested 3009 newly diagnosed cancer patients for pathogenic germline variants in 83 hereditary cancer genes, including AXIN2. We found only one patient with a pathogenic AXIN2 variant.\\nThe proband was a 49\\u2009year-old female who came to Otolaryngology clinic complaining of right-sided nasal obstruction. Biopsy of identified nasal polyp revealed olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma). Surgical resection with gross, total tumor resection was followed by radiation therapy. The patient enrolled in a clinical pilot of genetic testing and a pathogenic variant in AXIN2, c.1822del (p.Leu608Phefs*81) (NM_004655.3) was found. She was seen in Medical Genetics clinic and found to have a personal history of hypodontia. Her eyebrows, hair, and nails were all normal. She underwent upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. A four mm gastric adenoma was found and removed.\\nThis is the first case reported on a patient with a pathogenic, germline AXIN2 variant and an olfactory neuroblastoma or a gastric adenoma. We propose that these could be features of the AXIN2 phenotype. The known association between gastric adenomas and familial adenomatous polyposis, the other Wnt/beta-catenin disorder, supports the hypothesis that pathogenic AXIN2 variants increase risk as well. As the odds of a chance co-occurrence of a pathogenic AXIN2 variant and an olfactory neuroblastoma are so rare, it is worth exploring potential causation. We are building a clinical registry to expand understanding of the AXIN2 phenotype and request any clinicians caring for patients with pathogenic AXIN2 variants to contact us. Adenocarcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation (ACED) has high malignant potential. It is known as clear-cell adenocarcinoma, which is a special type of adenocarcinomas characterized by primitive intestine-like structures. Although ACED is often encountered in the stomach, it is very rare in the colon and has not been sufficiently reported. ACED has also not been described in the WHO and Japanese Colonic Carcinoma Classification. ACED has biological characteristics of easy metastasis and a poor prognosis than these of tubular adenocarcinoma. Therefore, all cases of colonic ACED that have been reported previously required either surgery or chemotherapy. We describe a case of flat-elevated-type and 15\\xa0mm in size colonic ACED that was successfully treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection. We report our case along with a relevant literature review. Gastric cancer (GC) is the most common malignancy of the stomach. This study was aimed at elucidating the regulatory network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA and identifying the precise inflammation-related targets in GC. The expression profiles of GSE83521, GSE78091, and GSE33651 were obtained from the GEO database. Interactions between miRNAs and circRNAs were investigated by the Circular RNA Interactome, and targets of miRNAs were predicted with miRTarBase. Then, a circRNA/miRNA/mRNA regulatory network was constructed. Also, functional enrichment analysis of selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed. The inflammation-/GC-related targets were collected in the GeneCards and GenLiP3 database, respectively. And a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DE mRNAs was constructed with STRING and Cytoscape to identify hub genes. The genetic alterations, neighboring gene networks, expression levels, and the poor prognosis of hub genes were investigated in cBioPortal, Oncomine, and Human Protein Atlas databases and Kaplan-Meier plotter, respectively. A total of 10 DE miRNAs and 33 DEGs were identified. The regulatory network contained 26 circRNAs, 10 miRNAs, and 1459 mRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the selected 33 DEGs were involved in negative regulation of fat cell differentiation, response to wounding, extracellular matrix- (ECM-) receptor interaction, and regulation of cell growth pathways. THBS1, FN1, CALM1, COL4A1, CTGF, and IGFBP5 were selected as inflammation-related hub genes of GC in the PPI network. The genetic alterations in these hub genes were related to amplification and missense mutations. Furthermore, the genes RYR2, ERBB2, PI3KCA, and HELZ2 were connected to hub genes in this study. The hub gene levels in clinical specimens were markedly upregulated in GC tissues and correlated with poor overall survival (OS). Our results suggest that THBS1, FN1, CALM1, COL4A1, CTGF, and IGFBP5 were associated with the pathogenesis of gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as biomarkers and inflammation-related targets for GC. China has a heavy cancer burden. We aimed to quantitatively estimate the secular trend of cancer mortality and incidence in China.\\nWe extracted numbers, age-specific and age-standardized rates of 29 cancer groups (from 1990 to 2017) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2017. We estimated rates of major cancer types for annual percent change by Joinpoint regression, and for age, period, and cohort effect by an age-period-cohort model.\\nIn 2017, breast cancer had the highest incidence rate in females. Lung cancer had the highest mortality and incidence rates in males. Although the age-standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer ranked second highest in males, it increased by 112% from 1990 to 2017. Individuals aged over 50 years were at high risk of developing cancer, and the number of deaths at this age accounted for over 89% of all cancers in all age groups. When compared with the global average level, the age-standardized mortality and incidence rates of both liver and esophageal cancers were 2.1 times higher in China, and stomach, lung and nasopharyngeal cancers in China also had high levels (more than 1.5 times higher). During 1990-2017, most of the 29 cancers exhibited an increasing incidence trend, and Joinpoint regression demonstrated increasing mortality of some major cancers. The period effect indicated that the risk of mortality and incidence due to the main cancers generally increased during 1992-2017.\\nTrend analysis provided information on the effects of prevention strategies and targeted interventions on the occurrence of different cancers. Etiological studies need to be conducted on some major cancers in the Chinese population. Stomach cancer is one of the highest incidence and mortality malignancies worldwide. Our study aimed to illustrate the somatic mutation landscape and identify molecular markers of stomach cancer.\\nBy integrated analysis of sequencing data and clinical data of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified several susceptibility genes and novel molecular markers and validated their potential function by the starBase website. Further, we validated the clinical value of two candidate lncRNAs in collected STAD samples by RT-qPCR.\\nWe illustrated the distributions of mutation frequencies and types to get the top 20 high-mutation frequency genes in STAD. We also found 2127 mRNAs, 129 miRNAs, and 170 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed. We identified four lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNAs (PVT1, MAGI2-AS3, MIR17HG, KCNQ1OT1). Besides, 27 mRNAs (PDE4C, ID1, AQP3, VCAN, FAP, NOX4, ANGPT2, SERPINE1, SPARC, PDGFRB, FN1, MFAP2, CSMD2, INHBA, COL10A1, MATN3, P4HA3, ADAMTS12, DGKI, OLFML2B, TMEM200A, FNDC1, CTHRC1, CHST1, F5, COL5A2, TUBB3) and two lncRNAs (MIR4458HG, LINC01235) showed a significant prognostic value, and their prognostic values were validated by the starBase website. What\\'s more, the clinical values of MIR4458HG and LINC01235 were also demonstrated in collected STAD samples.\\nWe constructed the lncRNA ceRNA networks and identified 20 high-mutation frequency genes and 29 prognostic markers (27 mRNAs and two lncRNAs). Gastric stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) presented from superficial gastritis to deep ulceration consequent to insufficient perfusion, ischemia, and oxidative stress. Though pharmacologic interventions to optimize tissue perfusion or to enhance defensive mechanism are essential, limited clinical outcome necessitates strong acid suppressors or natural agents. Under the hypothesis that  Machine learning has led to several endoscopic studies about the automated localization of digestive lesions and prediction of cancer invasion depth. Training and validation dataset collection are required for a disease in each digestive organ under a similar image capture condition; this is the first step in system development. This data cleansing task in data collection causes a great burden among experienced endoscopists. Thus, this study classified upper gastrointestinal (GI) organ images obtained via routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) into precise anatomical categories using AlexNet.\\nIn total, 85,246 raw upper GI endoscopic images from 441 patients with gastric cancer were collected retrospectively. The images were manually classified into 14 categories: 0) white-light (WL) stomach with indigo carmine (IC); 1) WL esophagus with iodine; 2) narrow-band (NB) esophagus; 3) NB stomach with IC; 4) NB stomach; 5) WL duodenum; 6) WL esophagus; 7) WL stomach; 8) NB oral-pharynx-larynx; 9) WL oral-pharynx-larynx; 10) WL scaling paper; 11) specimens; 12) WL muscle fibers during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD); and 13) others. AlexNet is a deep learning framework and was trained using 49,174 datasets and validated using 36,072 independent datasets.\\nThe accuracy rates of the training and validation dataset were 0.993 and 0.965, respectively.\\nA simple anatomical organ classifier using AlexNet was developed and found to be effective in data cleansing task for collection of EGD images. Moreover, it could be useful to both expert and non-expert endoscopists as well as engineers in retrospectively assessing upper GI images. Everolimus is recognized as one of the standard drugs for the treatment of unresectable or recurrent gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET). However, recent evidence has suggested that addition of somatostatin analogs to everolimus may yield better survival outcomes as compared to everolimus alone. In April 2020, we have initiated a randomized phase III trial in Japan, to confirm the superiority of combined everolimus plus lanreotide therapy over everolimus monotherapy in patients with unresectable or recurrent gastroenteropancreatic NETs with poor prognostic factors (Ki-67 labeling index: LI 5%-20% or Ki-67 LI\\xa0<\\xa05% with diffuse liver metastases). We plan to enroll a total of 250 patients from 76 institutions over an accrual period of 5 years. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. The key secondary endpoint is overall survival, with response rate, disease control rate, and proportion of patients with adverse events as the other secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials as jRCT1031200023 [https://jrct.niph.go.jp/en-latest-detail/jRCT1031200023]. Cancers are believed to originate from stem cells. Previously, the hypothesis was that tumors developed due to dedifferentiation of mature cells. We studied the regulation of gastric acid secretion and showed that gastrin through the gastrin receptor stimulates enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell histamine release and proliferation. In animal and human studies, we and others showed that long-term hypergastrinemia results in ECL cell-derived tumor through a sequence of hyperplasia, dysplasia, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and possibly neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and adenocarcinomas of diffuse type. Perhaps, other cancers may also have their origin in differentiated cells. Knowledge of the growth regulation of the cell of origin is important in cancer prophylaxis and treatment. Physiology plays a central role in carcinogenesis through hormones and other growth factors. Every cell division implies a small risk of mutation; thus mitogens are also mutagens. Moreover, metastasis of slow proliferating cells may also explain so-called tumor dormancy and late recurrence. The main evidence regarding social inequalities in cancer risk comes from industrialized countries. The aim of this manuscript was to analyze the association between cancer incidence and socioeconomic position (SEP) in a middle-income country (Costa Rica) between 2011 and 2015.\\nAn ecological study at the level of the electoral district was conducted. The 477 districts were divided by area and wealth using the 2011 Census. The sample was defined using the National Electoral Rolls used for presidential elections of 2006 and 2010 (N = 2 798 517). 44 799 cancer cases were included coming from the Costa Rican Cancer Registry. Cox models were used.\\nAll cancer sites combined, we observed a positive gradient, with incidence being lower in the poorest districts than in the wealthiest (HRQ2 = 0.98 [0.93-1.03], HRQ3 = 0.92 [0.85-0.99], HRQ4 = 0.83 [0.77-0.88]). For colon, skin, breast, prostate, thyroid and other cancer sites, a positive social gradient was observed. For stomach, lung, and cervical (invasive or in-situ) cancers, a negative social gradient was found. For uterine cancer and lymphoma (no-Hodgkin), there was no significant relationship between wealth and incidence. For skin cancer, incidence was higher in rural as compared to urban areas after adjustment for wealth. For lung, cervical and uterine cancer, incidence was lower in rural as compared to urban area after adjustment for wealth.\\nThe all-cancer combined results were in contradiction with the international literature but confirmed recent study results in Costa Rica. It confirmed the importance of studying socioeconomic inequalities in middle-income countries. Helicobacter pylori is accounted as the most etiologic agent for digestive disorders, in particular, the most important of them i.e. peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. In the recent years, association of vacA genotypes and gastrointestinal disorders has attracted a lot of attention. In present study, we assessed the correlation between vacA genotypes (s1, s2, m1, m2, s1m1, s1m2, s2m1 and s2m2) and development to peptic ulcer in Iranian population.\\nIn our study, first, 24 original articles containing of information of 3328 patients were evaluated. Statistical analysis was done by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2.0 software (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). In this regards, we used from fixed-effects model for analysis of data with low heterogeneity, while for analysis of data with high heterogeneity (I\\nAbundance of each of s1, s2, m1, m2, s1m1, s1m2, s2m1, and s2m2 was estimated 36.24, 28.32, 42.90 29.86, 27.88, 32.34, 15.70, and 25.94%, respectively. According to the results, the m1, s1, and s1m2 genotypes were among the most prevalent genotypes among the Iranian patients, whereas, s2m1 genotype had the lowest frequency.\\nOverall, 24 articles (total participants\\u2009=\\u20093328) were included in this comprehensive analysis. H. pylori infection rate were 90.26% in these cases, so that 33.65% of whom had peptic ulcer. Moreover, the abundance of each vacA genotypes including s1, s2, m1, m2, s1m1, s1m2, s2m1, and s2m2 was estimated as 36.24, 28.32, 42.90 29.86, 27.88, 32.34, 15.70, and 25.94% respectively. We demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between infection of stomach with m1, s1m1, and s2m1 genotypes and development to peptic ulcer disease. Stem cells or their closely related committed progenitor cells are the likely founder cells of most neoplasms. In the continually renewing and hierarchically organized epithelia of the oesophagus, stomach and intestine, homeostatic stem cells are located at the beginning of the cell flux, in the basal layer of the oesophagus, the isthmic region of gastric oxyntic glands and at the bottom of gastric pyloric-antral glands and colonic crypts. The introduction of mutant oncogenes such as Kras Although gastric cancer is one of the Lynch syndrome (LS)-related tumors, the clinicopathological features of gastric cancer in patients with LS remain uncertain. To investigate the incidence risk and clinicopathological features of gastric neoplasms in LS, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in Japanese LS patients.\\nLS patients with pathogenic mismatch repair (MMR) gene variants were extracted from the LS registry of the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan. Cumulative risks of gastric neoplasm, including dysplasia and cancer, were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Gastric atrophy was evaluated endoscopically and/or histologically. Immunohistochemical staining for MMR proteins was performed for all available specimens.\\nOf 118 eligible patients, 26 patients were diagnosed with 58 gastric neoplasms. The cumulative incidence of gastric neoplasm was 41.0% (95% confidence interval, 26.9-55.0) at the age of 70. Of these, 13 (50%) patients developed synchronous and/or metachronous multiple gastric neoplasms. Among the 49 gastric neoplasms available for detailed pathological evaluation, all were associated with intestinal metaplasia. Immunohistochemically, 42 (86%) were MMR-deficient. The individuals with gastric atrophy had a significantly higher risk of developing gastric neoplasms compared with those without gastric atrophy (26 cases/54 individuals vs. 0 cases/53 individuals) (P\\u2009=\\u20090.026).\\nLS patients, particularly those with atrophic gastritis, are at high risk of gastric neoplasm and often develop multiple tumors. Endoscopic surveillance for gastric cancer is recommended for LS patients, especially those with atrophic gastritis. Ranking fourth in the world in tumor incidence and second in cancer-related death worldwide, gastric cancer (GC) is one of the major malignant tumors, and has a very complicated pathogenesis. In the present study, we aimed to identify new biomarkers to predict the survival rate of GC patients.\\nThe differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GC tissues and normal stomach tissues were obtained by using GEO2R, and overlapped DEGs were acquired with Venn diagrams. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were conducted with R software. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) of these DEGs was visualized by Cytoscape. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was used to verify the expression differences of hub genes in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues and normal tissues. Overall survival (OS) of hub genes was calculated by Kaplan-Meier plotter.\\nThere were a total of 128 consistently expressed genes in the two datasets: 85 upregulated genes were enriched in extra-cellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, focal adhesion, gastric acid secretion, mineral absorption, systemic lupus erythematosus, amoebiasis, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and 43 downregulated genes were enriched in palate development, blood coagulation, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, axonogenesis, receptor internalization, negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, and in no significant signaling pathways. From the PPI network analyzed by Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug-in, all 27 upregulated genes were selected. Furthermore, to analyze the OS among these genes, Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted, and 25 genes were associated with remarkably worse survival. For validation in GEPIA, 11 of 25 genes were discovered to be highly expressed in GC tissues compared to normal OS tissues. Furthermore, in the re-analysis of the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), three genes [G2/miotic-specific cyclin B1 (CCNB1), polo-like kinases 1 (PLK1), and pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 (PTTG1)] were markedly enriched in the cell cycle pathway, particulary the G1-G1/S phase.\\nThree remarkably upregulated DEGs with poor prognosis in GC were identified and may serve as new prognostic biomarkers and targets in GC therapy. Due to the controversy over the prognostic significance of Borrmann type in patients with gastric cancer (GC), the present study was to investigate the clinical value of Borrmann type in advanced GC.\\nWe retrospectively evaluated 2092 patients with advanced GC and subsequently examined the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients stratified by Borrmann type.\\nPatients were divided into three groups according to Borrmann type (Borrmann types I+II, III, and IV). Patients with Borrmann types III and IV had larger size, more poorly differentiated tumor type, more advanced tumor stage, and higher chance of involving the entire stomach. The overall survival (OS) rates were significantly different among the three groups (p < 0.001). Stratification analysis revealed significant OS rates among the three groups in tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage III (p < 0.001) and TNM stage IV (p = 0.008). Multivariate analysis revealed that Borrmann types, adjuvant chemotherapy, curative resection, and TNM stage were all independent predictors of OS among GC patients. The subgroup analysis indicated that Borrmann type was an independent predictor of OS among GC patients who undergone curative resection and with TNM stage III cancer. However, curative resection and postoperative chemotherapy failed to prolong the survival of patients with Borrmann type IV.\\nThe clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with three Borrmann types of GC were different. Borrmann type can be simply used as a valuable factor to predict survival in advanced GC patients, especially in those TNM stage III undergoing curative resection. Additionally, more attention should be paid to the treatment for Borrmann type IV GC. Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cancer in the world and the second most common cancer in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic profiles and prognosis of GC in the upper third (UT), middle third (MT) and low third (LT) of the stomach.Five hundred and forty-two patients with GC resected between January 2010 and January 2014 were retrospectively studied and divided in 3 groups according to cancer location: upper third gastric cancer (UTGC) (n\\u200a=\\u200a62); MTGC (n\\u200a=\\u200a131) and LTGC (n\\u200a=\\u200a349). Clinical and pathological parameters including gender, age, tumor size, macroscopic types, histological types, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, venous infiltration and lymph embolism were compared among groups. Overall survival (OS) was calculated based on the aforementioned parameters. Univariate and multivariate survival was analyzed and Cox regression was conducted for each location. The prognostic accuracy was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Patients with UTGC was similar to those with MTGC and both were distinct from those with LTGC based on the tumor size, macroscopic types, depth of invasion and 5-year OS. Patients with MTGC were similar to those with LTGC and distinct from UTGC patients based on gender. 5-year OS were lower for patients with UTGC than those with LTGC (P\\u200a=\\u200a.001) and were comparable between MTGC and LTGC. No significant differences in 5-year OS were observed between UTGC and MTGC. Cox regression revealed that macroscopic types, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis were the independent prognostic factors for GC patients regardless of locations. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that macroscopic types, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis were the significantly effective prognosis for the 5-year OS in GC patients regardless of locations.Our results showed that UTGC is distinct from LTGC whereas MTGC shares some characteristics from both UTGC and LTGC. In patients with intramucosal gastric cancer (MGC) who have undergone endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), lymphovascular invasions (LVIs) such as lymphatic invasion or venous invasion are considered risk factors of lymph node metastasis (LNM). However, the rate of LNM in MGCs with LVI and their clinicopathological features are unclear.\\nThis study aimed to examine the rate of LNM and clinical characteristics of MGCs with LVI as compared to MGCs without LVI and minimally invasive submucosal gastric cancers (mSMGCs) with LVI.\\nAmong the early gastric cancers excluding the remnant stomach who underwent ESD at our hospital from July 2003 to September 2018, the MGCs with LVI were included as the target in this study. MGCs without LVI and mSMGCs with LVI were also included as control.\\nSeventeen lesions in 17 patients with MGCs with LVI, 1,149 lesions in 865 patients with MGCs without LVI, and 29 lesions in 29 patients with mSMGCs with LVI were analyzed. LVI was noted in 1.5% (17/1,166) of MGC cases. During follow-up of the MGC cases with LVI, there were no LNM or recurrences reported, and 14 patients survived and 3 died of other diseases. However, LNM occurred in 2 cases of mSMGC. Among the MGC cases, univariate analysis showed that the pap component, elevated type, and tumor diameters of 20 mm or more were statistically significant factors with respect to LVI, while multivariate analysis showed that the pap component was the only significant factor.\\nCareful follow-up may be appropriate for MGCs with LVI due to the low risk of LNM. Additionally, the pap component is a significant factor in MGCs with LVI. Colorectal cancer incidence is rising in adults <\\u200950\\xa0years old, possibly due to obesity. Having bariatric surgery (BRS) should hypothetically reduce this trend, but data are limited. This study compared trends of colorectal cancer (CRC) versus other obesity-related gastrointestinal cancers (OGCs) between morbidly obese and post-BRS subjects.\\nThis retrospective cohort study investigated OGC resection trends using the 2006-2013 National Inpatient Sample. Patients with prior BRS and non-BRS controls with body mass index ≥\\u200940\\xa0kg/m\\nBRS patients with OGCs were younger (59.3 vs 62.3\\xa0years old), with more female gender (77.4% vs 57.1%) and White race (72.6% vs 67%) compared with controls (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). The number of CRC resections increased across all ages in 2006-2013, especially rectal cancer for BRS patients (AAPC +\\u200919.8%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). The steepest rise in early-onset CRC resections was after BRS versus a lesser increase in morbid obesity controls (AAPC +\\u200918.7% and +\\u200913.7%, respectively, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In contrast, non-CRC OGCs increased in our controls but not post-BRS. In a sensitivity analysis, estimated CRC incidence trends also increased post-BRS despite adjusting for increasing BRS prevalence.\\nOur findings suggest that bariatric surgery is associated with a persistent increase in early-onset CRC trends. Studies are warranted to validate our results and test the impact of bariatric surgery on early-onset CRC biological mechanisms. Topographical variations of metabolite concentrations have been reported in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of the small intestine, and in human intestinal tumours from those regions, but there are no published metabolite concentrations measurements correlated with linear position in the mouse small intestine or intestinal tumours. Since DNA methylation dynamics are influenced by metabolite concentrations, they too could show linear anatomical variation. We measured metabolites by HR-MAS  This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about stomach (gastric) cancer prevention.

The pancreas is a gland that appears like a thin pear lying on its side behind the stomach and in front of the spine. It has four parts: the head (wider part of the gland), neck, body (middle section), and tail (narrow end). Physiologically, the pancreas has endocrine and exocrine cells. The endocrine cells release hormones like insulin and glucagon to regulate blood glucose. Clusters of these endocrine cells in the pancreas are also known as islets. The exocrine cells release hormones into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of the food. These cells line the end of the ducts, which are present throughout the pancreas.[1] Tumors of neuroendocrine origin emerging in the pancreas or in proximity to the pancreas are described as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or islet cell tumors of the pancreas.[2] Gastric resection remains the preferred surgical treatment option for many benign and malignant diseases of the stomach.[1]\\xa0Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide in which gastric resection or total gastrectomy remains the only strategy for long-term survival and hope for a cure.[2][3][4]\\xa0Subtotal gastrectomy is the removal of 70-80% of the distal stomach, whereas total gastrectomy is the removal of the entire stomach, including the pylorus. Despite a steady decline in the incidence and mortality of gastric carcinoma observed over the last century, the absolute number of cases increases annually due to an aging population.[4][5]\\xa0Early diagnosis of gastric carcinoma is very uncommon, and the incidence of nodal metastases is high.[6]\\xa0Lymphatic spread is the most important prognostic factor in gastric cancer; therefore, adequate lymphadenectomy is required for curative resection as well as staging.[5]\\xa0 Gastric cancers can be divided into the intestinal type and diffuse type. The most common underlying etiology of intestinal-type carcinoma is  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth common cause of cancer death, and its 5-year survival rate is only about 12% despite the advancement in medical care, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular biology. The pancreatoduodenectomy, also known as the Whipple procedure,\\xa0 is the surgical procedure of choice for the resectable and the borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.[1] This surgical procedure poses immense difficulties to the surgeons due to the complex as well as highly difficult intra-abdominal dissection and likewise the repair of the digestion system.[1] Due to its complex nature, this procedure has historically been associated with higher mortality and perioperative morbidity.[1] Historically, the first pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed by Dr. Alessandro Codivilla, an Italian surgeon, in 1898 and was later modified by Dr. Walter Kausch in 1912. The surgery was then performed as a two-stage procedure, and Dr. Allen Whipple further improved it into a one-stage Whipple procedure in 1940.[2][3]\\xa0Later on, it was established that this procedure is associated with\\xa0a high mortality rate; however, with improving medical knowledge and surgical advancement, there has been a significant drop in mortality. With an experienced surgeon in high-load hospitals, the mortality rate drops to about 3% to 5%.[4] Broadly, there are two types of pancreatoduodenectomies; the more extensive \" Small Bowel Cancer encompasses a series of malignant lesions that may be identified throughout the small intestine (SI). The small bowel lies between the stomach and the large intestine (LI/Colon) and is encompassed by three different sections, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum to the level of the ileocecal valve which provides the terminal transition point between the SI and the LI.\\xa0While there are both benign and malignant lesions that can be identified throughout the SI, the overall incidence of small bowel neoplasms is extremely low when compared to lesions noted in other portions of the gastrointestinal tract. This article will focus on the overall characteristics, diagnostics, treatment and prognosis of malignant lesions. Majority of these lesions cause multiple non specific symptoms which very often lead to delay in diagnosis and therefore delay in early intervention with available treatment strategies. Common clinical features include abdominal pain, anorexia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and weight loss. More advanced processes can present with perforation, small bowel obstruction, or obstructive jaundice. Diagnosis can be variable based on location of the lesion under investigation and generally consists of laboratory studies, radiographic imaging and endoscopic evaluation. Malignant lesions overall include lymphomas, neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids), adenocarcinomas and stromal tumors.\\xa0[1] A gastrojejunostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an anastomosis between the stomach and the jejunum. It can be performed in either a hand-sewn or a stapled fashion, either open or laparoscopically. Some centers have even created gastrojejunostomies endoscopically.[1]\\xa0 There are several\\xa0reasons\\xa0to develop a jejunostomy, including bypass obstructions, as part of a weight-loss procedure, and as part of a reconstruction after gastric resection. The\\xa0first successful gastrojejunostomy was performed by Anton Woelfer in 1881 to bypass a cancer of the pylorus.[2]\\xa0However, the creation of a gastrojejunostomy where the stomach is anastomosed to the jejunum without creating a separate limb for pancreatobiliary\\xa0secretions is known as a Billroth II procedure after Woelfer\\'s teacher, Dr. Theodor Bilroth, even though Billroth did not perform his first successful gastrojejunostomy until 1885.[3]\\xa0 The procedure where a gastric remnant is anastomosed to a loop of the jejunum and an additional jejunojejunostomy is created known as a Roux-en-Y procedure after Cesar Roux. He popularized it in 1887, although Anton Woelfer also performed the first Roux-en-Y procedure in 1883.[4] The present study was conducted to determine the trend and projection of premature mortality from gastrointestinal cancers (GI cancers) at national and subnational levels in Iran.\\nEmploying the data obtained from Iranian Death Registry System (DRS) and population data from census, the mortality rates of GI cancers was calculated among 30-70 age groups. The trends of esophageal, colon and rectum, gallbladder, pancreases, stomach, and liver cancer premature mortalities were estimated and projected at the national and subnational levels from 2001 to 2030. Then, Spatio-temporal model was used to project spatial and temporal correlations.\\nThe overall mortality rate of GI cancers was higher in males than in females, indicating 6.1, 3.9 and 3.9% per 100,000 individuals among males in 2001, 2015 and 2030 respectively and 3.8, 3.1 and 3.7 per 100,000 individuals among females in the same time-frame. The overall mortality rate of GI cancers in males was decreasing until 2015 and will remain stationary into 2030; however, the rate will be increasing among females in both time-frames. Also, there was a considerable variation in the mortality trends of different cancers. Pancreatic, gallbladder, and liver cancers were shown to have an increasing trend while a drop was observed in the mortality rates of stomach, colon and rectum, and esophageal cancers.\\nVariation of GI cancers patterns and trends around the country indicated that a more comprehensive control plan is needed to include the predicted variations. Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer associated with asbestos exposure with median survival time of 8 to 14 months following diagnosis. Given that mesothelial cells also line the peritoneum and pericardium, malignant mesothelioma can present in unusual sites and in patients with nonrespiratory complaints. A 73-year-old male presented to the emergency department for worsening intermittent diffuse abdominal pain for the past 3 months with associated unintentional 40-pound weight loss, early satiety, and diarrhea. He denied exposure to asbestos. Computed tomography imaging revealed multiple masses concerning for malignancy including the primary retroperitoneal mass, a mass involving the terminal ileum, and a mass in the right upper lung. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated significant mass effect within the stomach without signs of endoluminal infiltration. Computed tomography-guided biopsy of the retroperitoneal abdominal and intramuscular paraspinal masses was performed. Stage IV epithelioid mesothelioma was confirmed when hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed pleomorphic malignancy nuclei containing a vesicular chromatin pattern and prominent nucleoli and immunohistochemical staining was positive for CK Oscar, cytokeratin 7, GATA3, calretinin, EMA, and CK5/6. He was started on cisplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab but developed severe abdominal pain with pneumoperitoneum and bowel perforation 1 month later and expired shortly thereafter. To our knowledge, this represents a highly atypical presentation of malignant mesothelioma considering the involvement of the retroperitoneum with diffuse lesions in the abdominopelvic cavity and thorax (sparing the lung pleurae). This case also calls attention to the occurrence of malignant mesothelioma in patients without known asbestos exposure and the crucial role of pathology in diagnosing atypical presentations. \\u2002White globe appearance (WGA), a small white lesion with a globular shape that can be clearly visualized by magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI), was reported to be a reliable marker of early gastric cancer (EGC). However, we found that this endoscopic presentation could also be seen in non-cancerous tissues, especially in ulcerative lesions. This study aimed to further investigate the diagnostic value of WGA in differentiating non-cancerous lesions from EGC in ulcer-type cases.\\n\\u2002We retrospectively reviewed 54\\xa0cases of EGC and 155 cases of non-cancerous lesions in this study, all of which had endoscopic imaging data of ME-NBI scanning and pathological data of biopsy or resected specimens. The correlation of the prevalence of WGA and ulcerative lesions, as well as the characteristics of WGA between the 2 groups were analyzed in this study.\\n\\u2002WGA was more common in ulcerative lesions (27.6\\u200a%, 21/76) than in non-ulcerative lesions (3.8\\u200a%, 5/133) (p\\u200a<\\u200a0.001) in our study. In the ulcerative cases, no significant difference in prevalence of WGA was observed between EGC and non-cancerous lesions (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.532). Compared with WGA in EGC, WGA in non-cancerous lesions tended to show the characteristic of tree-branch-like vessels on globular shape (p\\u200a<\\u200a0.001).\\n\\u2002WGA is more likely to occur in ulcerative lesions, and the presence of WGA alone cannot distinguish EGC from non-cancerous lesions in ulcer-type cases. In WGA-positive tissue, tree-branch-like vessels of globular shape may provide a certain clinical value in diagnosis of non-cancerous lesions or EGC.\\n\\u2002Das White Globe Appearance (WGA) ist eine kleine weiße Läsion mit einer Kugelform, die durch Vergrößerungsendoskopie mit Schmalband-Bildgebung (magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging, ME-NBI) identifiziert werden kann. WGA wurde zuvor als zuverlässiger Marker für die Diagnose von frühem Magenkrebs (early gastric cancer, EGC) unter ME-NBI angesehen. Wir fanden jedoch heraus, dass diese Manifestation auch in nicht krebsartigen Geweben auftreten kann, insbesondere in ulzerativen Läsionen. Diese Studie zielt darauf, den diagnostischen Wert von WGA bei der Unterscheidung zwsichen nicht krebsartigen Läsionen und EGC in ulzerativen Läsionen weiter zu untersuchen.\\n\\u2002Retrospektiv analysierten wir 54 EGC-Fälle und 155\\xa0Nicht-Krebs-Läsionen. Alle Fälle wurden von ME-NBI untersucht und dazu liegen entsprechende pathologische Daten von Biopsie- oder Resektionsproben vor. Die Beziehung zwischen der Inzidenz von WGA und ulzerativen Läsionen und die Eigenschaften von WGA in den beiden Gruppen von Läsionen wurden weiter analysiert.\\n\\u2002Die Inzidenz von WGA bei ulzerativen Läsionen (27,6\\u200a%, 21/76) war signifikant höher als bei nicht ulzerativen Läsionen (3,8\\u200a%, 5/76) (P <\\u200a0,001). Bei ulzerativen Läsionen gab es keinen signifikanten statistisch Unterschied in der WGA-positiven Rate zwischen der EGC-Gruppe und der Nicht-Krebsläsionsgruppe (p\\u200a=\\u200a0,532). Im Vergleich zu WGA bei EGC zeigte WGA tendenziell bei nicht krebsartigen Läsionen die Eigenschaften dendritischer Gefäße (p\\u200a<\\u200a0,001).\\n\\u2002WGA tritt tendenziell bei ulzerativen Läsionen auf, aber das Vorhandensein von WGA kann ulzerative EGC nicht von nicht krebsbedingten Läsionen unterscheiden. Bei WGA-positiven Läsionen hat das Auftreten dendritischer Gefäße in einer kugelförmigen Struktur einen bestimmten klinischen Wert für die Differentialdiagnose von EGC oder Nichtkrebsläsionen. The present study compared the expression levels of limb-bud and heart (LBH) between gastric intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (GITA) and healthy gastric tissues; with the aim of investigating the possible effect of LBH on the prognosis of patients with GITA and to analyze the associated signaling pathways in GITA. Three Oncomine gastric datasets were utilized for the preliminary prediction of the expression levels of LBH mRNA in GITA and healthy gastric tissues. Gene expression and corresponding clinical data of 163 patients with GITA were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test was used to distinguish the clinical value of LBH expression in the various clinicopathological features. Subsequently, Kaplan-Meier univariate and Cox multivariate survival analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance of LBH expression in patients with GITA. Function enrichment analysis was conducted for the co-expression gene of LBH, defined as correlation coefficient r>0.06 and P<0.05 using Pearson\\'s χ The human gastrointestinal tract harbors approximately 100 trillion microorganisms with different microbial compositions across geographic locations. In this work, we used RNASeq data from stomach samples of non-disease (164 individuals from European ancestry) and gastric cancer patients (137 from Europe and Asia) from public databases. Although these data were intended to characterize the human expression profiles, they allowed for a reliable inference of the microbiome composition, as confirmed from measures such as the genus coverage, richness and evenness. The microbiome diversity (weighted UniFrac distances) in gastric cancer mimics host diversity across the world, with European gastric microbiome profiles clustering together, distinct from Asian ones. Despite the confirmed loss of microbiome diversity from a healthy status to a cancer status, the structured profile was still recognized in the disease condition. In concordance with the parallel host-bacteria population structure, we found 16 human loci (non-synonymous variants) in the European-descendent cohorts that were significantly associated with specific genera abundance. These microbiome quantitative trait loci display heterogeneity between population groups, being mainly linked to the immune system or cellular features that may play a role in enabling microbe colonization and inflammation. Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) with daily MR-imaging has the potential to improve dosimetric accuracy by accounting for inter-fractional anatomical changes. This study provides an assessment for the feasibility and potential benefits of online adaptive MRI-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for treatment of liver cancer.\\nTen patients with liver cancer treated with MR-Guided SBRT were included. Prescription doses ranged between 27 and 50\\xa0Gy in 3-5 fx. All SBRT fractions employed daily MR-guided setup while utilizing cine-MR gating. Organs-at-risk (OARs) included duodenum, bowel, stomach, kidneys and spinal cord. Daily MRIs and contours were utilized to create each adapted plan. Adapted plans used the beam-parameters and optimization-objectives from the initial plan. Planning target volume (PTV) coverage and OAR constraints were used to compare non-adaptive and adaptive plans.\\nPTV coverage for non-adapted treatment plans was below the prescribed coverage for 32/47 fractions (68%), with 11 fractions failing by more than 10%. All 47 adapted fractions met prescribed coverage. OAR constraint violations were also compared for several organs. The duodenum exceeded tolerance for 5/23 non-adapted and 0/23 for adapted fractions. The bowel exceeded tolerance for 5/34 non-adaptive and 1/34 adaptive fractions. The stomach exceeded tolerance for 4/19 non-adapted and 1/19 for adaptive fractions. Accumulated dose volume histograms were also generated for each patient.\\nOnline adaptive MR-Guided SBRT of liver cancer using daily re-optimization resulted in better target conformality, coverage and OAR sparing compared with non-adaptive SBRT. Daily adaptive planning may allow for PTV dose escalation without compromising OAR sparing. Evidence of the effects of cancer prevention knowledge on the risk of developing cancer remains scarce. The objective of this study was to prospectively examine the association of cancer prevention awareness levels with cancer risk in a population-based cancer screening cohort in China.\\nThis prospective cohort study included 164,341 participants aged 40 to 69 years with no history of cancer and with available information on cancer prevention core knowledge in the Esophageal, Stomach, and Liver Cancer Screening Program. Participants were recruited from 18 rural regions across 4 provinces in China from 2007 to 2014 and were followed until December 31, 2015. The core knowledge of cancer prevention content included 9 items, with a total score ranging from 0 to 100. Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic spline analysis were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs.\\nHigh cancer prevention knowledge scores were inversely associated with the overall risk of cancer (group 4 vs group 1: hazard ratio, 0.669; 95% CI, 0.576-0.776). Subgroup analysis showed that this inverse association could be observed in women, participants with lower educational or income levels, and those without a family history of cancer. Restricted cubic spline analysis exhibited a nonlinear (L-shaped) relation between cancer knowledge scores and cancer risk (overall P\\xa0<\\xa0.0001; nonlinear P\\xa0=\\xa0.0141).\\nThe main finding of this prospective study was that higher levels of cancer prevention awareness could be associated with a relative reduction in the risk of developing cancer. The incidence of metachronous multiple gastric cancer (MMGC) after gastrectomy remains unclear. This study evaluated the incidences of MMGC according to specific gastrectomy types, including pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG), proximal gastrectomy (PG), and function-preserving gastrectomy (FPG), which was categorized as segmental gastrectomy and local resection.\\nWe conducted a questionnaire survey of the Japanese Society for Gastro-Surgical Pathophysiology members, who were asked to report their institutional numbers of radical gastrectomy cases for cancer between 2003 and 2012. The cases were categorized according to whether the remnant stomach\\'s status was followed for\\u2009>\\u20095\\xa0years, confirmation of MMGC, time to diagnosis, and treatment for MMGC. We calculated the \"precise incidence\" of MMGC by dividing the number of MMGC cases by the number of cases in which the status of remnant stomach was followed up for\\u2009>\\u20095\\xa0years.\\nThe responses identified 33,731 cases of gastrectomy. The precise incidences of MMGC were 2.35% after distal gastrectomy (DG), 3.01% after PPG, 6.28% after PG (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and 8.21% after FPG (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). A substantial proportion of MMGCs (36.4%) was found at 5\\xa0years after the initial surgery. The rates of MMGC treatment using endoscopic submucosal dissection were 31% after DG, 28.6% after PPG, 50.8% after PG (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and 67.9% after FPG (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).\\nThe incidence of MMGC was 2.4% after DG, and higher incidences were observed for larger stomach remnants. However, the proportion of cases in which MMGC could be treated using endoscopic submucosal dissection was significantly higher after PG and FPG than after DG. Tumor regression grade (TRG) has been widely used in gastrointestinal carcinoma to assess pathological responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). There are various standards without a consensus, and it is still unclear which kind of system has better predictive value. This study aims to investigate and compare the predictive ability of the Mandard and Becker TRGs in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.\\nA total of 290 patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent NCT and curative surgery were studied. Survival analysis for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were based on the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards method. Predictive values of TRGs and models were assessed by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curve (AUC), nomogram, and calibration curve.\\nIn multivariable analysis, the Mandard TRG was associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.806; p=0.026) and DFS (HR, 1.792; p=0.017). The Becker TRG was also related to OS (HR, 1.880; p=0.014) and DFS (HR, 1.919; p=0.006). The Mandard and Becker TRG AUCs for five-year survival were 0.72 and 0.71, respectively. The whole models showed an increased predictive value, with AUCs of 0.85 and 0.86, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two TRGs and two models.\\nTRG was an independent predictor for survival, and there was no significant difference between these two systems. Gastric cancer is the most common malignant tumor. Most patients suffering from gastric cancer die of metastasis. The role of Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in inhibiting and eliminating kinds of cancer cells has been reported. Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway contributes to initiation and progression of various malignancies. We have previously reported that the inhibitor of Hh, cyclopamine, reduces the metastatic activity of MGC-803 via inhibiting the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9. It remains to be further demonstrated that ANP has the suppressive effects on invasion and metastasis in gastric cancer via Hh-mediated MMP-9 production.\\nTranswell, western blot, qRT-PCR were used after application of ANP on MGC-803 gastric cancer cells to determine the levels of cell migration and invasion, protein levels of MMP-9 and Hh, as well as mRNAs of MMP-9 and Hh, respectively.\\nIt was demonstrated that the migration and invasion were significantly lower, MMP-9 and Hh as well as their mRNAs were lower as well, in ANP-treated MGC-803 gastric cancer cells than those in control.\\nThe expression of MMP-9 induced by aberrant activation of Hh in MGC-803 was inhibited by ANP, which may contribute to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion. These results suggested the potential of ANP to be used in gastric cancer therapy as an inhibitor targetting Hh signaling pathway to inhibit the proliferation as well as invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer. A heterodimeric receptor subunit, Integrin αV, often complexed with Integrin β3 plays a vital role in cell signaling to regulate angiogenesis and promote cancer progression. The paramount β-turn formed from pentapeptide residues (PPQEE) in the cytoplasmic domain of Integrin αV was previously reported as crucial for cell signaling and its deletion was proved deleterious for protein\\'s cell membrane adhesion and ligand binding properties. This study revealed conformational changes in the Integrin αV subunit upon deletion of PPQEE residues through in silico structural modelling approach followed by analysis of alteration of binding sites. Human Protein Atlas database helped to identify the association of Integrin αV to the unfavourable prognosis of three gastrointestinal cancers: stomach, liver and pancreatic cancers. Molecular modelling and docking techniques were carried out for the necessary complex formations (wild-type and mutant-type). Further comparison was performed for the complexes. The changes in protein\\'s conformation and stability due to PPQEE deletion were observed in both independent subunit and heterodimer. The most noteworthy conformational shift was the disruption of a transmembrane helix into coil, which accounted for protein\\'s impaired cell membrane adhesion, increased solvent accessibility and decreased stability. The deletion also caused a reduction of beta-turn regions, which disrupted ligand binding in the cytoplasmic domain of Integrin αV subunit. This study emphasized on structural basis of how the deletion of PPQEE residues alters stability, ligand binding and signaling activity of Integrin αV subunit highlighting the importance of these residues in maintenance of protein\\'s native structure. In medical studies, it is often observed that a portion of subjects will never experience the event of interest and thus can be treated as cured or long-term survivors. Many populations of early-stage cancer patients contain both uncured and cured individuals that should be modeled using cure models. In prognostic studies, the cure status (uncure or cure) is an issue of interest for medical practitioners, and the disease status (death or alive) of an individual is not a fixed characteristic and it varies along the time. These statuses are usually predicted by a prognostic risk score. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a powerful tool to evaluate these predicting performances dynamically. In the context with a cure fraction, quantifying and estimating the predictive performances of the risk score is a challenge since the disease status and cure status are both unknown among individuals who are censored. In this paper, to assess the predictive accuracy for the survival outcome with a cure fraction, we propose a time-dependent ROC curve semi-parametric estimator based on the sieve maximum likelihood (ML) estimation under the mixture cure model. We also apply a Bernstein-based smoothing method in the estimation procedure, and this estimator can lead to substantial gain in efficiency. In addition, we derive the time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC) to summarize the discriminatory capacity of the risk score globally. Finally, we evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods by extensive simulations and illustrate the estimation using two real data sets, one from a melanoma study and the other from stomach cancer. Tumors located in the pylorus are technically more complex to resect by endoscopic resection, as the anatomical characteristics of this region can affect the adequate assessment of margins and performance of the procedure. We reported the results of underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) of benign mucosal neoplasms located in the pyloric ring.\\nThis case series describes 4 patients with 4 mucosal neoplasms located in the pyloric ring. The diameter of each neoplasm was less than 15 mm. We performed UEMR for the lesions. Water immersion enabled slight floating of the lesions, resulting in easy identification. We achieved en bloc resection with a snare and electrosurgical unit. All procedure were performed within 3 min without adverse events. Pathologic examination showed low-grade dysplasia with clear resection margins in one case and hyperplastic polyps in three cases.\\nUEMR can be an effective and safe treatment method for neoplasms in the gastric pyloric ring.  Gastrointestinal malignancies have both a high incidence rate and a high mortality rate. Immuno-oncological treatment approaches are becoming increasingly established in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers.\\nIn this review, we give an overview of the types and effects of immunotherapies. We focus on recent studies on immunotherapies with special attention to immune checkpoint inhibition in carcinomas of the esophagus and stomach, the hepato-pancreatico-biliary system, and the colorectum including the anal channel in the metastatic setting, and we show their achievements but also their limitations. In an outlook, we discuss new approaches in immunotherapy like CAR T-cell therapy and oncolytic viruses.\\nGastrointestinal cancers show overall moderate response rates to immunotherapy. Nevertheless, subgroups such as DNA mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite-instable tumors particularly benefit from the immune checkpoint blockade. Further studies are ongoing. Inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFPs) are infrequent gastrointestinal tract benign neoplasms. They mostly occur in the stomach especially the antrum. Signs and symptoms depend on their anatomic location and lesion size. Lesion biopsies are very challenging for accurate diagnosis in these lesions. Histopathological examination of resected tissue along with immunohistochemical studies is the perfect way to confirm the final diagnosis. In this paper, the authors present an unusual case of IFP in a 23-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room (ER) with a picture of intestinal obstruction and severe abdominal pain. Her investigations revealed a huge mass located at the ileocecal valve, with overall features mimic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) clinical presentation. Surgical resection is considered the most commonly used treatment method. The overall prognosis is good with a low risk of recurrence. Cancer prevails in various gastrointestinal (GI) organs, such as esophagus, stomach, and colon. However, the small intestine has an extremely low cancer risk. It is interesting to investigate the molecular cues that could explain the significant difference in cancer incidence rates among different GI tissues. Using several large-scale normal and cancer tissue genomics datasets, we compared the gene expression profiling between small intestine and other GI tissues and between GI cancers and normal tissues. We identified 17 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) which showed significantly higher expression levels in small intestine than in other GI tissues and significantly lower expression levels in GI cancers than in normal tissues. These TSGs were mainly involved in metabolism, immune, and cell growth signaling-associated pathways. Many TSGs had a positive expression correlation with survival prognosis in various cancers, confirming their tumor suppressive function. We demonstrated that the downregulation of many TSGs was associated with their hypermethylation in cancer. Moreover, we showed that the expression of many TSGs inversely correlated with tumor purity and positively correlated with antitumor immune response in various cancers, suggesting that these TSGs may exert their tumor suppressive function by promoting antitumor immunity. Furthermore, we identified a transcriptional regulatory network of the TSGs and their master transcriptional regulators (MTRs). Many of MTRs have been recognized as tumor suppressors, such as HNF4A, ZBTB7A, p53, and RUNX3. The TSGs could provide new molecular cues associated with tumorigenesis and tumor development and have potential clinical implications for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Cutaneous metastases from visceral carcinomas are relatively uncommon, with an overall incidence ranging from 0.7 to 9%. Diagnosis of scalp metastases usually escapes clinicians and dermatologists due to the fact that these metastases are mimicking other benign dermatological conditions. Herein, we present an uncommon case of scalp alopecia neoplastica mimicking alopecia areata due to breast cancer; a 43-year-old woman diagnosed with lobular cancer 3 years previously presented with acute loss of hair in well-circumscribed areas of the scalp and was diagnosed with alopecia areata by a private-practice dermatologist. She was then reevaluated, and due to her history of breast cancer, a biopsy from the scalp was performed and revealed alopecia neoplastica. At the same time that the skin lesions were recognized as disease involvement, the patient presented with dyspepsia, and endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract also revealed metastasis to the stomach and bowel. Gastrointestinal metastasis may occur with several types of cancer, but the stomach and bowel are rare metastatic sites for breast cancer. Some cases of gastric low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) on forceps biopsy (FB) are diagnosed as gastric cancer (GC) after endoscopic resection (ER). This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ER for gastric LGD and HGD on pretreatment FB and to identify the factors that predict pathologic upstaging to GC.\\nPatients who underwent ER for LGD and HGD on pretreatment FB from March 2005 to February 2018 in 14 hospitals in South Korea were enrolled, and the patients\\' medical records were reviewed retrospectively.\\nThis study included 2,150 cases of LGD and 1,534 cases of HGD diagnosed by pretreatment FB. In total, 589 of 2,150 LGDs (27.4%) were diagnosed as GC after ER. \\nA substantial proportion of LGDs and HGDs on pretreatment FB were diagnosed as GC after ER. Accurate ER procedures such as endoscopic submucosal dissection should be recommended in cases of LGD and HGD with factors predicting pathologic upstaging to GC. This review provides an overview of different types of gastric epithelial polyps. The polyps are classified based on their cell or epithelial compartment of origin. Some of these polyps can be considered reactive or nonneoplastic, whereas others are neoplastic in origin, are sometimes associated with a hereditary polyposis/cancer syndrome, and may have malignant potential. The aim of this review is to provide a pragmatic overview for the practicing pathologist about how to correctly diagnose and deal with gastric epithelial polyps and when (not) to ponder, and when (not) to panic. H. pylori-associated gastritis: diagnostic, treatment and surveillance  There are racial and ethnic differences in the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma worldwide and in the United States. Based on a decision analysis, screening for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma might be cost-effective for non-White individuals 50 years or older. However, a lack of precise, contemporary information on gastric adenocarcinoma incidence in specific anatomic sites for this age group has impeded prevention and early detection programs in the United States. We aimed to estimate the differences in gastric adenocarcinoma incidence in specific anatomic sites among races and ethnicities in individuals 50 years or older.\\nWe analyzed California Cancer Registry data from 2011 through 2015 to estimate incidences of gastric adenocarcinoma in specific anatomic sites for non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and the 7 largest Asian American populations. We calculated the differential incidence between non-White groups and NHW using incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\\nCompared with NHW subjects, all non-White groups had significantly higher incidences of noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma; the incidence was highest among Korean American men 50 years and older (70 cases per 100,000). Compared with NHW subjects 50 years and older, the risk of noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma was 1.8-fold (95% CI, 1.37-2.31) to 7.3-fold (95% CI, 5.73-9.19) higher in most non-White groups and 12.0-fold (95% CI, 9.96-14.6) to 14.5-fold (95% CI, 12.5-16.9) higher among Korean American men and women 50 years and older, respectively. Compared with NHW men 50 years and older, all non-White men, except Japanese and Korean American men, had a significantly lower risk of cardia gastric adenocarcinoma.\\nWe identified several-fold differences in incidences of gastric adenocarcinoma in specific anatomic sites among racial and ethnic groups, with significant age and sex differences. These findings can be used to develop targeted risk reduction programs for gastric adenocarcinoma. Kanglaite injection is a broad-spectrum anti-tumor drug, which is extracted from the seeds of the Chinese medicinal herb Coix lacryma-jobi, and has been widely used for the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). This study aimed to systematically investigate the efficacy and safety of Kanglaite injection for the treatment of GC.\\nWe will perform the comprehensive literature search in English and Chinese electronic database from its inception to June 2020. Two trained researchers will independently select the qualified studies for data extraction and assess the quality and risk of bias. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool will be used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. The outcomes included overall response rate, complete response rate, 3-year progression-free survival rate, 3-year overall survival rate, and different types of treatment-related adverse events. Funnel plot analysis and Egger test will be used to assess the publication bias. Finally, the quality of evidence will be assessed by the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluate system . We will calculate the risk ratio as well as their 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes and pool the results using RevMan 5.4 software and STATA 16.0 software.\\nThe results of our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\\nThe conclusion of our systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether Kanglaite injection is an effective intervention for patient with GC.\\n10.17605/OSF.IO/HF679. The high morbidity and mortality of Gastric cancer (GC) is seriously endangered human health. Owing to the low rate of early diagnosis and human body can resistant to the anti-tumor drugs, so an early diagnostic biology marker is essential. However, recently studies indicated that Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is usually frequently deregulated in many cancers, especially in GC. And the efficacy of mTOR inhibitor was promising in a phase II clinical trial which could inhibited the proliferation of GC cells and delayed tumor progression. Therefore, mTOR were identified as a potential prognosis biomarker for GC, and its inhibitor will be promising in anti-GC therapy. The main aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the relationships between the expression level and prognostic value of mTOR in patients with GC.\\nFour electronic databases were systematically searched as follow: the PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science databases, and the Cochrane Library. All the data will be extracted by independent researchers from the eligible studies with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. And the data will be analyzed through STATA 12.0 software.\\nThis meta-analysis indicated that overexpressed mTOR was significantly in predicting a poorer prognosis for GC patients. The expression level of mTOR should be considered as a potential independent prognostic predictor for GC patients.\\nCRD42020159690. Helicobacter pylori causes dangerous and deadly diseases such as gastric cancer and duodenal ulcers. Eradication and treatment of this bacterium are very important due to the deadly diseases caused by H. pylori and the high cost of treatment for countries. So, we present a complete list of the most important causes of failure in the treatment and eradication of H. pylori, and addresses new therapeutic methods that may be effective in controlling this bacterium in the future.\\nMany efforts have been made to control and eradicate this bacterium over the years, but no success has been achieved since its eradication is a complex process affected by the bacterial properties and host factors. Previous studies have shown that various factors are involved in failure to eradicate H. pylori, such as new genotypes of the bacterium with higher pathogenicity, inappropriate patient cooperation, mutations, biofilm formation and dormant forms that cause antibiotic resistance, acidic stomach pH, high bacterial load, smoking, immunosuppressive features and intracellular occurrence of H. pylori. On the other hand, recent studies reported that the use of probiotics, nanoparticles, antimicrobial peptides, natural product and vaccine can be helpful in the treatment and eradication of H. pylori infections.\\nEradication of H. pylori is crucial for the treatment of important diseases such as gastric cancer. Therefore, it seems that identifying the failure causes of treating this bacterium can be helpful in controlling the infections. Besides, further studies on new therapeutic strategies may help eradicate H. pylori in the future. Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignancy with high morbidity/mortality, partly due to a lack of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. It is important to develop reliable biomarker(s) with specificity, sensitivity and convenience for early diagnosis. The role of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and survival of GC patients are controversial. Macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) regulates monocytes/macrophages. Elevated MCSF is correlated with invasion, metastasis and poor survival of tumour patients. IL-34, a ligand of the M-CSF receptor, acts as a \"twin\" to M-CSF, demonstrating overlapping and complimentary actions. IL-34 involvement in tumours is controversial, possibly due to the levels of M-CSF receptors. While the IL-34/M-CSF/M-CSFR axis is very important for regulating macrophage differentiation, the specific interplay between these cytokines, macrophages and tumour development is unclear.\\nA multi-factorial evaluation could provide more objective utility, particularly for either prediction and/or prognosis of gastric cancer. Precision medicine requires molecular diagnosis to determine the specifically mutant function of tumours, and is becoming popular in the treatment of malignancy. Therefore, elucidating specific molecular signalling pathways in specific cancers facilitates the success of a precision medicine approach. Gastric cancer tissue arrays were generated from stomach samples with TNM stage, invasion depth and the demography of these patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009185). Using immunohistochemistry/histopathology, M-CSF, IL-34 and macrophages were determined.\\nWe found that IL-34 may serve as a predictive biomarker, but not as an independent, prognostic factor in GC; M-CSF inversely correlated with survival of GC in TNM III-IV subtypes. Increased CD68\\nOur data support the potency of IL-34, M-CSF, TAMs and the combination of IL-34/TAMs as novel biological markers for GC, and may provide new insight for both diagnosis and cellular therapy of GC. Gastric cancer is usually an age-related disease and mostly diagnosed after the sixth decade of life, though it may also be diagnosed earlier.\\nThe aim of this study is to explore the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of gastric carcinoma in young patients.\\nA total of 1379 patients younger than 75 years histologically diagnosed with primary gastric carcinoma underwent gastrectomy. Patients were categorized into three groups based on their age which included young age group (≤40 years), middle-aged group (age 41-60 years), and elderly group (age 61-75 years). The young age group was further subdivided into two groups: Group A (age ≤35 years) and Group B (age 35-40 years). The analysis of the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis followed thereafter.\\nFemales predominate in young group (\\nThe young age groups of patients were predominantly female and had a higher proportion of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated type of tumor; moreover, patients aged <35 years had a poor prognosis. In addition, gastric cancer can occur in patients less than 30 years old, and symptoms suggestive of gastric cancer should be investigated aggressively; therefore, a close scrutiny and monitoring should be done in younger patients especially those associated with high-risk factors which could indicate the presence of the disease at an early stage. Epigenetic DNA base methylation plays important roles in gene expression regulation. We here describe a gene expression regulation network consisting of many DNA methyltransferases each frequently changing its target sequence-specificity. Our object  To prepare xanthatin (XA)-loaded polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles (PDA-XA-NPs) and to investigate their adhesion and bioavailability.\\nPDA-XA-NPs were synthesized and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential analysis and encapsulation efﬁciency analysis. Their in vitro release kinetics and inhibitory effects on gastric cancer were studied. The adhesion of PDA-XA-NPs was evaluated by in vivo imaging atlas. The pharmacokinetics of PDA-XA-NPs and XA was compared.\\nPDA-XA-NPs had a spherical shape, a particle size of about 380 nm, an encapsulation efficiency of (82.1 ± 0.02) % and a drug loading capacity of (5.5 ± 0.1)%. The release of PDA-XA-NPs in PBS was stable and slow, without being affected by pH. The adhesion capacity of PDA-XA-NPs for mucin was significantly higher than that of bulk drug. The gastric mucosal retention of PDA-XA-NPs reached 89.1% which significantly exceeded that of XA. In vivo imaging showed that PDA-XA-NPs targeting the stomach were retained for a period of time. The pharmacokinetics study showed that PDA-XA-NPs had a longer retention time and a slower drug release than those of XA. In vitro experiments confirmed that PDA-XA-NPs exerted similar inhibitory effects on gastric cancer to those of XA, which lasted for a period of time.\\nHigh-adhesion NPs were constructed. Gastric cancer was targeted by orally administered PDA-XA-NPs, as a potentially feasible therapy. Eventually, the bioavailability of XA was increased. Nutritional guidelines suggest specific energy and protein requirements for patients with cancer. However, cancer patients, often malnourished, use self-made or web-based diets to ameliorate the prognosis of their disease. This review aimed to investigate the associations between post-diagnostic diet and prognostic outcomes in cancer patients. A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed and Web of Science databases from inception to 30 October 2019, based on fixed inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed. A total of 29 prospective studies was identified. Breast ( Non-Helicobacter pylori microbiota might account for some cases with unexplained chronic gastritis that may in a minority eventually progress to gastric cancer through the Correa cascade. We characterized gastric microbiota by describing the normal stomach, compared it with early precancerous lesions and other disease states, and assessed whether H. pylori status affects bacterial diversity.\\nIn a population-based study of those with and without gastrointestinal symptoms, cytology brush samples were collected during endoscopy from 316 individuals. Mucosal status was classified as normal mucosa (171), nonatrophic H. pylori gastritis (33), atrophic gastritis (12), or antral chemical gastritis (61). The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis were performed to characterize the microbiota.\\nMicrobiota in atrophic gastritis and nonatrophic H. pylori gastritis stomachs were dysbiotic and differed from those in the normal stomach (P = 0.001). The normal stomach had the highest microbial diversity, followed by antral chemical gastritis. The atrophic gastritis and chronic H. pylori gastritis groups had the lowest diversity, a difference that was statistically significant (P = 0.01). Besides H. pylori, non-H. pylori bacteria accounted for group differences. Microbial network analysis showed that the normal group network was most highly connected, whereas the H. pylori gastritis group had the lowest connection. We found an increasing positive co-occurrence of oral bacteria in the stomach because samples deviated from the normal network, some of which were pathogens. The H. pylori-negative group had the highest microbial diversity (Shannon index) compared with the H. pylori-positive group (P = 0.001).\\nIn this low-H. pylori prevalence general population, the gastric mucosal microbiota of the normal stomach differed significantly from those with nonatrophic or atrophic gastritis. There was an increasing abundance of pathogenic bacteria from the normal state to early precancerous states. Approximately 15% of all cancers are due to infection. The bacteria Helicobacter pylori is the single leading carcinogenic infectious agent and the main cause of stomach cancer. Prevalence of H. pylori, and, correspondingly, stomach cancer incidence and mortality, is significantly greater among African Americans than whites in the United States. In the present study, we conducted a pilot community-engaged H. pylori education and screening study in partnership with a predominantly African American church in Durham, North Carolina.\\nInitially, we consulted with community advisory boards and convened stakeholder meetings with local community members and primary care physicians. We then developed this pilot study through an iterative collaboration with church partners. Our main outcomes were feasibility and acceptability as measured by participation in a one-day H. pylori screening initiative, and participation in follow-up for those who tested positive. We also sought to determine prevalence and determinants of active H. pylori infection in this population.\\nCommunity engagement informed the event logistics, messaging, educational materials provided, and follow-up plans. A total of 92 individuals participated in the primary study event, 25% of whom had a current H. pylori infection. Of those, 87% returned for the follow-up events, among whom 70% had successfully cleared their infection.\\nThrough community engagement, community-based H. pylori screening and stomach cancer prevention is feasible and acceptable. This is a necessary step in order to move stomach cancer prevention forward to population-based precision H. pylori screening and eradication. Although the first-line therapy for early-stage gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma is the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, the effect of eradication in Helicobacter pylori-negative cases is unclear. In this case report, we describe a surgical option for a case of Barrett\\'s esophageal cancer with concurrent gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma.\\nA 79-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with Barrett\\'s esophageal cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Initially, we performed endoscopic submucosal dissection for Barrett\\'s esophageal cancer. Since residual tumor was observed after the endoscopic submucosal dissection, we performed an esophagectomy with two-field lymph node dissection, which was followed by placement of a gastric conduit via the posterior mediastinal route. He was discharged 14\\u2009days after surgery. Although no additional treatment exists for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, no recurrent disease has been detected to date.\\nAn option to use a portion of the stomach with low-grade malignant mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma as a conduit after esophagectomy was suggested. Treatment for acute abdomen during chemotherapy is frequently difficult because of the complicated status of the patients, and there have been only a few case series summarizing the outcomes of emergent surgery during chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical outcomes of emergency surgery for acute abdomen during chemotherapy and identify predictive factors associated with mortality.\\nWe retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute abdomen within 30-days after anti-cancer drugs administration between 2009 and 2020.\\nThirty patients were identified. The primary malignancies were hematological (n\\xa0=\\xa07), colorectal (n\\xa0=\\xa04), lung (n\\xa0=\\xa04), stomach (n\\xa0=\\xa02), breast (n\\xa0=\\xa02), prostate (n\\xa0=\\xa02) and others (n\\xa0=\\xa05). Fifteen patients were treated with the regimen, including molecular-targeted anti-cancer drugs (Bevacizumab: 8 cases, Rituximab: 4, Ramucirumab: 2, and Gefitinib: 1). Indications for emergency surgery were perforation of the gastrointestinal tract (n\\xa0=\\xa024), appendicitis (n\\xa0=\\xa03), bowel obstruction (n\\xa0=\\xa02), and gallbladder perforation (n\\xa0=\\xa01). Severe morbidity (Clavien-Dindo IIIa or more) occurred in 8 cases (27%), and there were 6 in-hospital deaths (20%). Significant factors related to in-hospital death were age >70 years old (P\\xa0=\\xa00.029), poor performance status (ECOG score 1 or 2) (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0088), and serum albumin level <2.6\\xa0g/dl (P\\xa0=\\xa00.026). The incidence of acute abdomen (odds ratio 5.31, P\\xa0=\\xa00.00017) was significantly higher in the patients receiving anti-VEGF drugs than in those without anti-VEGF drugs.\\nThis study identified three predictive factors associated with in-hospital death after emergency surgery during chemotherapy: an older age, poor performance status, and low serum albumin level. In 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused infections worldwide. However, the correlation between the immune infiltration and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility or severity in cancer patients remains to be fully elucidated. ACE2 expressions in normal tissues, cancers and cell lines were comprehensively assessed. Furthermore, we compared ACE2 expression between cancers and matched normal tissues through Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). In addition, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate the related signaling pathways. Finally, the correlations between ACE2 expression and immune infiltration were investigated via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and GEPIA. We found that ACE2 was predominantly expressed in both adult and fetal tissues from the digestive, urinary and male reproductive tracts; moreover, ACE2 expressions in corresponding cancers were generally higher than that in matched healthy tissues. GSEA showed that various metabolic and immune-related pathways were significantly associated with ACE2 expression across multiple cancer types. Intriguingly, we found that ACE2 expression correlated significantly with immune cell infiltration in both normal and cancer tissues, especially in the stomach and colon. These findings proposed a possible fecal-oral and maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that cancers of the respiratory, digestive or urinary tracts would be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bufothionine had been used for gastric cancer (GC) treatment, and this study managed to uncover the underlying mechanisms.\\nCell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay. Flow cytometry (FCM) and TUNEL assay were used to measure cell apoptosis ratio. Intracellular ROS was measured by DCFH-DA probes. qRT-PCR was used to determine miRNAs levels. Western Blot was performed to probe proteins. Dual-luciferase reporter gene system was employed to validate the binding sites of miR-133a-3p and 3\\'UTR regions of IGF1R mRNA. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the expressions of Ki-67 in mice tumor tissues.\\nBufothionine inhibited cell viability, triggered ER stress and promoted ROS production in GC cells, and both ER stress inhibitor Salburinal (Sal) and ROS scavenger (NAC) abrogated Bufothionine induced GC cell death. Besides, miR-133a-3p was upregulated by Bufothionine, and Bufothionine-induced cell death was enhanced by miR-133a-3p overexpression while alleviated by miR-133a-3p knockdown. Furthermore, miR-133a-3p inactivated PI3K/Akt signal pathway by sponging IGF1R, and Bufothionine inhibited insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and inactivated PI3K/Akt cascade by upregulating miR-133a-3p. Notably, the promoting effects of overexpressed miR-133a-3p on Bufothionine-induced GC cell death were abrogated by overexpressing IGF1R, and aggravated by the PI3K/Akt cascade inhibitor (LY294002).\\nBufothionine promoted GC cell death by triggering miR-133a-3p/IGF1R/PI3K/Akt axis mediated ER stress and ROS production. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome that is characterised by a high prevalence of diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. It is largely caused by inactivating germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDH1, although pathogenic variants in CTNNA1 occur in a minority of families with HDGC. In this Policy Review, we present updated clinical practice guidelines for HDGC from the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC), which recognise the emerging evidence of variability in gastric cancer risk between families with HDGC, the growing capability of endoscopic and histological surveillance in HDGC, and increased experience of managing long-term sequelae of total gastrectomy in young patients. To redress the balance between the accessibility, cost, and acceptance of genetic testing and the increased identification of pathogenic variant carriers, the HDGC genetic testing criteria have been relaxed, mainly through less restrictive age limits. Prophylactic total gastrectomy remains the recommended option for gastric cancer risk management in pathogenic CDH1 variant carriers. However, there is increasing confidence from the IGCLC that endoscopic surveillance in expert centres can be safely offered to patients who wish to postpone surgery, or to those whose risk of developing gastric cancer is not well defined. Accurate survival estimates are important for cancer control planning. Although observed survival estimates are unavailable for many countries, where they are available, wide variations are reported. Understanding the impact of specific treatment and imaging modalities can help decision makers to effectively allocate resources to improve cancer survival in their local context.\\nWe developed a microsimulation model of stage-specific cancer survival in 200 countries and territories for 11 cancers (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, anus, liver, pancreas, lung, breast, cervix uteri, and prostate) comprising 60% of global diagnosed cancer cases. The model accounts for country-specific availability of treatment (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy) and imaging modalities (ultrasound, x-ray, CT, MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT), as well as quality of care. We calibrated the model to reported survival estimates from CONCORD-3 (which reports global trends in cancer survival in 2000-14). We estimated 5-year net survival for diagnosed cancers in each country or territory and estimated potential survival gains from increasing the availability of individual treatment and imaging modalities, and more comprehensive packages of scale-up of these interventions. We report the mean and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all outcomes, calculated as the 2·5 and 97·5 percentiles of the simulation results.\\nThe estimated global 5-year net survival for all 11 cancers combined is 42·6% (95% uncertainty interval 40·3-44·3), with survival in high-income countries being an average of 12 times (range 4-17) higher than that in low-income countries. Expanding availability of surgery or radiotherapy or improving quality of care would yield the largest survival gains in low-income (2·5-3·4 percentage point increase in survival) and lower-middle-income countries (2·4-6·1 percentage point increase), whereas upper-middle-income and high-income countries are more likely to benefit from improved availability of targeted therapy (0·7 percentage point increase for upper-middle income and 0·4 percentage point increase for high income). Investing in medical imaging will also be necessary to achieve substantial survival gains, with traditional modalities estimated to provide the largest gains in low-income settings, while MRI and PET would yield the largest gains in higher-income countries. Simultaneous expansion of treatment, imaging, and quality of care could improve 5-year net survival by more than ten times in low-income countries (3·8% [95% UI 0·5-9·2] to 45·2% [40·2-52·1]) and could more than double 5-year net survival in lower-middle-income countries (20·1% [7·2-31·7] to 47·1% [42·8-50·8]).\\nScaling up both treatment and imaging availability could yield synergistic survival gains for patients with cancer. Expanding traditional modalities in lower-income settings might be a feasible pathway to improve survival before scaling up more modern technologies.\\nHarvard T H Chan School of Public Health. Gastric cancer usually spread via blood circulation to liver, lung, bone, and kidney after recurrence, but it is extremely rare in clinical practice that gastric carcinoma metastasizes to the skin and colon without metastasis to common sites like liver or lung.\\nA 57-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with altered bowel habit and hematochezia for 2 weeks.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer at stage IIIA (pT3N2M0) two and a half years ago. Cutaneous metastasis from gastric cancer was confirmed by cutaneous biopsy 2 years following curative gastrectomy. Unfortunately, colonic metastasis from gastric cancer was found by PET-CT 6 months after the diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis.\\nThe patient was given chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil for the skin metastasis. Right hemicolectomy was performed when the malignant tumor of the colon was found, in order to relieve the symptom, and improve the quality of life.\\nThe patient was treated with chemoradiotherapy in a local hospital, the peritoneal carcinomatosis occurred 5 months after the second operation, and died 9 months after the diagnosis of colonic metastasis.\\nOur case represents a rare condition that solitary cutaneous and colonic metastasis from gastric cancer can occur after surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy. Its unique clinicopathological features can extend our insights on gastric cancer, and it may provide clinicians with some positive clinical experience for identifying and treating this disease. Although many studies in China have found that environmental or lifestyle factors are major contributors to the etiology of esophageal cancer, most of the patients in the above studies are in the middle and late stages, the early-stage patients account for a small proportion. To clarify the risk/protective factors contributing to early lesions, we conducted the present cross-sectional study.A total of 2925 healthy controls and 402 patients with esophageal precancerous lesions were included in our study by endoscopic examination. Information on risk/protective factors was collected by personal interview, and unconditional logistic regression was used to determine adjusted odds ratios (AORs) by the maximum-likelihood method.Smoking >20 pack-years (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a1.48), duration of drinking >30 years (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a1.40), alcohol consumption >100\\u200amL/d (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a1.44), gastroesophageal reflux disease (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a1.75), esophagitis (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a1.25), a family history of esophageal cancer (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a1.92), or stomach cancer (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a1.92) were significant risk factors for esophageal precancerous lesions. There was a negative correlation between abdominal obesity and early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a0.75). In addition, we found that there was a synergistic effect between a family history of esophageal cancer and drinking (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a3.00) and smoking (AOR\\u200a=\\u200a2.90).Lifestyle risk factors, genetic factors, and upper gastrointestinal diseases are associated with the development of esophageal precancerous lesions. These results highlight the need for primary prevention to reduce the future burden of cancer and other chronic diseases in high-risk areas of rural China. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gradually drawn the attention of clinicians as an alternative for Primary Liver Cancer (PLC), is based on the theory of syndrome differentiation. However, owing to the lack of evidence-based medical evidence, the authors designed this protocol to evaluate TCM\\'s effectiveness and safety.\\nSeven electronic databases will be searched from inception to Aug. 2020. Two of us will independently identify randomized controlled trials, extract the data and assess the risk of bias. The meta-analysis will be conducted with the Review Manager 5.3 software according the heterogeneity of eligible studies. Further, we will use the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation to evaluate the evidence quality.\\nThis study will demonstrate an evidence-based review of TCM for PLC.\\nThe study will provide clear evidence to assess the effectiveness and side effects of TCM for PLC.\\nPROSPERO CRD 42020173748. This case series aimed to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in patients with lung, renal, gastric, and other non-liver cancers.Twenty-four patients who underwent DEB-TACE or DEB-TACE combined with other therapies were reviewed in this case series. Treatment responses were assessed at 1 month after treatment according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Overall survival (OS) and adverse events were recorded.In the total patients, the objective response and disease control rate were 79.2% and 87.5%, respectively. And the mean OS in total patients was 14.7 months (95% confidence interval: 9.6-19.9 months). The number of patients who had generalized aches, nausea, vomit, fever, abdominal discomfort, chest discomfort, elevated blood pressure, cough, loss of appetite, and headache in total patients were 7 (29.2%), 11 (45.8%), 6 (25.0%), 2 (8.3%), 3 (12.5%), 3 (12.5%), 1 (4.2%), 1 (4.2%), 1 (4.2%), and 1 (4.2%), respectively. The objective response rates in patients with lung, renal, gastric, and other non-liver cancer were 70.0%, 85.7%, 100.0%, and 80.0%, respectively. In patients with lung, renal, gastric, and other non-liver cancers, the mean values of the OSs were 13.4 months, 12.4 months, 7.6 months, and 20.3 months, respectively. And the most common adverse events in lung cancer patients, renal carcinoma patients, gastric cancer patients, and patients with other non-liver cancers were post-embolization syndrome.DEB-TACE may be an effective and safe therapeutic option in patients with lung, renal, gastric, and other non-liver cancers.  Platinum, a transition metal that is widely used in anti-cancer agents, also results in the development of nephropathy due to severe adverse reactions caused by platinum-induced nephrotoxicity. Reports on imaging with metals other than platinum remain are limited, even in preclinical studies. Furthermore, most of these are case reports, and the relationship between the distribution of the metal and clinical observations in human samples is not well understood. Here we report on visualizing lanthanum ( Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several susceptibility loci for gastric cancer (GC), but the majority of identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fall within the non-coding region and are likely to exert their biological function by modulating gene expression. To systematically estimate expression-associated SNPs (eSNPs) that confer genetic predisposition to GC, we evaluated the associations of 314,203 stomach tissue-specific eSNPs with GC risk in three GWAS datasets (2,631 cases and 4,373 controls). Subsequently, we conducted a gene-based analysis to calculate the cumulative effect of eSNPs through sequence kernel association combined test and Sherlock integrative analysis. At the SNP-level, we identified two novel variants (rs836545 at 7p22.1 and rs1892252 at 6p22.2) associated with GC risk. The risk allele carriers of rs836545-T and rs1892252-G exhibited higher expression levels of  Our study aimed to evaluate the benefits of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) after D2 gastrectomy, as compared to adjuvant chemotherapy, alone. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched. We applied stepwise analyses that enabled the evaluation of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), balanced studies, and all studies separately and in a hierarchical manner. Thirteen controlled studies, including six RCTs involving 2603 patients, were included. Overall pooled analysis revealed a disease-free survival benefit of CRT (odds ratio (OR): 1.264,  Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) is the most common histological type of gastric cancer, the fifth according to the frequency and the third among the deadliest cancers. GAC high mortality is due to a combination of factors, such as silent evolution, late clinical presentation, underlying genetic heterogeneity, and effective mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOCs) that make the available antitumor drugs scarcely useful. MOCs include reduced drug uptake (MOC-1a), enhanced drug efflux (MOC-1b), low proportion of active agents in tumor cells due to impaired pro-drug activation or active drug inactivation (MOC-2), changes in molecular targets sensitive to anticancer drugs (MOC-3), enhanced ability of cancer cells to repair drug-induced DNA damage (MOC-4), decreased function of pro-apoptotic factors versus up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes (MOC-5), changes in tumor cell microenvironment altering the response to anticancer agents (MOC-6), and phenotypic transformations, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the appearance of stemness characteristics (MOC-7). This review summarizes updated information regarding the molecular bases accounting for these mechanisms and their impact on the lack of clinical response to the pharmacological treatment currently used in GAC. This knowledge is required to identify novel biomarkers to predict treatment failure and druggable targets, and to develop sensitizing strategies to overcome drug refractoriness in GAC. In this study, we assessed the presence of  High-throughput molecular profiling of solid tumours using core needle biopsies (CNB) allows the identification of actionable molecular alterations, with around 70% success rate. Although several studies have demonstrated the utility of small biopsy specimens for molecular testing, there remains debate as to the sensitivity of the less invasive fine-needle aspiration (FNA) compared to CNB to detect molecular alterations. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the potential of FNA to detect such alterations in various tumour types as compared to CNB in cancer patients included in the SHIVA02 trial. An in-house amplicon-based targeted sequencing panel (Illumina TSCA 99.3\\xa0kb panel covering 87 genes) was used to identify pathogenic variants and gene copy number variations (CNV) in concomitant CNB and FNA samples obtained from 61 patients enrolled in the SHIVA02 trial (NCT03084757). The main tumour types analysed were breast (38%), colon (15%), pancreas (11%), followed by cervix and stomach (7% each). We report 123 molecular alterations (85 variants, 23 amplifications and 15 homozygous deletions) among which 98 (80%) were concordant between CNB and FNA. The remaining discordances were mainly related to deletions status, yet undetected alterations were not exclusively specific to FNA. Comparative analysis of molecular alterations in CNB and FNA showed high concordance in terms of variants as well as CNVs identified. We conclude FNA could therefore be used in routine diagnostics workflow and clinical trials for tumour molecular profiling with the advantages of being minimally invasive and preserve tissue material needed for diagnostic, prognostic or theranostic purposes. There are currently no reports on the application of three-dimensional (3D) vision to single-incision laparoscopic surgery. This study compared 3D vision to the previous two-dimensional (2D) system in single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (SIDG).\\nMedical charts of 179 gastric cancer patients who underwent SIDG from February 2014 to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped into either a 2D group or 3D group depending on the type of camera that was used. All operations were performed using a flexible camera (Olympus, Japan). Operative data and postoperative outcome were analyzed.\\nThere were 90 patients in the 2D group and 89 patients in the 3D group. No differences were found in terms of the age, body mass index, staging, and other demographics of the patients. Operative time was significantly faster in the 3D group (115.6\\u2009±\\u200934.0 vs. 129.4\\u2009±\\u200938.5\\xa0min, p\\u2009=\\u20090.012), and estimated blood loss (EBL) was less in the 3D group (20.7\\u2009±\\u200930.0 vs. 35.1\\u2009±\\u200956.0\\xa0ml, p\\u2009=\\u20090.034). Patients in the 3D group were able to start a small fluid diet earlier (2.5, range 1-6 vs. 3.0, range 2-8 postoperative days, p\\u2009=\\u20090.006) and were discharged faster (5.4, range 3-12 vs. 6.2, range 4-24 postoperative days, p\\u2009=\\u20090.024). There was no statistical difference between early and late complications.\\nThe use of the 3D camera shortened operative time with possible clinical benefits for patients undergoing SIDG.  宫颈胃型腺性病变是一种以表达胃型黏液为特点，形态学上类似于幽门腺上皮的谱系病变，包括良性病变、癌前病变和癌。该文从病理形态学、分子遗传学、治疗及预后等多方面对该谱系病变分析总结，以期对该谱系病变有更深度的认识，为进一步开展研究奠定基础。. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular biomarkers that are pivotal for the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). We analyzed clinical specimens using RNA sequencing to identify the target genes. We found that the expression of HOXC6 mRNA was upregulated with the progression of cancer, which was validated by quantitative real time PCR and RNA in-situ hybridization. To compare the protein expression of HOXC6, we evaluated GC and normal gastric tissue samples using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. We detected significantly higher levels of HOXC6 in the GC tissues than in the normal controls at both mRNA and protein levels. The expression levels of HOXC6 mRNA in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) were significantly higher than those in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that high expression of HOXC6 mRNA is significantly associated with poor clinical prognosis. Our findings suggest that HOXC6 mRNA may be a novel biomarker and can be potentially valuable in predicting the prognosis of GC patients. Especially, HOXC6 mRNA in-situ hybridization may be a diagnostic tool for predicting prognosis of individual GC patients. Single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 (SSBP2) is ubiquitously expressed, with several studies reporting it to be a tumor suppressor. We investigated SSBP2 expression and its clinicopathological significance in gastric cancer. SSBP2 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 539 gastric cancer sections. The cases were divided into three subtypes, namely, Epstein-Barr virus-associated (EBV), microsatellite unstable, and others (microsatellite stable and EBV negative), based on the molecular classification of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cases were also divided into two subgroups according to the amplification status of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Most cases showed SSBP2 positivity, and only 24 (4.5%) cases displayed negative nuclear expression. Loss of nuclear expression correlated significantly with high pT category (P = 0.001), nodal metastasis (P = 0.002), and stage of progression (P = 0.005), with no correlation between molecular characteristics and SSBP2 expression. All HER2 amplification cases displayed positive SSBP2 expression. Negative SSBP2 cases showed significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to positive SSBP2 cases (P = 0.008). Loss of nuclear expression of SSBP2 was significantly associated with shorter RFS in the microsatellite stable and EBV negative groups (P = 0.002), as well as the HER2 negative group (P = 0.007). However, there were no statistically significant differences in multivariate analyses. Loss of nuclear expression of SSBP2 was a poor prognostic factor, associated with stage of progression and recurrence, and showed no significant difference in molecular characteristics, including TCGA subtype and HER2 status. Aprepitant is a selective SP/NK-1 receptor antagonist and used in postoperative and chemotherapeutics induced emesis and vomiting. The aim of our study is to show aprepitant may have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal complaints in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapeutics by indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer model. A total of 48 rats were fasted 24\\xa0h for ulcer experiment. Aprepitant doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40\\xa0mg/kg were evaluated for their antiulcer activity. Omeprazole (20\\xa0mg/kg) was used as a positive control group. Six hours after 25\\xa0mg/kg indomethacin administration, all stomachs were dissected out. After macroscopic analyses, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), COX-1, and COX-2 mRNA levels and SOD activity, and GSH and MDA levels of stomachs were determined. Histopathological examinations were evaluated. Aprepitant administration exerted 48.14%, 49.62%, 65.92%, and 76.77% ulcer inhibition effects at 5, 10, 20, and 40\\xa0mg/kg, respectively. Aprepitant administration decreased oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters in stomach tissues dose dependently. Aprepitant administration increased stomach COX-2 mRNA levels at 20 and 40\\xa0mg/kg doses. Although aprepitant appears to be disadvantageous in terms of treating gastric ulcer due to COX enzyme inhibition according to the previous studies, aprepitant has been shown to have ulcer healing effect in our study. When aprepitant is given as an anti-nausea and vomiting drug to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, we can argue that it will not be necessary to add a new gastric protective agent as it also shows beneficial effects in gastrointestinal complaints.  Approximately 17%-40% of para-aortic lymph node (PAN) metastasis occurs in patients with advanced gastric cancer. As the third tier of lymphatic drainage of the stomach and the final station in front of the systemic circulation, PAN infiltration is defined as distant metastasis and plays a key role in the evaluation of the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer. Many clinical factors including tumor size ≥ 5 cm, pT3 or pT4 depth of tumor invasion, pN2 and pN3 stages, the macroscopic type of Borrmann III/IV, and the diffuse/mixed Lauren classification are indicators of PAN metastasis. Whether PAN dissection (PAND) should be performed on patients with or without the macroscopic PAN invasion remains unascertained, regardless of the numerous retrospective comparative studies reported on the improved prognosis over D2 alone. Another paradoxical result from many other studies showed no significant difference in the overall survival between these two lymphadenectomies. A phase II trial launched by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group indicated that two or three courses of S-1 and cisplatin preoperatively followed by radical surgery with D2 + PAND and postoperative S-1 is the current standard strategy for the treatment of patients with extensive lymph node metastasis, and this regimen could be substituted by a promising strategy with effective combination chemotherapy or suitable chemotherapy duration. This review focuses on the advances in radical gastrectomy plus PAND with or without chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Digestive organ cancer is a major public health issue both in Asia and in Mongolia. The most prevalent cancer-related deaths in Mongolia are registered as caused by the stomach, esophagus, and liver. There is a lack of study which investigated the accurate incidence of digestive organ cancer nationwide.\\nWe aimed to investigate the incidence of stomach and esophageal cancers in Mongolian population.\\nEpidemiologic data were collected between 2009 and 2018 through the oncology departments of hospitals and medical centers in all provinces, soums (the smallest unit of provinces), and major districts of the capital city. We used appropriate statistical methods in SPSS software.\\nThe incidence of esophageal cancer in last 10 years (2009-2018) was 10.09 in 100,000 populations and the highest incidence was registered in Uvs (38.13), Bayan-Ulgii (24.15), and Zavkhan (18.18) provinces, respectively. The incidence of stomach cancer was 20.33 in 100,000 populations and the highest incidences were registered in Uvs (53.01), Khovd (46.02), and Darkhan-Uul (40.50) provinces, respectively.\\nThe incidences of these cancers have increased last 10 years in some provinces. Stomach and esophageal cancers incidence in Mongolia is considerably higher compared to the other Asian countries. The nationwide targeted prevention program is needed.\\nLonjid T, Sambuu T, Tumurbat N,   The risk of gastric cancer increases in patients with \\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of stomach regions that are automatically estimated by a deep learning-based model for CAG detection.\\nWe used 815 gastric X-ray images (GXIs) obtained from 815 subjects. The ground truth of this study was the diagnostic results in X-ray and endoscopic examinations. For a part of GXIs for training, the stomach regions are manually annotated. A model for automatic estimation of the stomach regions is trained with the GXIs. For the rest of them, the stomach regions are automatically estimated. Finally, a model for automatic CAG detection is trained with all GXIs for training.\\nIn the case that the stomach regions were manually annotated for only 10 GXIs and 30 GXIs, the harmonic mean of sensitivity and specificity of CAG detection were 0.955 ± 0.002 and 0.963 ± 0.004, respectively.\\nBy estimating stomach regions automatically, our method contributes to the reduction of the workload of manual annotation and the accurate detection of the CAG. Cancer patients often suffer from severe pain related to bone metastasis. We encountered a patient in whom the addition of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for persistent pain related to bone metastasis during therapy with opioids and oral NSAIDs reduced pain, improving activities of daily living (ADL). Fentanyl patches, celecoxib, denosumab, and topical NSAIDs (loxoprofen tape, felbinac) were administered to a 72-year-old patient with gastric cancer and pain related to bone metastasis. Pain control was favorable, with a numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 2 and Japanese version Support Team Assessment Schedule (STAS-J) score of 1. Intervention by pharmacists for the use of topical NSAIDs decreased both the NRS and STAS-J scores to zero, improving ADL. The results suggest that topical NSAIDs relieve bone-metastasis-related pain, improving ADL. When bone-metastasis-related pain is localized, the prescription of topical NSAIDs should be considered, and positive intervention by pharmacists regarding their usage should be promoted. The aim of the study was to analyse years of life lost due to selected malignant neoplasms of the digestive system (colorectum, stomach, and pancreas) in Poland, a post-communist country in Central Europe, according to socioeconomic variables: sex, age, level of education, marital status, working status, and place of residence. The study included a dataset comprising death certificates of Polish citizens from 2002 (N = 359\\u2009486) and 2011 (N = 375\\u2009501). The data on deaths caused by malignant neoplasms of the digestive system, that is, coded as C15-C26 according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, was analyzed. The standard expected years of life lost meter was used to calculate years of life lost. In 2002, malignant neoplasms of the digestive system caused 25\\u2009024 deaths among Polish citizens (7.0% of all deaths), which translated into a premature loss of 494\\u2009442.1 years of life (129.4 years per 10\\u2009000 people). In 2011, the number of deaths increased to 26\\u2009537 (7.1% of all deaths) and the number of years of life lost rose to 499\\u2009804.0 (129.7 years per 10\\u2009000). The most important causes of mortality and years of life lost were colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers. In both studied years, the socioeconomic features with an adverse effect on years of life lost due to each considered malignant neoplasm of the digestive system included male gender, lower than secondary education, widowed marital status, economic inactivity, living in urban areas. Years of life lost analysis constitutes a valuable part of epidemiological assessment of health inequalities in society. It appears that the observed inequalities may have many causes; however, further research is needed to better understand their full extent. Cancer mortality has declined over the last three decades in most high-income countries reflecting improvements in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and management. However, there are persisting and substantial differences in mortality, incidence, and survival worldwide. In order to provide an up-to-date overview of trends in mortality, incidence, and survival, we retrieved data from high-quality, population-based cancer registries for all cancers and 10 selected cancer sites in six high-income countries and the European Union. We computed age-standardized (world standard population) mortality and incidence rates, and applied joinpoint regression models. Mortality from all cancers and most common cancer sites has declined over the last 25\\u2009years, except for the pancreas and lung (in women). The patterns for incidence are less consistent between countries, except for a steady decrease in stomach cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in men. Survival for all cancers and the selected cancer sites increased in all countries, even if there is still a substantial variability. Although overall cancer death rates continue to decline, incidence rates have been levelling off among men and have been moderately increasing among women. These trends reflect changes in cancer risk factors, screening test use, diagnostic practices, and treatment advances. Many cancers can be prevented or treated effectively if they are diagnosed early. Population-based cancer incidence and mortality data can be used to focus efforts to decrease the cancer burden and regularly monitor progress towards cancer control goals. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations have higher gastric cancer rates than the general US population. This study provides a comprehensive overview of incidence rates among AI/AN persons during 2005-2016 compared with non-Hispanic whites (whites).\\nPopulation-based cancer registry data for 2005-2016 were linked with the Indian Health Service patient registration databases to address racial misclassification. Age-adjusted gastric cancer incidence rates were expressed per 100,000 per year. Incidence and trend analyses were restricted to purchased/referred care delivery area counties in 6 geographic regions, comparing gastric cancer incidence rates for AI/AN vs white populations in the United States.\\nGastric cancer rates were higher in the AI/AN compared with white populations in nearly every US region. Incidence rates for central/distal portions of the stomach were higher in AI/AN individuals compared with whites. Rates of later stage gastric cancer were higher in AI/AN populations overall and in every region except the Pacific Coast and East. Incidence rates decreased significantly over time in both populations. Declining rates in the AI/AN populations were driven by changes in the Pacific Coast and Northern Plains regions.\\nAI/AN populations have a disproportionately high incidence of gastric cancer, especially in Alaska. High incidence in the central/distal portions of the stomach among AI/AN populations likely reflects a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in these populations. These data can be used to develop interventions to reduce risk factors and improve access to health services among AI/AN people at high risk for gastric cancer. None Gastric adenocarcinomas with low grade atypia may be difficult to diagnose as gastric cancer by preoperative biopsy. We report an extremely well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (EWDA) of the stomach which appeared like a submucosal tumor diagnosed by preoperative endoscopic submucosal dissection.\\nA 70-year-old male was referred with a 3-month history of a submucosal-appearing lesion in the gastric wall found on endoscopy. Biopsies of the lesion were performed and were inconclusive for neoplasia. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a low echoic tumor growing into the fourth layer of the gastric wall. It was difficult to identify the tumor by repeat biopsy. Endoscopic submucosal dissection of the lesion was performed and revealed adenocarcinoma, and laparoscopic total gastrectomy was performed. Histopathologic evaluation showed that the tumor was stage IIA (T3N0M0). There is no recurrence 12 months after resection.\\nGastric EWDAs are rare lesions, accounting for 0.6% of all gastric cancers. It is difficult to diagnose gastric EWDA especially if it appears like a submucosal tumor. This lesion was finally diagnosed by endoscopic submucosal dissection.\\nEndoscopic submucosal dissection may facilitate establishing the preoperative diagnosis of a tumor thought to be a gastric EWDA based on its endoscopic appearance and pathological findings. We seek to determine whether laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (LS-HIPEC) improves overall survival (OS) in patients with gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma and low-volume peritoneal metastasis compared with standard of care treatment.\\nWe reviewed data from a prospectively maintained database of patients with gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma to identify patients with radiologically occult carcinomatosis or positive peritoneal cytology, no evidence of distant metastasis, and without disease progression during initial chemotherapy or observation. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of LS-HIPEC on OS.\\nWe identified 25 patients who underwent LS-HIPEC and 27 treated with a standard of care approach due to patient (33.3%) or provider (51.9%) preference or financial limitations/lack of insurance coverage (14.8%). Resection was ultimately performed in 28% of LS-HIPEC patients and no standard care patients. At a median follow-up of 18.9\\xa0months, median OS was 24.7 (IQR 20.8-34.2) months in LS-HIPEC patients and 21.3 (IQR 12.3-23.1) months in standard care patients (p\\u2009=\\u20090.08). Three-year OS in the LS-HIPEC group was 19.1%, compared with 9.6% (p\\u2009=\\u20090.08). Patients who underwent resection had a median OS of 25.3 (IQR 22.6-47.1) months compared with 21.3\\xa0months in standard care patients (p\\u2009=\\u20090.05).\\nNeoadjuvant LS-HIPEC for the treatment of low-volume peritoneal disease in gastric and gastroesophageal cancer patients did not significantly improve OS compared with standard care. Multiinstitutional studies are necessary to further elucidate the benefit of LS-HIPEC for this patient population. None The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased in patients with cancer and is greatest in those with cancers of the pancreas, stomach, brain, lung and ovary, late stage disease and in those undergoing treatment including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or surgery. VTE in patients with cancer is associated with a variety of adverse consequences including an increased risk of VTE recurrence, major bleeding, and early mortality. A VTE risk score for ambulatory patients receiving cancer chemotherapy has been extensively validated and has been used to select high risk patients for thromboprophylaxis trials. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of these trials have confirmed that LMWHs can significantly reduce the risk of VTE in patients with cancer. While the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved for the general population, previous guideline panels discouraged their use due to a lack of cancer-specific data. Recently RCTs for the treatment of established VTE in patients with cancer have demonstrated that the risk of recurrent VTE is lower while the risk of bleeding greater with DOACs compared to LMWH. Two thromboprophylaxis trials comparing low dose DOACs to placebo in high risk patients receiving cancer therapy have recently reported similar rates of VTE occurrence at 6 months in the control arms. A meta-analysis of the pooled results from these trials in higher risk ambulatory patients receiving cancer therapy confirmed a significant reduction in overall VTE incidence as well as pre-planned secondary outcomes on treatment. Several clinical practice guidelines addressing VTE in patients with malignant disease have been updated including those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The addition of DOACs as an option for the management of VTE in patients with cancer is the latest major change to previous guidelines issued by these organizations. The updated recommendations from these guidelines are summarized in this review. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major health concern worldwide. Due to the lack of specific medication and vaccination, drug-repurposing attempts has emerged as a promising approach and identified several human proteins interacting with the virus. This study aims to provide a comprehensive molecular profiling of the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13.\\nThe list of immune cell-enriched proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from The Human Protein Atlas. Genomic alterations were identified using cBioPortal. Survival analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Analyses of protein expression and tumor infiltration levels were carried out by TIMER.\\n14 human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 were enriched in immune cells. Among these proteins, USP13 had the highest frequency of genomic alterations. Higher USP13 levels were correlated with improved survival in breast and lung cancers, while resulting in poor prognosis in ovarian and gastric cancers. Furthermore, copy number variations of USP13 significantly affected the infiltration levels of distinct subtypes of immune cells in head & neck, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers. Although our results suggested a tumor suppressor role for USP13 in lung cancer, in other cancers, its role seemed to be context-dependent.\\nIt is critical to identify and characterize human proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 in order to have a better understanding of the disease and to develop better therapies/vaccines. Here, we provided a comprehensive molecular profiling the immune cell-enriched SARS-CoV-2 interacting protein USP13, which will be useful for future studies. Second-line treatments boost overall survival in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). However, there is a paucity of information as to patterns of use and the results achieved in actual clinical practice.\\nThe study population comprised patients with AGC in the AGAMENON registry who had received second-line. The objective was to describe the pattern of second-line therapies administered, progression-free survival following second-line (PFS-2), and post-progression survival since first-line (PPS).\\n2311 cases with 2066 progression events since first-line (89.3%) were recorded; 245 (10.6%) patients died during first-line treatment and 1326/2066 (64.1%) received a second-line. Median PFS-2 and PPS were 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9-3.3) and 5.8 months (5.5-6.3), respectively. The most widely used strategies were monoCT (56.9%), polyCT (15.0%), ramucirumab+CT (12.6%), platinum-reintroduction (8.3%), trastuzumab+CT (6.1%), and ramucirumab (1.1%). PFS-2/PPS medians gradually increased in monoCT, 2.6/5.1 months; polyCT 3.4/6.3 months; ramucirumab+CT, 4.1/6.5 months; platinum-reintroduction, 4.2/6.7 months, and for the HER2+ subgroup in particular, trastuzumab+CT, 5.2/11.7 months. Correlation between PFS since first-line and OS was moderate in the series as a whole (Kendall\\'s τ = 0.613), lower in those subjects who received second-line (Kendall\\'s τ = 0.539), especially with ramucirumab+CT (Kendall\\'s τ = 0.413).\\nThis analysis reveals the diversity in second-line treatment for AGC, highlighting the effectiveness of paclitaxel-ramucirumab and, for a selected subgroup of patients, platinum reintroduction; both strategies endorsed by recent clinical guidelines. This case presents an unusually late complication of oesophagectomy 20-years post-surgery, with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation revealed a gastric conduit ulcer eroding into the lower lobe of the right lung, forming a fistula with a basal branch of the right pulmonary artery. Upon successful embolisation, the HydroCoil Ross syndrome (RS) is a rare peripheral autonomic system disorder characterized by tonic pupil, hyporeflexia, and segmental anhidrosis. Neuropathological studies show that RS results from the selective cholinergic nerve degeneration. However, the cause and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show α-synuclein accumulation in the autonomic nerve terminals in the lesser curvature of stomach of patients with RS. In addition, immunohistochemical findings demonstrate that a dominant degeneration of cholinergic fibers is exhibited in patients with RS, while main degeneration of adrenergic fibers is demonstrated in patients with pure autonomic failure in their gastrointestinal and urinary system. Our study suggests that RS belongs to α-synucleinopathies. Moreover, our findings indicate that adrenergic nerves and cholinergic nerves are not equally damaged in different types of pure autonomic dysfunctions. Glomus tumors are very uncommon neoplasms arising from glomus bodies. They differ in the proportion of components, i.e. smooth muscle tissue, vessels and glomus cells. The most common location of this kind of tumor is the subungual area of digits. In other locations, glomus tumors are very rare but have been reported, among others, in bone, lungs, trachea and stomach. Glomus tumors are often misdiagnosed because of diverse clinical presentations. They can be asymptomatic, may lead to cosmetic discomfort, but clinical presentation often involves pain, tenderness and cold hypersensitivity. We present a case of multiple glomus tumor in the foot of a 41-year-old woman. After several surgical consultations, she had been referred for further surgery including possible ampu-tation, which she declined. Simultaneous multiple excisions of the tumors resulted in complete symptomatic relief. This case confirms that glomus tumors should be considered in a patient with multiple lesions producing ex-cruciating pain. This retrospective study aimed to better define the characteristics and outcomes of extranodal stage I DLBCL in the rituximab era. Patients diagnosed with stage I DLBCL from 2001-2015 treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP) or R-CHOP-like regimens with or without radiation (RT) were included. We identified 1955 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, of whom 341 had stage I and were eligible for this analysis. Extranodal presentation was observed in 224 (66%) patients, while 117 (34%) had nodal involvement. The most common extranodal sites were bone 21%; stomach 19%; testis 9%; intestine 8%; breast 8%. Overall, 69% extranodal and 68% nodal patients received RT. Median follow-up was 5.5 years (interquartile range 4.3-8.2). 10-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were 77% (95% CI 67%, 83%) and 77% (95% CI 68%, 85%). In the multivariable analyses, extranodal involvement was associated with worse OS (HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.05, 11.30) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 3.25, 95% CI 1.08, 9.72) compared to nodal. Consolidation RT was associated with better OS (HR, 0.26, 95% CI 0.12, 0.49) and PFS (HR, 0.35, 95% CI 0.18, 0.69) in the extranodal population; however, the benefit was no longer observed in patients with PET negative at the end of immunochemotherapy. Relapses occurred usually late (median 37 months) and the most common sites were the lymph nodes (31%) and the central nervous system (27%). Extranodal stage I DLBCL had a worse outcome than nodal. End of immunochemotherapy PET results may help select extranodal patients for consolidation RT. Altered connexin expression has been associated with cancer development and progression. This study evaluated connexin 26, 32, and 43 expression in association with the long-term outcomes of gastric cancer after gastrectomy.\\nPathological specimens were collected from 113 patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer, of whom 104 were included in the study. The expression levels of the connexins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The patients were classified into low and high groups according to the median histoscore of connexin.\\nCancer-specific survival (CSS) was significantly longer in the high than low connexin 43 group (p=0.030), particularly in patients >65 years old (p=0.030). A multivariate analysis identified pathological stage, differentiation type, and connexin 43 expression as possible predictors of CSS in patients (difference in the area under the curve=0.232, 0.090, and 0.094).\\nLow connexin 43 expression predicted a poor CSS in gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is often depleted in patients with gastric cancer undergoing gastrectomy. Using a novel method, we evaluated the effect of SMM depletion after gastrectomy on disease prognosis.\\nThe maximum cross-sectional area of the psoas-muscle (MCA-PM) was measured before surgery and at 1 year after in 233 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy to determine the ratio (MCA-PMR) as an indicator of SMM depletion.\\nThe MCA-PMR cutoff value was set at 90%, and patients were divided into the groups with <90% and ≥90%. MCA-PMR <90% was an independent prognostic factor for all patients. In 88 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy including S-1, the 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was significantly better for those with MCA-PMR ≥90% than for those with MCA-PMR <90% (84.1% vs. 59.1%; p=0.010; hazard ratio=2.974; 95% confidence interval=1.241-7.124).\\nSMM depletion after gastrectomy can be measured using the MCA-PMR. This novel measurement can be easily implemented in the clinical setting. Gastric cancer develops even in Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori)-uninfected patients and its typical histological feature is signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) within the mucosal layer. However, the biological characteristics of SRCC remain unclear. We aimed to clarify the pathological and genetic features of SRCC in H. pylori-uninfected patients.\\nSeventeen H. pylori-uninfected patients with mucosal SRCCs were enrolled and their clinicopathological characteristics were compared with those of H. pylori-infected patients with mucosal SRCCs. Seven SRCCs without H. pylori-infected, including two invasive SRCCs, and seven H. pylori-infected SRCCs were subjected to a genetic analysis using next-generation sequencing.\\nH. pylori-uninfected patients with mucosal SRCCs revealed male dominancy and a significantly higher prevalence of smokers among them as compared with the H. pylori-infected patients with SRCC. A CDH1 mutation (frame shift indel) was detected in one H. pylori-uninfected cancer not only in the mucosal SRCC but also in the invasive portion. A TP53 mutation was detected in one SRCC without H. pylori-infected. In the control group, ARID1A and TP53 mutations were detected in one SRCC each. The C to A mutation, which is a characteristic smoking-induced mutation, was not found in any of the samples.\\nSome SRCCs in H. pylori-uninfected patients may have a malignant potential similar to that of SRCCs in H. pylori-infected patients. Smoking may not be the main carcinogenic factor for the development of SRCCs among the H. pylori-uninfected patients.  Diet quality among short- and long-term gastrointestinal (GI) cancer survivors with different tumor sites was investigated compared to a reference population cohort. Diet quality of GI cancer survivors ( In advanced gastric cancer, chemotherapy, given either perioperatively or as an adjuvant treatment, has been shown to improve survival when compared to surgery alone. However, no trial has compared these two approaches head-to-head. Hence, we aimed to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of patients with gastric cancer who received either perioperative chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nRetrospective analysis of patients with gastric cancers treated from 2010 to 2016. Using propensity score matching, resected patients who received perioperative chemotherapy were matched for histology, nodal dissection, and extent of surgery with another cohort of patients who received only adjuvant chemotherapy to create two matched groups of 101 patients each-group A (perioperative) and group B (adjuvant)-and the outcomes were compared between them.\\nThe patient demographics were evenly distributed in the two groups. There was no difference in the median number of chemotherapy cycles delivered (6\\xa0vs 6, P\\xa0=\\xa0.8) or the grade 3-4 toxicity (17.2%\\xa0vs 12.1%, P\\xa0=\\xa0.26) in group A and group B, respectively. We could not demonstrate a significant difference in the postoperative mortality (2.6%\\xa0vs 0%) or overall postoperative complications (23%\\xa0vs 19%) between groups A and B. The overall recurrence rate (37%\\xa0vs 42%), 3-year disease-free survival rate (51%\\xa0vs 48%), and 3-year overall survival rate (53%\\xa0vs 55%) were not significantly different in group A and group B, respectively.\\nWe were unable to detect a significant difference in the short-term or long-term outcomes of patients with gastric cancer undergoing either perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy. The objective of this retrospective, single-institution study was to assess the safety and feasibility of reconstruction using subtotal stomach (SS) with esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer (EC). Although several different gastric-tube-making and anastomotic methods have been reported, the incidence rate of anastomotic leakage with EC surgery is generally reported over 10%. Complications should be avoided, and patient quality of life (QOL) should be maintained postoperatively. We have used SS reconstruction and hand-sutured cervical esophagus-subtotal gastric anastomosis at the neck wound in EC surgery. Short- and long-term outcomes in cases using SS are not well known.\\nBetween January 2008 and September 2019, 300 patients underwent esophagectomy for EC and reconstruction using SS. The primary endpoint was the rate of anastomotic leakage. Secondary endpoints were postoperative morbidities, QOL, and changes in patients\\' body weight and skeletal muscle weight.\\nAnastomotic leakage was observed in two patients (0.67%), and pneumonia was observed in nine patients (3.0%). Fifteen patients (5.0%) had an anastomotic stenosis requiring a bougie. Nausea occurred in 11 patients (3.7%), and dumping syndrome occurred in seven patients (2.3%). Dysphagia and early feeling of abdominal fullness scores tended to be high after surgery but gradually decreased after 6\\xa0months. Good results were obtained for reflux feeling scores. Body weight changed with an average decrease of -2\\xa0±\\xa03.71\\xa0kg (\\nReconstruction using SS resulted in an extremely low rate of anastomotic leakage and good QOL postoperatively in patients with EC. To investigate the influence of visceral fat area on postoperative C-reactive protein levels and whether it affects its ability to diagnose infectious complications after laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy.\\nA total of 435 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopy-assisted resection for gastric cancer from 2008 to 2017 were reviewed and divided into four groups according to visceral fat area quartiles. We evaluated the relationship between C-reactive protein and visceral fat area and whether visceral fat area affects the sensitivity and specificity of C-reactive protein in diagnosing postoperative infectious complications.\\nPostoperative C-reactive protein levels increased with increasing visceral fat areas at every postoperative assessment. Multiple linear regression revealed that levels on postoperative day 3 significantly positively correlated with visceral fat area. Postoperative day 3 levels also showed moderate accuracy for diagnosing infectious complications (area under the curve, 0.78; sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.65), with an optimal cut-off of 11.8\\xa0mg/dL. The sensitivity for predicting infectious complications was low in the 1st visceral fat area quartile group but high in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th groups (0.43 vs 1.0 vs 1.0 vs 0.94, respectively). By contrast, the specificity was high in the 1st and 2nd group but low in the 3rd and 4th (0.84 vs 0.70 vs 0.54 vs 0.48, respectively).\\nVisceral fat area positively correlated with postoperative C-reactive protein levels and this affected its accuracy in diagnosing infectious complications. A uniform C-reactive protein cut-off may not provide accurate predictions in patients with more extreme visceral fat areas. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of S-1 combined with palliative care (PC) on the immune function and quality of life (QOL) of patients with advanced stomach cancer (ASC). In this prospective study, 168 patients with ASC admitted to our hospital from September 2016 to March 2018 were enrolled as research objects. Seventy-seven cases were treated with S-1 alone (single drug group, SDG), while another 91 cases were treated with S-1 combined with PC (combined drug group, CDG). The effects of the two therapeutic methods on the efficacy [overall response rate (ORR)], 1-year overall survival rate (OSR), safety, negative emotions, nutritional indices, QOL, and immune function indices of patients were analyzed. After treatment, ORR, OSR, levels of nutritional indices [albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), and transferrin (TF)], and QOL improvement rate in the CDG were significantly higher than those in the SDG (P<0.05). After treatment, compared with those in the SDG, patients in the CDG had a lower Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) score, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) score, and number of adverse reactions (P<0.05), and significantly improved immune function indices (CD4 Cancer causes a major health concern worldwide due to high incidence and mortality rates. To accomplish this purpose, the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched using the keywords bacteria and cancer. Most of published research addressed several different factors that induced cancer, such as toxins, medications, smoking, and obesity. Nonetheless, few studies are dealing with cancer induction via bacterial infection. In addition, mechanisms of cancer induction via bacterial infections are not well understood. Therefore, in this review, we will shed light on different bacteria that induced cancer via different molecular mechanisms. Among the bacterial infection that induced cancer,  Gastritis is a progressive disease that evolves from a non-atrophic to atrophic state and progresses through intestinal metaplasia, with some cases leading eventually to gastric cancer. Since gastritis by definition is an inflammatory process of the mucosal lining of the stomach and is usually associated with pain, we aimed to identify any association between the severity of gastritis and pain and a simple inflammatory marker derived from a complete blood count (CBC). This was a prospective cross-sectional study which enrolled 155 consecutive adult patients who underwent an upper endoscopy. Prior to the endoscopy, all patients were given a questionnaire, numerical rating scale (NRS) and complete blood count evaluation. The biopsy was obtained from the gastric mucosa according to the modified Sydney classification and scored with the Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) scoring system. The results showed a significant correlation between NRS and intestinal metaplasia ( Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with several human malignancies including 8-10% of gastric cancers (GCs). Genome-wide analysis of 3D chromatin topologies across GC lines, primary tissue and normal gastric samples revealed chromatin domains specific to EBV-positive GC, exhibiting heterochromatin-to-euchromatin transitions and long-range human-viral interactions with non-integrated EBV episomes. EBV infection in vitro suffices to remodel chromatin topology and function at EBV-interacting host genomic loci, converting H3K9me3 Systemic inflammatory biomarkers have begun to be used in clinical practice to predict prognosis and survival of cancer patients, but the approach remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the predictive value of the c-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and Glasgow prognostic score (GPS)/modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) in the clinical outcome of gastric cancer (GC) patients. We searched literature databases to identify relevant studies. All articles identified in the search were independently reviewed based on predetermined selection criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of overall survival of the included studies. A total of 41 eligible cohort studies, involving a total of 18,348 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, were considered for meta-analysis. Increases in CRP (HR = 1.654, 95% CI: 1.272-2.151), NLR (HR = 1.605, 95% CI: 1.449-1.779), and GPS/mGPS (HR = 1.648, 95% CI: 1.351-2.011) were significantly associated with poorer survival in patients with GC. Substantial heterogeneities were noted in all three markers (I2 = 86.479%, 50.799%, 69.774%, in CRP, NLR, and GPS/mGPS, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between each marker and poor survival, regardless of country, study quality, cancer stage, study design, or the inclusion of patients undergoing chemotherapy. This meta-analysis demonstrates that CRP, NLR, and GPS/mGPS are associated with poor survival in patients with GC. Further prospective studies using standardized measurements are warranted to conclude the prognostic value of various inflammatory markers. Rates of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas (GEJAs) have shown an alarming increase; however, the genetic background of GEJA and its Siewert classification have yet to be uncovered. Here, 60 paired tumor and normal DNA samples from GEJA patients were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing. Among them, 13 were Siewert type I, 14 were type II, and 33 were type III. A predominance of C/G>T/A substitutions was discovered in GEJA, followed by C/G>A/T substitutions. Notably, Siewert type I and type II/III display distinct sets of driver genes, mutational spectrum, and recurrently disrupted pathways. Siewert type I showed similarity to esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) and the chromosomal instability subtype of stomach adenocarcinomas, while Siewert type II/III showed similarity to the genomic stable subtype of stomach adenocarcinoma. We also found that mutation of FBXW7, a driver gene of GEJA, was enriched in Siewert type I. Our data identify differences between GEJA and stomach/EACs at the genomic level and provide evidence for differential treatment based on Siewert classification of GEJA. © 2020 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Using Registry data, we evaluated the frequency of concurrent venous thromboembolism in cancer patients prior to treatment initiation by cancer type.\\nThe Cancer-VTE Registry is an ongoing (March 2017-September 2020) prospective cohort study using a nationwide, multicentre clinical registry. Participants aged ≥20\\xa0years with colorectal, lung, stomach, pancreatic, breast or gynecologic cancer, confirmed staging, ≥6\\xa0months life expectancy post-registration and who had undergone venous thromboembolism screening were managed with routine clinical care. Venous thromboembolism frequency at registration was evaluated.\\nOf 9735 participants, 571 (5.9%) had venous thromboembolism at baseline, including asymptomatic [5.5% (n\\xa0=\\xa0540)] and symptomatic venous thromboembolism [0.3% (n\\xa0=\\xa031)]. Most participants with venous thromboembolism (n\\xa0=\\xa0506, 5.2%) had deep vein thrombosis only; 65 (0.7%) had pulmonary embolism with/without deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis was 4.8% (n\\xa0=\\xa0466) and 0.9% (n\\xa0=\\xa083), respectively. The highest prevalence of venous thromboembolism was for pancreatic cancer (8.5%) and the lowest for breast cancer (2.0%). Venous thromboembolism prevalence increased as cancer stage advanced.\\nAlthough there was a marked difference in venous thromboembolism by cancer type, the data suggest that cancer stage is an important risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Thus, metastasis seems a critical risk factor for venous thromboembolism. This is the first demonstration of venous thromboembolism prevalence and risk factors in Japanese cancer patients prior to treatment.\\nUMIN000024942. We prospectively enrolled children between the ages of 4 and 17 years from April 2019 to July 2019. Enrolled children were patients with nongastrointestinal complaints at the pediatric clinics of two hospitals and at community centers caring for healthy children in Irbid, Jordan. Questionnaires obtaining data on sociodemographics, clinical symptomatology, and hygienic risk factors were completed. Recruited children underwent a urea breath test (UBT).\\nOf 340 children who were recruited, 328 (96.5%) were included in the final analysis. The mean age (±standard deviation) was 9.56 (±3.98) years (range, 4.0-17 years), and 168 (51.2%) were males. Only 48 children (14.6%) tested positive. There were no gender differences. Living in an urban area and a family history of previous  Neutrophils are a significant population of infiltrated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in the biological behavior of many malignant tumors. NETs can be degraded into soluble nucleosomes, leading to the release of fragments containing DNA and granule proteins into the peripheral blood (PB). Using human gastric cancer (GC) biopsies and PB samples, we investigated the specific value of NETs in GC from a clinical perspective. In summary, the formation of NETs was discovered in the tissue microenvironment and PB of GC patients. The amounts of NETs and neutrophil accumulation decreased from tumor tissue to paratumor tissue. In addition, the level of NETs in the PB gradually declined through the following patient populations: advanced disease patients, preoperative patients, postoperative patients, benign disease patients, and healthy controls. The levels of NETs in the plasma and serum were significantly correlated. As a serum biomarker, NETs had a better diagnostic value than carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) in GC. The neutrophil count and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly associated with the level of NETs in the PB. The existence of lymph node metastasis indicated a high level of NETs in the serum. Moreover, the level of NETs in the PB was inversely correlated with short-term efficacy in GC patients who had received advanced first-line treatment. The higher baseline level of NETs in the PB of patients with negative HER2 status was correlated with worse progression-free survival (PFS). And the level of NETs in the PB was a unfavorable independent prognostic factor for PFS in patients with advanced GC who had received first-line treatment. Thus, NETs have novel diagnostic, therapeutic predictive, and prognostic value in GC patients. Kidney transplantation (KT) is the most desired and cost-effective modality of renal replacement therapy for patients with chronic kidney failure. KT protects the patient from complications that may develop during chronic dialysis. Unfortunately, evidence also suggests that KT patients are more prone to developing cancer than healthy persons. Many complications after renal transplantation can be prevented if they are detected early. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of gastrointestinal pathologies in patients after KT.\\nAdult patients after KT who are under the care of the Outpatient Department of Nephrology at the Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland, received alarm symptom questionnaires and referral for testing for the presence of fecal occult blood. Then, in 58 selected patients (36 men and 22 women), endoscopic examination was performed. Mean age was 57.34 ± 10.1 (range, 35-83) years.\\nOut of 940 patients after KT, resting under supervision of the Outpatient Department, 208 patients completed the questionnaire and 118 gave a stool sample for testing: 40 results were positive. After analyzing the questionnaires and stool results, 100 patients qualiﬁed for further investigation. The endoscopic examination had been performed so far in 58 patients and revealed gastritis and/or duodenitis in 49 patients, diverticular colon disease in 26, esophagitis in 8, colon polyps in 16, stomach polyps in 4, inﬂammatory bowel disease in 12, and cancers in\\xa03.\\nThe preliminary results indicate that patients after KT have signiﬁcant risk of gastrointestinal pathologies and require detailed diagnostic endoscopy. Premature mortality offers an alternative approach for monitoring the burden of mortality; however, little is known about its measures for stomach cancer. In the present study, we investigated temporal changes in premature mortality because of stomach cancer in the Japanese population from 1980 to 2015.\\nMortality data for stomach cancer were obtained from the World Health Organization mortality database. Years of life lost (YLL) was calculated using Japanese life tables. The average lifespan shortened was calculated and defined as the ratio of YLL in relation to the expected lifespan.\\nOver a 35-year time frame, the age-standardized rates adjusted to the World Standard Population for deaths from stomach cancer substantially decreased in both sexes. The results from the average YLL (AYLL) measure showed that lifespan of stomach cancer patients was prolonged by about 3 and 5 years in men and women, respectively. The average lifespan shortened measure showed that stomach cancer led to a loss of 18.5% of lifespan among men and of 21.9% among women in 1980, but these numbers were reduced to 13.6% and 14.5%, respectively, in 2015.\\nOur study demonstrated decreasing trends in premature mortality for stomach cancer in Japan over a 35-year period. Gastric squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC) metastasized form the cervix is rarely detected in endoscopic examination, although cervical carcinoma is the second most common in gynecologic malignancy. A 59-year-old female visited a clinic for anorexia, and an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) revealed multiple submucosal tumors (SMTs) of the stomach. After she was referred, an image-enhanced endoscopy enhanced multiple SMTs with white spots, whose findings were irregular micro-vascular patterns in the mucosa with irregular/absent micro-surface pattern. We took endoscopic biopsies, whose histological diagnoses were SqCC in the layer of the lamina propria under normal epithelium. Positron emission tomography-CT, CT and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an irregularly enhanced mass of the cervix, the irregularly thickening wall of the stomach and peritoneal nodules. Palliative care alone was administered based on poor condition associated with the Stage IV cervical carcinoma. In this case, endoscopic detection of gastric SqCC might provide a tip to make final diagnosis of primary site of cervical SqCC. The numbers of endoscopic examination become increasing, so further deep awareness of such patterns of metastasis in cervical cancer are required. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are functional RNA molecules that play crucial regulatory roles in many fundamental biological processes. The dysregulation of ncRNAs is significantly associated with the progression of human cancers, including gastric cancer. In this review, we have summarized the oncogenic or tumor-suppressive roles and the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs, miRNAs, circRNAs and piRNAs, and have discussed their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in gastric cancer. Intestinal metaplasia (IM) refers to the replacement of gastric epithelial cells by intestinal epithelial cells. This is often accompanied by chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), which is a precancerous lesion of gastric cancer. The incidence rates of CAG and IM are increasing gradually, which generates an enormous economic burden to individuals and society. To explore the pathogenesis of CAG with IM, we screened out the differentially expressed gene olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) by bioinformatics and constructed OLFM4-shRNA plasmid chitosan magnetic nanoparticles to knockdown this gene. This caused a downregulation of caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), a marker of IM, suggesting that knocking down OLFM4 may slow the pathological process of IM, thus providing putative relevant targets for the treatment of CAG with IM. This study investigated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and stomach cancer, with considering the impacts of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and tobacco smoking.\\nA case-control study featuring 80 male incident stomach-cancer cases and 146 male controls was conducted in a general hospital in Viet Nam. A semi-quantitative food frequency and demographic lifestyle questionnaire were used; and venous blood samples were collected to determine H. pylori status by IgG ELISA. The respective associations between fruit and vegetable intake and stomach cancer were examined using unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustments for possible cofactors.\\nFruit intake and stomach cancer showed a weak inverse association when this became non-significant after adjusting for H. pylori infection (OR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.22-1.12, p trend = 0.094). Stratifying by H. pylori status returned a negative trend for fruit intake and stomach cancer among H. pylori-negative participants (OR = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.06-0.69, p trend = 0.010), but no significant interaction for H. pylori-positive participants (OR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.21-2.68, p trend = 0.670). Vegetable intake and stomach cancer showed no association, regardless of H. pylori status. Compared to ever-smokers with low intake, never-smokers with high vegetable (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.06-0.95) and fruit intake (OR = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.06-0.65) showed the lowest odds of stomach cancer.\\nFruit, but not vegetable, intake showed a weak inverse association with stomach cancer. H. pylori infection and tobacco-smoking status may influence the protective effects of fruit and vegetable intake on stomach cancer.<br />. MiR-135b is a downstream effector of oncogenic signaling pathways. This study aimed to reveal the underlying regulation and significance of miR-135b in gastric cancer.\\nThe influence of Wnt and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways on the transcriptional activation of the miR-135b promoter was determined by dual-luciferase reporter assays. In vitro experiments, including the cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2\\'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, flow cytometry analysis and malignant phenotype profiles, were conducted to determine the oncogenic role of miR-135b in gastric cancer. To analyze the clinical significance of miR-135b in gastric cancer, the expression profile of miR-135b in tissue specimens and plasma was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).\\nOncogenic signaling pathways represented by Wnt and PI3K/AKT promoted the transcriptional activation of the miR-135b promoter in gastric cancer. Downregulation of miR-135b inhibited proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and suppressed the migratory, invasive, and adherent abilities as well as the cancer stem cell phenotype of gastric cancer cells. High expression of miR-135b in gastric cancer tissues was tightly associated with poor prognosis and malignant transformation represented by metastasis of gastric cancer. The miR-135b level in the plasma of gastric cancer patients was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals.\\nMiR-135b is a potential downstream effector of the Wnt and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in gastric cancer. High expression of miR-135b may predict malignant transformation and poor prognosis of gastric cancer. This study reveals the potential role of miR-135b as a target for the early diagnosis and therapy of gastric cancer. Malakoplakia is an uncommon, tumor-like inflammatory disease characterized by impaired histiocytes that are unable to completely digest phagocytized bacteria. The genitourinary tract is the most common site of involvement, however, cases have also been described in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that it is the second most common site of involvement. This study investigates the clinical and histologic features of malakoplakia in the gastrointestinal tract.\\nFor 23 gastrointestinal specimens (biopsies and resections) from patients with a pathologic diagnosis of malakoplakia, we recorded the gender, age, location, primary diagnosis, endoscopic or surgical indication, endoscopic/gross impression and immune status (immunocompromised vs. immunocompetent).\\nMalakoplakia occurred throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract with most of the cases located in the sigmoid colon and rectum (n\\u2009=\\u200910); other sites included the transverse and descending colon (n\\u2009=\\u20094), stomach/gastroesophageal junction (n\\u2009=\\u20094), appendix (n\\u2009=\\u20092), cecum (n\\u2009=\\u20091), small bowel (n\\u2009=\\u20091), and the peri-anal area (n\\u2009=\\u20091). Endoscopically, these lesions most commonly appeared as polyps (n\\u2009=\\u200910) or masses (n\\u2009=\\u20095), other clinical endoscopic impressions varied from a thickened area/fibrosis to mucosal erythema. Most patients were immunocompromised due to a disease state (e.g. organ transplantation, cancer diagnosis, autoimmune condition) and/or medication effect. Eight patients with malakoplakia were on immunosuppressive medications (8/23, 35%). Common immunosuppressed disease states included cancer (n\\u2009=\\u20099), autoimmune disease (n\\u2009=\\u20095), status post organ transplantation (n\\u2009=\\u20094), diabetes (n\\u2009=\\u20095), infection/sepsis (n\\u2009=\\u20093), and HIV/AIDS (n\\u2009=\\u20091). Some patients had multiple co-morbidities (i.e. diabetes and organ transplant). Twenty-one patients with malakoplakia were in an immunosuppressive state (21/23, 91%). Chemotherapy-induced adverse effects can reduce the relative dose intensity and quality of life. In this study, we investigated the potential benefit of supplementary anamorelin and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) as preventive interventions against a gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) combination chemotherapy-induced adverse effects in a mouse model. Non-cancer-bearing C3H mice were randomly allocated as follows and treated for 2 weeks-(1) non-treated control, (2) oral anamorelin alone, (3) oral 5-ALA alone, (4) gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy, (5) GC plus anamorelin, and (6) GC plus 5-ALA. GC chemotherapy significantly decreased body weight, food intake, skeletal muscle mass and induced severe gastric mucositis, which resulted in decreased ghrelin production and blood ghrelin level. The supplementation of oral anamorelin to GC chemotherapy successfully mitigated decrease of food intake during the treatment period and body weight loss at day 8. In addition, analysis of the resected muscles and stomach revealed that anamorelin suppressed chemotherapy-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by mediating the downregulation of forkhead box protein O-1 (FOXO1)/atrogin-1 signaling and gastric damage. Our findings suggest the preventive effect of anamorelin against GC combination chemotherapy, which was selected for patients with some types of advanced malignancies in clinical practice. Mostly primary gastric lymphomas are of the non-Hodgkin variety. Primary Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) of the stomach is an unusual entity that may be a big challenge in diagnosis. We reporter are case presenting as gastric outlet obstruction, which was later diagnosed as primary Hodgkin\\'s Lymphoma of the stomach. Its rare coincidence makes it worth to be reported to sensitize clinicians as well as pathologists for the uncommon extra nodal site of Hodgkin\\'s Lymphoma. Stomach cancer is a major global health problem; it is one of the ten most common cancers with poor survival, and its incidence is characterized by wide variation. The aim of this work is to carry out a retrospective epidemiological study on gastric cancer in the wilaya of Tlemcen (West Algeria) over a period of 5\\xa0years (2011-2015).\\nThe data set was provided by the cancer registry of the Tlemcen wilaya. The statistical analysis was performed using software SPSS.21.\\nDuring this period, 394 cases of gastric cancers were collected, including 199 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (50.50%); gastric cancer was ranked in 5th rank of the ten most answered cancers in the wilaya. The average age of the patients was 60.5\\u2009±\\u2009\\xa014.208\\xa0years (60.618\\u2009±\\u2009\\xa013.556 men, 56.654\\u2009±\\u2009\\xa014.8761 women) with an extremity ranging from 18 to 91\\xa0years. A predominance of men has been observed with 60.4% against 39.6% of women, with a sex ratio of 1.5 and a significant difference between the two sexes (p\\u2009=\\u20090.08). Patients over 50\\xa0years of age represented the predominant age group (73.4%). The tumor topography was antropyloric in 6.09% of the cases, and the vast majority of the diagnosed cases was in the local stage (17.01%).\\nStomach cancer remains one of the top ten cancers in the Tlemcen willaya, so extensive research on the risk factors for gastric cancer remains important to plan effective preventive and curative strategies to reduce this burden. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the stomach are the most common GISTs. The risk, incidence, and outcome of cancer are different between the sexes. Whether gender is related to the prognosis of gastric stromal tumors is unclear. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between gender and gastric GIST prognosis.\\nData from gastric GIST patients were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce confounding factors, and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of GIST patients were comprehensively evaluated.\\nThere were 512 male patients and 538 female patients with gastric GIST. The gender of gastric GIST patients was associated with marital status, surgical treatment, tumor size, and mitotic index (P < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test revealed that male patients had a higher mortality rate than female patients (P = 0.0024). After matching all the potential confounding factors, the survival of the female gastric GIST patients was better than that of the male gastric GIST patients (P = 0.042). Cox regression analysis revealed that gender was an independent risk factor for overall survival. The risk of death was higher for males than for females (HR 1.677, 95% CI 1.150-2.444, P = 0.007).\\nGender could be a prognostic factor for gastric GIST survival, and male patients had a higher risk of death. Although previous studies have utilized narrow band imaging endoscopy diagnosis (NBIED) in detection of patients with early gastric cancer (EGC), there are still inconsistent results. Thus, this study will explore the accuracy of NBIED in detection of patients with EGC.\\nWe propose to perform literature search of potential studies investigating the accuracy of NBIED in detection of patients with EGC in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WANGFANG, VIP database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from the beginning of each database to January 31, 2020 without restrictions to language and publication time. Two authors will independently scrutinize these databases to identify studies that satisfy all predefined eligibility criteria. We will check study quality and analyze outcome data using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool, and RevMan 5.3 software respectively.\\nWe anticipate the results of this study will afford additional insight into the appraising of the accuracy of NBIED in patients with EGC.\\nThe findings of this study will be useful informing diagnostic decisions for the diagnosis of patients with EGC.PROSPERO registration number: PROSPERO CRD42020171053. Side effects after surgical therapy and chemotherapy of gastric cancer substantially reduce patients\\' quality of life. This systematic review aims to investigate whether moxibustion, as a complementary treatment, is effective in alleviating side effects in patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgical therapy or chemotherapy.\\nWe will systematically search nine English and Chinese electronic databases to find relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare basic treatment with and without moxibustion for treating the side effects induced by surgical therapy or chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer. The time frame of the search will be from inception to July 1, 2020, and the publication language will not be limited. The literature screening and data extraction will be completed independently by 2 reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess the risk of bias. For the analyses of the side effects of both surgical therapy and chemotherapy, the primary outcomes are defined as the incidence of any side effect, response rate, and quality of life. For the analyses of the side effects of surgical therapy, the secondary outcomes include the incidence of each individual side effect, time to first flatus/defecation/bowel sounds, and length of in-hospital stay. For the analysis of the side effects of chemotherapy, the secondary outcomes include incidence of each individual side effect, white blood cell/red blood cell/platelets counts, and hemoglobin level. R v3.6.2 software will be used to perform the meta-analyses. The quality of evidence will be classified using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.\\nThis study will provide the first systematic review evidence on the efficacy of moxibustion as adjuvant management for gastric cancer by rigorous quality assessment and appropriate data synthesis. The results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.\\nThe findings of this study will provide currently best evidence on moxibustion for patients with gastric cancer who underwent surgical therapy or chemotherapy and may impact clinical practice.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020169511. Probiotics are live microorganisms (usually bacteria), which are defined by their ability to confer health benefits to the host, if administered adequately. Probiotics are not only used as health supplements but have also been applied in various attempts to prevent and treat gastrointestinal (GI) and non-gastrointestinal diseases such as diarrhea, colon cancer, obesity, diabetes, and inflammation. One of the challenges in the use of probiotics is putative loss of viability by the time of administration. It can be due to procedures that the probiotic products go through during fabrication, storage, or administration. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymers with specific moieties or pH/enzyme sensitivity have shown great potential as carriers of the bacteria for 1) better viability, 2) longer storage times, 3) preservation from the aggressive environment in the stomach and 4) topographically targeted delivery of probiotics. In this review, we focus on polymeric carriers and the procedures applied for encapsulation of the probiotics into them. At the end, some novel methods for specific probiotic delivery, possibilities to improve the targeted delivery of probiotics and some challenges are discussed. Genome-wide association studies of gastric cancer (GC) cases have revealed common gastric cancer susceptibility loci with low effect size. We investigated rare variants with high effect size via whole-exome sequencing (WES) of subjects with familial clustering of gastric cancer. WES of DNAs from the blood of 19 gastric cancer patients and 36 unaffected family members from 14 families with two or more gastric cancer patients were tested. Linkage analysis combined with association tests were performed using Pedigree Variant Annotation, Analysis, and Search Tool (pVAAST) software. Based on the logarithm of odds (LOD) and permutation-based composite likelihood ratio test (CLRT) from pVAAST, MUC4 was identified as a predisposing gene (LOD P-value = 1.9×10-5; permutation-based P-value of CLRT ≤ 9.9×10-9). In a larger cohort consisting of 597 GC patients and 9,759 healthy controls genotyped with SNP array, we discovered common variants in MUC4 regions (rs148735556, rs11717039, and rs547775645) significantly associated with GC supporting the association of MUC4 with gastric cancer. And the MUC4 variants were found in higher frequency in The Cancer Genome Atlas Study (TCGA) germline samples of patients with multiple cancer types. Immunohistochemistry indicated that MUC4 was downregulated in the noncancerous gastric mucosa of subjects with MUC4 germline missense variants, suggesting that loss of the protective function of MUC4 predisposes an individual to gastric cancer. Rare variants in MUC4 can be novel gastric cancer susceptibility loci in Koreans possessing the familial clustering of gastric cancer. Smoking is a well-established cause of lung cancer and there is strong evidence that smoking also increases the risk of several other cancers. Alcohol consumption has been inconsistently associated with cancer risk in observational studies. This mendelian randomisation (MR) study sought to investigate associations in support of a causal relationship between smoking and alcohol consumption and 19 site-specific cancers.\\nWe used summary-level data for genetic variants associated with smoking initiation (ever smoked regularly) and alcohol consumption, and the corresponding associations with lung, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer from genome-wide association studies consortia, including participants of European ancestry. We additionally estimated genetic associations with 19 site-specific cancers among 367,643 individuals of European descent in UK Biobank who were 37 to 73 years of age when recruited from 2006 to 2010. Associations were considered statistically significant at a Bonferroni corrected p-value below 0.0013. Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation was associated with statistically significant higher odds of lung cancer in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (odds ratio [OR] 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-2.03; p = 2.26 × 10-21) and UK Biobank (OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.92-2.65; p = 1.17 × 10-22). Additionally, genetic predisposition to smoking was associated with statistically significant higher odds of cancer of the oesophagus (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.34-2.49; p = 1.31 × 10-4), cervix (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.27-1.88; p = 1.24 × 10-5), and bladder (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.92-2.65; p = 9.40 × 10-5) and with statistically nonsignificant higher odds of head and neck (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.13-1.74; p = 0.002) and stomach cancer (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.05-2.03; p = 0.024). In contrast, there was an inverse association between genetic predisposition to smoking and prostate cancer in the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83-0.98; p = 0.011) and in UK Biobank (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80-1.02; p = 0.104), but the associations did not reach statistical significance. We found no statistically significant association between genetically predicted alcohol consumption and overall cancer (n = 75,037 cases; OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.84-1.07; p = 0.376). Genetically predicted alcohol consumption was statistically significantly associated with lung cancer in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.41-2.68; p = 4.68 × 10-5) but not in UK Biobank (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.65-1.93; p = 0.686). There was no statistically significant association between alcohol consumption and any other site-specific cancer. The main limitation of this study is that precision was low in some analyses, particularly for analyses of alcohol consumption and site-specific cancers.\\nOur findings support the well-established relationship between smoking and lung cancer and suggest that smoking may also be a risk factor for cancer of the head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, cervix, and bladder. We found no evidence supporting a relationship between alcohol consumption and overall or site-specific cancer risk. Analysis of serum biomarkers for the assessment of atrophic gastritis (AG), considered as gastric precancerous lesion, is of growing interest and recommended by current guidelines. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a panel of biomarkers (GastroPanel®) for the detection of AG in France, a country of a low gastric cancer (GC) incidence.\\nIn this prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study, consecutive patients considered at increased risk of GC and undergoing upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies were included. Blood samples were collected for the analysis of GastroPanel® (association of Pepsinogens I and II, Gastrin-17, and Helicobacter pylori serology) using ELISA. The results of GastroPanel® were compared to the results of histology considered as the reference.\\nBetween 2016 and 2019, 344 patients (148 cases with AG, 196 controls without AG) were included. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for the detection of AG by GastroPanel® were of 39.9% (95% CI 31.9; 48.2), 93.4% (95% CI 88.9; 96.4), 81.9 (95% CI 71.1; 90.0), and 67.3 (95% CI 61.4; 72.8), respectively. The sensitivity was significantly higher for the detection of severe AG [60.8% (95% CI 46.1; 74.6) P\\xa0=\\xa0.015] and corpus AG [61.0% (95% CI 49.2; 72.0), P\\xa0=\\xa0.004]. Diagnostic performances of GastroPanel® tended to be better than those of Pepsinogen I alone, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P\\xa0=\\xa0.068).\\nSerum pepsinogen and GastroPanel® tests show promising results for the detection of AG, especially of corpus AG and severe AG, in patients at high risk of GC in France. Stomach cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death globally. Helicobacter pylori plays a role in the healthy human gut, but is also associated with multiple chronic diseases, including stomach cancer. Though H. pylori prevalence is declining in parts of the world, it remains high among certain populations. In Arizona, stomach cancer rates are 3-4 times higher among the Navajo Nation population as compared with the non-Hispanic white population. This pilot project assessed adult Diné (Navajo) individuals\\' understanding and awareness regarding H. pylori infection and stomach cancer. Focus groups were held in three Diné communities. Data were analyzed thematically using a multi-investigator consensus approach. Participants had limited knowledge of H. pylori infection and stomach cancer and perceived local medical providers as also having limited knowledge on these conditions. Participants described poor health care experiences, structural inequalities, and environmental concerns and associated these with H. pylori infection and stomach cancer. This study highlights the need for additional research and education on current knowledge and perceptions of stomach cancer and H. pylori infections in Navajo Nation. The double-tract reconstruction (DTR) could be a preferable option in avoiding the postoperative esophageal reflux and anastomotic stenosis during totally laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (TLPG). An optimal procedure to achieve the DTR in TLPG remains to be established.\\nDuring March 2018 to April 2019, 15 consecutive patients with gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach underwent intracorporeal DTR after TLPG at our hospital. The intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (E-J), gastrojejunostomy (G-J) and jejunojejunostomy (J-J) were, respectively, performed using circular staplers by the Self-Pulling and Holding Purse-String Suture Technique, Intraluminal Poke Technique and U-shaped Parallel Purse-string Suture Technique (Technical Tie-Up). Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, perioperative details and postoperative outcomes were analyzed.\\nThe mean operating time was 216.1\\u2009±\\u200918.2\\xa0min. Total time for three anastomoses was 49.8\\u2009±\\u20096.1\\xa0min, and the time for E-J, G-J, J-J was 22.4\\u2009±\\u20095.0\\xa0min, 13 (range 11-16) min, 14.2\\u2009±\\u20092.8\\xa0min, respectively. The median proximal and distal resection margins were 2.5 (range 2-4) cm and 6 (range 5-7) cm, respectively, which were all tumor-free in 15 patients. No major complications and mortality occurred. During the median follow-up period of 14\\xa0months (range 7 to 20.5\\xa0months), there were no postoperative anastomosis-related complications observed, such as anastomotic bleeding, leakage or stenosis. No patients complained the symptoms indicating esophageal reflux and remnant gastritis.\\nPredominant classic circular-stapled double-tract reconstruction is safe, feasible and time-saving in TLPG by the technical tie-up. Glomerular hyperfiltration is associated with all-cause mortality. Herein, we evaluated the association between glomerular hyperfiltration and the development of cancer, the most common cause of death, in an Asian population.\\nWe retrospectively reviewed the National Health Insurance Service database of Korea for people who received national health screenings from 2012 to 2013. Glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as the 95th percentile and greater after stratification by sex and age decile. We performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis using glomerular hyperfiltration at the first health screening as the exposure variable and cancer development as the outcome variable to evaluate the impact of glomerular hyperfiltration on the development of cancer.\\nA total of 1,953,123 examinations for patients with a median follow-up time of 4.4 years were included in this study. Among the 8 different site-specific cancer categories, digestive organs showed significant associations between glomerular hyperfiltration and cancer. The population with glomerular hyperfiltration showed an increased risk for stomach cancer [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.22], colorectal cancer (aHR = 1.16), and liver or intrahepatic malignancy (aHR = 1.35).\\nGlomerular hyperfiltration was associated with an increased risk for the development of cancer in specific organs, such as the stomach, colorectum, and liver and intrahepatic organ.\\nGlomerular hyperfiltration needs to be considered a significant sign of the need to evaluate the possibility of hidden adverse health conditions, including malignancies. Early detection has the potential to reduce cancer mortality, but an effective screening test must demonstrate asymptomatic cancer detection years before conventional diagnosis in a longitudinal study. In the Taizhou Longitudinal Study (TZL), 123,115 healthy subjects provided plasma samples for long-term storage and were then monitored for cancer occurrence. Here we report the preliminary results of PanSeer, a noninvasive blood test based on circulating tumor DNA methylation, on TZL plasma samples from 605 asymptomatic individuals, 191 of whom were later diagnosed with stomach, esophageal, colorectal, lung or liver cancer within four years of blood draw. We also assay plasma samples from an additional 223 cancer patients, plus 200 primary tumor and normal tissues. We show that PanSeer detects five common types of cancer in 88%\\xa0(95% CI: 80-93%) of post-diagnosis patients with a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 93-98%), We also demonstrate that PanSeer detects cancer in 95%\\xa0(95% CI: 89-98%) of asymptomatic individuals who were later diagnosed, though future longitudinal studies are required to confirm this result. These results demonstrate that cancer can be non-invasively detected up to four years before current standard of care. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of the fastest-growing cancers in the world. It occurs primarily due to the chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), during which the esophageal epithelium is frequently exposed to the acidic fluid coming up from the stomach. This triggers gene mutations in the esophageal cells, which may lead to EAC development. While p53 is activated to get rid of the mutated cells, NFκB orchestrates the remaining cells to heal the wound. However, if the mutations happen to TP53 (a common occasion), the mutant product turns to support tumorigenesis. In this case, NFκB goes along with the mutant p53 to facilitate cancer progression. TRAIL is one of the cytokines produced in response to GERD episodes and it can kill cancer cells selectively, but its clinical use has not been as successful as expected, because some highly sophisticated defense mechanisms against TRAIL have developed during the malignancy. To clear the obstacles for TRAIL action, using a second agent to disarm the cancer cells is required. CCN1 appears to be such a molecule. While supporting normal esophageal cell growth, CCN1 suppresses malignant transformation by inhibiting NFκB and kills the EAC cell through TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Gastric cancer after Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication is a crucial clinical challenge today as HP eradication therapy is widely performed. Detecting gastric cancer after HP eradication tends to be difficult with normal white-light endoscopy. In the present study, we aimed to identify easily-evaluated endoscopic findings that indicate the presence of gastric cancer after HP eradication so that endoscopists can consider additional detailed examinations at the site.\\nWe analyzed the endoscopic images of 43 patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer after HP eradication and 119 patients with an HP eradication history who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for a medical checkup. Endoscopic findings were evaluated according to the Kyoto classification of gastritis (atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, enlarged folds, nodularity, and diffuse redness) and map-like redness.\\nPatients with gastric cancer had significantly higher total Kyoto risk scores; more atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and diffuse redness; and a significantly higher prevalence of map-like redness compared with those without gastric cancer, in the univariate analyses. We used logistic regression analysis with forward selection based on the likelihood ratio to develop a model using atrophy and diffuse redness. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a score of A2 in the Kyoto classification of gastritis (open-type atrophic pattern in the Kimura-Takemoto classification) was an endoscopic marker for the presence of post-HP-eradication gastric cancer.\\nEndoscopic severe gastric mucosal atrophy is useful to screen patients for gastric cancer after HP eradication. Cancer metastasis and resistance for chemotherapeutic agent correlate with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while ROS production also involves in the EMT process, However, how autophagy mediated ROS production affects EMT remains unclear. Previous study showed that DpdtC (2,2\\'-di-pyridylketone hydrazone dithiocarbamate) could induce ferritinophagy in HepG2 cell. To insight into more details that how ferritinophagy affects cellular feature, the SGC-7901and BGC-823 gastric cancer cell lines were used. Interestingly DpdtC treatment resulted in EMT inhibition and was ROS dependent. Similar situation occurred in TGF-β1 induced EMT model, supporting that DpdtC was able to inhibit EMT. Next the ability of DpdtC in ferritinophagy induction was further evaluated. As expected, DpdtC induced ferritinophagy in the absence and presence of TGF-β1. The correlation analysis revealed that an enhanced ferritinophagic flux contributed to the EMT inhibition. In addition, ferritinophagy triggers Fenton reaction, resulting in ROS production which give rise of p53 response, thus the role of p53 was further investigated. DpdtC treatment resulted in upregulation of p53, but, the addition of p53 inhibitor, PFT-α could significantly neutralize the action of DpdtC on ferritinophagy induction and EMT inhibition. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitors or NAC could counteract the action of DpdtC, indicating that ferrtinophagy-mediated ROS played an important role in the cellular events. In addition to upregulation of p53, its down-stream targets, AKT/mTor were also downregulated, supporting that DpdtC induced EMT inhibition was achieved through ferritinophagy-ROS vicious cycle mediated p53/AKT/mTor pathway. And the activation of ferritinophagic flux was the dominant driving force in action of DpdtC in gastric cancer cells. Primary gastric melanoma (PGM) is a rare malignant tumour of the stomach with poor prognosis. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the available literature on this entity and to highlight its biological behaviour and preferred treatment approach.\\nPubMed and Cochrane bibliographical databases were independently searched (last search: 2 February 2020) by two investigators for articles reporting on PGM in the adult population.\\nTwenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and concerned collectively 25 patients (18 males and seven females) with an age of 63.4\\u2009±\\u20098.97\\u2009years (mean\\u2009±\\u2009standard deviation). Main symptoms included abdominal pain (64%), weight loss (48%) and hematemesis or melena (32%). The most frequent tumour location was the body of the stomach (54.2%). All tumours were surgically resected and the majority of the patients had a partial gastrectomy (52%). Median recurrence time was 5 months and 12% of patients reached 5-year survival landmark.\\nPGM is a rare disease characterized by an aggressive malignant behaviour. Its differential diagnosis from a metastatic lesion is crucial. A prompt diagnosis and therapeutic approach are needed. Further studies are required to elucidate the optimal management of this clinical entity. Schwannomas are tumors arising from Schwan cells of the neural sheath. Gastrointestinal schwannomas (GS) are rare and easily confused with a heterogeneous group of neuroectodermal or mesenchymal neoplasms. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinicopathological features, surgical management methods, and long-term prognoses of GS patients.\\nBetween August 2004 and July 2019, 51 patients with GS were treated at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The medical records were reviewed retrospectively. A database containing demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, imaging tests, operation details, pathological results, and prognoses was constructed and analyzed.\\nGS accounted for 2.0% of all schwannomas. The cohort comprised 19 men (37.3%) and 32 women (62.7%). The mean age was 55.7 ± 11.4 years. The most common symptom was abdominal pain (29.4%). Twenty-seven patients (52.9%) were asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally. The most common tumor location of GS was the stomach (90.2%). S-100 had the highest positive rate (100%) in immunohistochemical staining. Forty-six patients (90.2%) were followed-up at a mean period of 49.5 ± 41.4 months. Forty-four patients (95.7%) survived without tumor, 1 patient survived with tumor, and 1 patient died. The 5-year cumulative overall survival rate and cumulative disease-free survival rate were 97.5% and 95.2%, respectively.\\nGS are rare gastrointestinal tumors with favorable prognoses after surgical resection. Stomach is the most common site. Definitive diagnosis is determined by postoperative pathology. S-100 expression has diagnostic significance. Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is one of the most common malignancies. But the molecular mechanism is unknown. In this study, we downloaded the transcriptional profiles and clinical data of 344 STAD and 30 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Stromal and immune scores of STAD were calculated by the Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumor tissues using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm, and association of stromal/immune scores with tumor differentiation/T/N/M stage and survival was investigated. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low score groups (based on media) were identified, and prognostic genes over-/underexpressed in both STAD and stromal/immune signature were retrieved. Furthermore, proportions of 22 infiltrating immune cells for the cohort from TCGA were estimated by the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm, and association of 22 immune cells with tumor differentiation/T/N/M stage and survival was investigated. Next, coexpression analysis of 22 immune cells and intersection genes over-/underexpressed in both STAD and stromal signature was conducted. We found high stromal and immune scores and macrophage infiltration predicting poor tumor differentiation and severe local invasion, obtained a list of prognostic genes based on stromal-immune signature, and explored the interaction of collagen, chemokines such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, and macrophage through coexpression analysis and may provide novel prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets for STAD. Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is a common malignancy worldwide with poor prognosis. Therefore, it is important to identify a valuable prognostic biomarker for STAD. The aim of present study was to identify novel prognostic biomarkers for STAD and evaluate the potential role of hub genes in STAD.\\nGene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Cancer RNA-Seq Nexus were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, hub genes were selected by a Venn diagram, and the expression of key genes was confirmed by UALCAN database. Furthermore, survival analysis of these hub genes was performed using Oncolnc and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Gene alteration status of hub genes was assessed by cBioPortal. Finally, we investigated the association between hub genes and immune cell infiltration in STAD through the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and GEPIA database.\\nThree common hub genes were obtained, including 2 downregulated DEGs (ABCA8 and FABP4) and one upregulated DEG (SLC52A3). Furthermore, increased expression of ABCA8 and FABP4 and decreased expression of SLC52A3 were correlated with poor prognosis. Meanwhile, three hub genes showed genetic alterations in various datasets of STAD. Finally, our results showed that ABCA8 and FABP4 displayed a positive correlation with immune infiltration, especially in M2 macrophages.\\nThe results of this study suggest that ABCA8 and FABP4 may be used as prognostic biomarkers and correlated with immune infiltration in STAD. BACKGROUND Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is a mature B cell lymphoma that mostly involves the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. Involvement of extramedullary sites is very rare and has not been reported as the primary site before. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old man presented with reflux symptoms. Gastroscopy revealed a 1.5-cm gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) polyp and oesophageal ulcer. A biopsy was performed and histopathology showed active chronic inflammation with focal intestinal metaplasia and reactive epithelial changes. A CT abdomen showed eccentric thickening of the lower oesophagus and GEJ, with periesophageal, gastro-hepatic ligament, and coeliac lymph node (LN) enlargement. A laparoscopic biopsy showed no peritoneal disease. EUS showed a large ulcerated lesion in the GEJ and proximal stomach. Both were biopsied, showing squamous-columnar mucosa with edema and a population of plasma cells, small lymphocytes, and histiocytes. These expressed CD20, PAX5, CD79a, IgM, and were lambda light chain-restricted. Lymphocytes were negative for CD3, IgG, IgA, and IgD. The MIB-1 index was low. LPL was diagnosed. PET showed an increased uptake of the gastric cardia and GEJ. LNs were not metabolically active. Bone marrow was negative. Evaluation of MYD 88 mutational status failed. Serum immunofixation showed no paraprotein. These results led to a diagnosis of primary isolated LPL of the stomach. CONCLUSIONS Primary lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma may present as an isolated gastric tumor. This can be unassociated with a paraprotein in serum and increased lymphocyte/plasma cell populations within the bone marrow. Gastric LPL is rare. Physicians and pathologists need to be aware of this rare presentation. Gastroparesis is a symptomatic chronic disorder of the stomach characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Several endoscopic treatment modalities have been described that aim to improve gastric emptying and/or symptoms associated with gastroparesis refractory to dietary and pharmacologic management.\\nIn this report we review devices and techniques for endoscopic treatment of gastroparesis, the evidence regarding their efficacy and safety, and the financial considerations for their use.\\nEndoscopic modalities for treatment of gastroparesis can be broadly categorized into pyloric, nonpyloric, and nutritional therapies. Pyloric therapies such as botulinum toxin injection, stent placement, pyloroplasty, and pyloromyotomy specifically focus on pylorospasm as a therapeutic target. These interventions aim to reduce the pressure gradient across the pyloric sphincter, with a resultant improvement in gastric emptying. Nonpyloric therapies, such as venting gastrostomy and gastric electrical stimulation, are intended to improve symptoms. Nutritional therapies, such as feeding tube placement, aim to provide nutritional support.\\nSeveral endoscopic interventions have shown utility in improving the quality of life and symptoms of select patients with refractory gastroparesis. Methods to identify which patients are best suited for a specific treatment are not well established. Endoscopic pyloromyotomy is a relatively recent development that may prove to be the preferred pyloric-directed intervention, although additional and longer-term outcomes are needed. Recent studies have shown an increase in the incidence of gastric cancer (GC) among young adults in Asia and Latin America. However, it is unknown if a similar trend is happening in the United States.\\nA retrospective review of the National Cancer Database was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma between the years of 2004 and 2013.\\nA total of 93 734 patients were included. The two age groups below 40 did not see a change in GC incidence; however, age groups above 40 had increasing incidence. Patients aged 18 to 25 had the largest proportion of stage 4 disease and a poor survival (median 11.5 months), compared to older patients.\\nDespite the increasing trend of GC among individuals, the incidence of GC among young adults is not increasing. However, this subpopulation presents at more advanced stages (clinical stage 4) and thus has worse survival. To identify the association between the width of the gastric conduit and the benign anastomotic stricture (BAS) after esophagectomy with end-to-side cervical anastomosis for esophageal cancer.\\nPatients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy between July 2013 and July 2014 were included in this study. The gastric conduit was used for reconstruction in all patients and end-to-side cervical anastomosis were performed using a circular stapler. The patients were divided into a narrow group (3-5 cm) and a wide group (>5 cm) based on the gastric conduit width. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the possible factors (patients\\' age, gender, preoperative comorbidities, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, gastric conduit width, anastomotic leakage) that could affect the incidence of BAS.\\nTwo-hundred and one patients were included in this study. The median follow-up period was 29 months (17-58 months). Seven cases (3.5%) showed anastomotic leakage in the postoperative period and 38 patients (18.9%) developed BAS; all within the first year of follow-up. In univariate analysis, the width of the gastric conduit was the only risk factor for the development of BAS (odds ratio [OR] = 3.36, \\nA wide gastric conduit width (>5 cm) is an independent risk factor for the development of BAS after esophagectomy and stapled cervical end-to-side anastomosis for esophageal cancer. Uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis is widely used in gastrointestinal reconstruction procedure after radical gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer. However, the proximal jejunal closure point recanalization of the input loop is an important complication of postoperative patients with prolonged time, resulting in pancreatic juice or bile reflux, which can lead to inflammatory lesions of the remnant stomach or esophagus. Poor selection of the location of the closure point during anastomosis causes a large amount of food deposited in the blind loop to be pushed and impacted, resulting in loosened threads or failed U-shaped staples, which may cause recanalization complications. Most scholars believe that the shortening of the jejunal tube closure point to the optimal position of 2 to 3 cm from the residual gastrojejunostomy can significantly reduce food retention, decrease the pressure of the closure point and the incidence of recanalization. At present, the application of new anastomotic techniques and materials such as four-row and six-row U-shaped staples and 7# wire ligation under laparoscopy can prevent the occurrence of recanalization of the closure point. Uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis is safe and has few complications, and is expected to become one of the best ways of digestive tract reconstruction.\\n非离断（Uncut）Roux-en-Y吻合术是目前远端胃癌根治术后应用比较广泛的消化道重建术式。但是，其输入袢近端空肠闭合点再通是患者术后随时间延长而易出现的重要并发症，引起的胰液或胆汁反流，可导致残胃或食管发生炎性病变。吻合时闭合点位置选择不佳，使盲袢中大量沉积食物受到推挤冲击以及丝线松脱、U型缝钉脱落等因素，均可导致再通并发症的发生。多数学者认为，空肠管闭合点缩短至距残胃空肠吻合口2~3 cm处位置最佳，可明显减少食物滞留量，减轻闭合点压力，降低再通率。目前，腹腔镜下四排、六排U型缝钉和7号丝线束扎等新的吻合技术和材料的应用，可预防闭合点再通的发生，Uncut Roux-en-Y安全、并发症少，有望成为消化道重建的最佳方式之一。. The standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer remains surgery-based comprehensive treatment. The D2 radical surgery has made outstanding contributions to the standarlization of gastric cancer surgery, which has improved patients\\' prognosis and quality of life. In recent years, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has achieved a certain effect on the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. With the continuous development of the concept of membrane anatomy in gastric cancer surgery, new surgical challenges have also been raised. For patients after neoadjuvant therapy, there is heated controversy in the possibility of completing radical gastrectomy with membrane anatomical concept for gastric cancer. We believe that if neoadjuvant therapy pushes mesenteric cancer cell back into the mesentery, theoretically membrane anatomy combined with neoadjuvant therapy is beneficial to the treatment efficacy of advanced gastric cancer. However, membrane anatomy has two important problems when combined with neoadjuvant therapy: (1) After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there are varying degrees of edema around the stomach tissue, which will affect the visualization of anatomic planes. In addition, because the patients\\' coagulation function is damaged to a certain extent, it is difficult to avoid bleeding or minimize bleeding during the operation. Therefore, it is still controversial whether the patients with gastric cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can undergo radical gastrectomy with membrane anatomy. (2) For patients with complete pathological remission, whether to obtain the maximum rate of pathological remission through intensive neoadjuvant therapy, or to obtain the survival benefit of patients with membrane anatomy surgery in clinic is still controversial. Faced with these confusions, multi-center clinical researches on the application of membrane anatomy surgery after neoadjuvant therapy is the only solution.\\n进展期胃癌的标准治疗方式仍然是以手术为主的综合治疗，以D(2)根治术为代表的外科手术对规范胃癌的外科治疗，改善患者预后和生活质量等方面做出了突出的贡献。近年来，新辅助化疗对进展期胃癌的治疗取得一定的疗效，随着胃癌外科领域的膜解剖理念的不断发展，对胃癌的手术方式也提出了新的挑战。对于接受新辅助治疗后的胃癌患者，是否能够完成膜解剖胃癌根治术是当下值得探讨的热点问题之一。我们认为，如果新辅助治疗使系膜边癌推向系膜内，理论上膜解剖手术联合新辅助治疗是有利于提高进展期胃癌疗效的。但膜解剖在新辅助治疗患者中存在两个重要问题：（1）新辅助治疗胃癌患者术中胃周组织普遍存在不同程度的水肿，干扰到层次的解剖，由于患者凝血功能的破坏造成出血明显，很难达到\"微出血\"或者\"无血\"，因此，对于新辅助化疗后胃癌患者是否能够实施膜解剖的胃癌根治术，尚存争议；（2）对于病理完全缓解的患者，是否需要行膜解剖手术，临床中是通过强化新辅助治疗来获得最大的病理缓解率，还是以膜解剖手术获取患者的生存获益，尚存争议。开展膜解剖手术在新辅助治疗患者中应用的多中心临床研究是解决众多临床困惑的唯一途径。. D2 lymphadenectomy combined with complete mesentery excision (CME) for advanced gastric cancer in recent years was a hotspot issue in China, while its safety and effectiveness have been proved. According to the Membrane anatomy of the stomach, both surgical approach and mesogastrium interval is particularly important in Laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. We summarized and shared the following clinical experience for medical colleagues. (1) Lymph nodes of right abdominal aorta-No.7,8,9,12-should be resection as an indivisible whole. This integrity tissue above the portal vein was supposed to the end of the dorsal mesentery of stomach and the continuation of Gerota fascia. (2) No.10 (splenic hilar lymph nodes) lymphadenectomy: The surgical approach enters the Gerota fascia between the left gastric artery(LGA) and the left alongside the splenic artery. When the extent of lymphadenectomy performed to cardia and upper margin of the spleen, then the ultrasonic scalpel should excise the lymph node along the splenic artery to the splenic hilum. (3) Esophagogastric junctional cancer: There is no consensus over the type of resection and the extent of lymphadenectomy that could be a standard of care for this category.While we recommended that paraesophageal lymph node dissection and digestive tract reconstruction should be completed in 3D laparoscopy vision. (4) Infracardiac bursa(ICB): Intentional entry into the ICB provides surgeons with a landmark to identify the location of the pleura, and inferior vena cava. (5)The application of endoscopic aspirator with flushing and electrocautery. The CME concept of gastric cancer emphasizes the membrane anatomy theory rather than the regional lymph node. The precision and homogeneity of the D2 procedure therapy of gastric cancer depend on complete mesentery excision, standard the surgical process, or approach. Only in this way can we find the avascular gaps easily and perfectly cover the extent of lymph node dissection required for the D2 procedure.\\n近年来，腹腔镜D(2)+完整系膜切除术正逐步成为国内临床研究热点，其安全性、有效性已得到证实，系膜理论指导下手术入路的选择和膜间隙的寻找在腔镜手术中尤为重要，我们总结以下临床经验技巧，与同道分享：（1）No.7、No.8、No.9及No.12（腹主动脉右侧）淋巴结均位于胃背侧系膜的末端，其底部间隙为Gerota筋膜向上的延续、并走行于门静脉之前，其清扫应视为一个整体进行清扫。（2）在胃左动脉及脾动脉夹角左前方进入Gerota筋膜前方的间隙，游离到贲门胃底及脾脏的后缘，沿脾动脉游离至脾门，将大网膜尽量移至右侧腹腔，易暴露清扫脾门淋巴结。（3）对于食管胃结合部肿瘤，建议在3D腔镜明视下进行食管旁淋巴结清扫，且尽量在全腔镜下完成清扫及消化道重建。（4）心下囊的打开，有利于判断胸膜的位置及下纵隔淋巴结的清扫。（5）手术中应用可冲洗吸引电凝棒。强化膜解剖理论指导下的胃癌完整系膜切除理念，弱化淋巴结分组分站，真正做到整块系膜完整切除，规范流程及入路，更容易找到无血管分布的间隙，沿这一间隙游离，不仅能够完美覆盖D(2)根治要求的淋巴结清扫范围，而且能够保证手术的精准化和同质化。. Different from classical surgical anatomy which only pays attention to the morphology and structure of human organs, modern membrane anatomy focuses on not only the relationship between morphology and structure, but also the biological behavior characteristics of tumors. Membrane antomy is a theoretical system with interpretation on both the structural and disease function, so it has been accepted by more and more gastrointestinal surgeons. However, the theoretical system of gastric membrane anatomy is not mature yet. The stomach and its mesentery have undergone complex rotation and fusion in the process of embryonic development, so that surgeons have different understandings of the gastric membrane anatomy. Therefore, it is easy to cause various confusion and misunderstanding, resulting in deviations between the theory of membrane anatomy and the practice of surgery. In the present study, the mesentery of the stomach is divided into different regions, and the embryonic development process is traced back. The application and compromise encountered in the radical gastrectomy of gastric cancer will be expounded according to the membrane anatomy theory combined with the author\\'s experience of operation.\\n与仅仅关注人体器官组织形态结构的经典手术解剖学不同，现代膜解剖既关注形态结构关系及其如何发生，同时又关注肿瘤生物学行为特点，是从结构关系与疾病功能两方面进行整体解读的理论体系，因此得到诸多胃肠外科医生的认同。但胃的膜解剖理论体系尚未完善，胃及其系膜在胚胎发育过程中经历了复杂的旋转与融合，以致外科医生对胃的膜解剖的认识和理解各有不同，在实践中也存在各种混淆与误解，导致膜解剖的理论与手术实践产生偏差。本文将胃系膜分成不同区域，回溯胚胎发育过程，结合手术实践中的思考与理解，阐述膜解剖理论在胃癌根治术中的应用指导及实践妥协问题。. Patients with ductal adenocarcinoma in the body and/or tail of the pancreas with involvement of the common hepatic artery and/or celiac axis have until recently been considered unresectable. In selected cases, distal pancreatectomy (DP) with en bloc celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) may be an option to achieve R0 resection.\\nPatients with tumours in the body and/or tail of the pancreas locally advanced with involvement of the common hepatic artery and/or celiac axis, with no distant metastases, were evaluated for DP-CAR procedures. Preoperative embolization was performed 10-14\\xa0days prior to surgery to enhance collateral arterial supply for the liver and stomach.\\nA total of 21 patients went through DP-CAR of whom 15 were preoperatively embolized. R0 resection vas achieved in 76% of the patients comparable to our standard distal pancreatectomies. The DP-CAR patients had a significant longer postoperative hospital stay, but no difference in major complications, including pancreatic fistulas compared with our standard distal pancreatectomies. No 30 nor 90\\xa0days postoperative mortality were recorded. Median survival in patients who underwent DP and DP-CAR procedures was 24.0 and 23.5\\xa0months, respectively (P\\u2009>\\u20090.5).\\nOutcomes after DP-CAR are comparable to standard distal pancreatectomies. DP-CAR after preoperative embolization is feasible and may in selected patients be a good option for treating patients with tumours in the body and/or tail of the pancreas with central arterial involvement. Objectives Stomach cancer (SC) is one of the most common and deadly types of cancer. It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The effect of environmental and ecological factors in SC have been assessed in some studies. Thus, we aimed to synthesize the environmental and ecological factors of SC incidence and mortality. Content In this systematic review study, the scientific databases, including Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, were searched from inception to November 2019 for all primary articles written in English by using relevant Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) terms. Two independent authors conducted the screening process to decide on the eligibility and inclusion of the articles in the study. The\\xa0third author acted as an arbiter to resolve any disagreements. Summary and Outlook A total of 157 potentially relevant articles were identified from the initial search 38 of which met the eligibility criteria; finally, 34 articles were included in the systematic review. The results revealed that soil arsenic exposure, coal and other opencast mining installations, living near incinerators and installations for the recovery or disposal of hazardous waste, installations for the production of cement, lime, plaster, and magnesium oxide, proximity to a metal industry sources, dietary iron, ingested asbestos, farming, arsenic in soil, altitude, organochlorines and environmental exposure to cadmium and lead have positive associations with SC incidence or death. Most of the ecological and environmental factors such as living near the mineral industries, the disposal of hazardous waste, metal industry sources and environmental exposure to cadmium and lead are positively related to SC mortality and incidence. However, solar UV-B, heat index and dietary zinc can be taken into account as protective factors against SC mortality and incidence. S-1 plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin showed promising efficacy for treatment of advanced gastric cancer in a randomised phase 2 study. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral TAS-118 (S-1 plus leucovorin) and oxaliplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer.\\nWe did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in 62 centres across Japan and South Korea. Patients aged 20 years or older, with a histologically confirmed advanced gastric cancer with negative or unknown HER2 status, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, measurable or evaluable metastatic lesions, and no previous treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system using the minimisation method, stratified by performance status, presence of a measurable lesion, and country, to receive TAS-118 (S-1 40-60 mg and leucovorin 25 mg orally twice daily for 7 days) plus oxaliplatin (85 mg/m\\nBetween Jan 28, 2015, and Dec 5, 2016, 711 patients were randomised to TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin (n=356) or S-1 plus cisplatin (n=355). 11 untreated patients and 19 ineligible patients were excluded from the primary analysis (TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group n=347, S-1 plus cisplatin group n=334) following recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee. After median follow-up of 26·0 months (IQR 22·0-32·8), median overall survival was 16·0 months (95% CI 13·8-18·3) in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and 15·1 months (95% CI 13·6-16·4) in the S-1 plus cisplatin group (hazard ratio 0·83, 95% CI 0·69-0·99; p=0·039). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the 352 patients in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and the 348 patients in the S-1 plus cisplatin group were anaemia (56 [16%] vs 64 [18%]), neutropenia (54 [15%] vs 88 [25%]), decreased appetite (53 [15%] vs 46 [13%]), diarrhoea (33 [9%] vs 15 [4%]), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (30 [9%] vs one [<1%]). Serious adverse events were observed in 155 (44%) of 352 patients in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group and 159 (46%) of 348 patients in the S-1 plus cisplatin group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in the TAS-118 plus oxaliplatin group (pulmonary tuberculosis and viral pneumonia).\\nTAS-118 plus oxaliplatin showed a clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy compared with S-1 plus cisplatin, and could be considered a new first-line treatment option for advanced gastric cancer in Asian patients.\\nTaiho Pharmaceutical and Yakult Honsha. None This video case report presents a patient with an invasive pancreatic mass and a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery who underwent single-session endoscopic ultrasound-directed transgastric ERCP for tissue sampling and biliary stenting with subsequent maintenance of the newly established gastrogastrostomy. The demonstrated technique enables spectrum of endoscopic interventions in gastric bypass patients by facilitating a direct endoscopic passage through the reconnected stomach. Importantly, the method carries a risk of weight regain by essentially reversing the bypass. However, this can be an actual desire in selected cases, e.g., oncologic patients, making it a favorable choice over other alternatives.  To investigate whether there is a distinct difference in prognosis between hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS) and non-hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (non-HAS) and whether HAS can benefit from radical surgery.\\nWe retrospectively reviewed 722 patients with non-HAS and 75 patients with HAS who underwent radical gastrectomy between 3 November 2009 and 17 December 2018. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to eliminate the bias among the patients in our study. The relationships between gastric cancer type and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.\\nOur data demonstrate that there was no statistically significant difference in the OS between HAS and non-HAS {K-M, P\\u2009=\\u2009log rank (Mantel-Cox), (before PSM P\\u2009=\\u20090.397); (1:1 PSM P\\u2009=\\u20090.345); (1:2 PSM P\\u2009=\\u20090.195)}. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the 1-, 2-, or 3-year survival rates between patients with non-HAS and patients with HAS (before propensity matching, after 1:1 propensity matching, and after 1:2 propensity matching).\\nHAS was generally considered to be an aggressive gastric neoplasm, but its prognosis may not be as unsatisfactory as previously believed.  Nexrutine, an herbal extract of Phellodendron amurense, has been found to play a tumor-suppressive role in many cancers. However, its role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer remains unclear.\\nGastric cancer cells (SGC-7901 and MGC-803) were treated with nexrutine, and cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were analyzed. And the MGC-803 cells-derived xenograft mouse models were fed pelleted diet containing 600\\xa0mg/kg nexrutine for 21\\xa0days after inoculation. Mechanically, we focused on the influences of nexrutine on the levels and activation of STAT3 and NF-κB as well as their upstream regulator FAK. Additionally, we further verified whether nexrutine affected the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells via FAK by upregulating FAK expression before nexrutine treatment.\\nWe found nexrutine inhibited the viability, invasion, and expression levels of PCNA, CyclinD1 and Bcl-2, promoted the apoptosis and Bax expression, decreased levels of STAT3, phospho-STAT3, NF-κB p65, phospho-p65, FAK and phospho-FAK in gastric cancer cells. Overexpression of FAK reversed the impacts of nexrutine on the levels of STAT3, phospho-STAT3, NF-κB p65, phospho-p65, as well as the malignant characteristics of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, nexrutine suppressed tumor volumes and weights, and decreased expression and phosphorylation of FAK, STAT3 and NF-κB p65 in vivo.\\nNexrutine inhibited the malignant progression of gastric cancer via negatively regulating STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathway by suppressing FAK expression and activation. Bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis from advanced solid tumors. Bone metastasis is a leading cause of pain and increases the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) in cancer patients. In addition to affecting the quality of life, it also increases the medical costs and mortality risk. We aimed to examine the occurrence of bone metastasis and SREs in Korean cancer patients using a nationwide health database. Using claims data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2013), we extracted the data of bone metastasis patients diagnosed with any of the seven major cancers in Korea from January 2002 to December 2010. Selected SREs included pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy, and palliative bone surgery. We used time-to-event analysis to estimate patient survival after bone metastasis. A total of 21,562 newly diagnosed cancer patients were identified; bone metastases developed in 1,849 patients (breast cancer, 18.8%; prostate cancer, 17.5%; lung cancer, 13.7%). The median time from primary cancer diagnosis to bone metastasis was 18.9 months. The cumulative incidence of SREs was 45.1% in all bone metastasis patients. The most common cancer type was lung cancer (53.4%), followed by liver (50.9%), prostate (45.9%), breast (43.6%), and colorectal (40.2%) cancers. Almost all SREs developed 1 month after bone metastasis, except in patients with breast and prostate cancers (median: 5.9 months in breast cancer and 4.7 months in prostate cancer). Survival duration after the development of bone metastasis was < 6 months in stomach, liver, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. Breast and prostate cancer patients survived for > 1 year after the occurrence of SREs. This study reveals the epidemiology of bone metastasis and SREs in Korean cancer patients, and the findings can be used to assess the actual bone health status of cancer patients. At present, the gastric tube is the first choice for esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy for various benign and malignant diseases. However, when the stomach is not available, a pedicled jejunum or colon is used to reconstruct the esophagus. The present study aimed to compare the postoperative outcomes and quality of life of patients receiving jejunal and colonic conduits.\\nIn the present retrospective study, the clinical data of 71 patients with esophageal carcinoma, who received jejunal reconstruction (jejunum group, n\\u2009=\\u200934) and colonic reconstruction (colon group, n\\u2009=\\u200937) from 2005 to 2015, were compared.\\nCompared with the colon group, the jejunum group had a lower incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage, lesser duration of postoperative drainage, and faster recovery. Furthermore, the scores were better in the jejunum group than in the colon group, in terms of short-term overall quality of life, physical function and social relationships. Moreover, the jejunal group had a significantly lower frequency of pH <\\u20094 simultaneous reflux time\\u2009>\\u20095\\u2009min (N45) and the longest reflux time (LT) at 24\\u2009weeks after surgery.\\nIn esophageal cancer, when gastric tube construction is not feasible, a pedicled jejunum may be preferred over a colonic conduit due to lower incidence of acid reflux, anastomotic leakage and higher postoperative short-term quality of life, and rapid postoperative recovery. Cutaneous side effects associated with sunitinib use are a major problem in patients receiving cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) against possible skin damage resulting from sunitinib use in rats. Thirty Albino Winstar rats were divided into the following three groups: healthy controls (HCs,  The term neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) encompasses a molecularly and biologically very heterogeneous group of tumors, which have in common their origin in neuroendocrine cells. The also very heterogeneous subgroup of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN) is the best classified and investigated group. This article provides a systematic review of the current classification, diagnostics and treatment options of GEP-NEN. In order to achieve a better overview, it was consciously decided not to use an approach based on the primary localization. Instead, a thematic organization according to classification, clinical phenotype, diagnostics and treatment was chosen. To investigate the performance of a\\xa0knowledge-based RapidPlan, for optimisation of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans applied to hepatocellular cancer (HCC) patients.\\nA\\xa0cohort of 65\\xa0patients was retrospectively selected: 50\\xa0were used to \"train\" the model, while the remaining 15\\xa0provided independent validation. The performance of the RapidPlan model was benchmarked against manual optimisation and was also compared to volumetric modulated arc therapy (RapidArc) photon plans. A\\xa0subanalysis appraised the performance of the RapidPlan model applied to patients with lesions ≤300\\u202fcm\\nThere was an equivalence between manual plans and RapidPlan-optimised IMPT plans, which outperformed the RapidArc plans. The planning dose-volume objectives were met on average for all structures except for D\\nA\\xa0knowledge-based RapidPlan model was trained and validated for IMPT. The results demonstrate that RapidPlan can be trained adequately for IMPT in HCC. The quality of the RapidPlan-based plans is at least equivalent compared to what is achievable with manual planning. RapidPlan also confirmed the potential to optimise the quality of the proton therapy results, thus reducing the impact of operator planning skills on patient results. To stratify the postsurgical computed tomography (CT) surveillance based on a risk-scoring system for predicting extragastric recurrence after surgical resection of early gastric cancer (EGC).\\nPostsurgical CT surveillance should not be routinely performed in all patients because of the low incidence of extragastric recurrence and potential risk of radiation exposure.\\nData from 3162 patients who underwent surgical resection for EGC were reviewed to develop a risk-scoring system to predict extragastric recurrence. Risk scores were based on the predictive factors for extragastric recurrence, which were determined using Cox proportional hazard regression model. The risk-scoring system was validated by Uno censoring adjusted C-index. External validation was performed using an independent dataset (n = 430).\\nThe overall incidence of extragastric recurrence was 1.4% (44/3162). Five risk factors (lymph node metastasis, indications for endoscopic resection, male sex, positive lymphovascular invasion, and elevated macroscopic type), which were significantly associated with extragastric recurrence, were incorporated into the risk-scoring system, and the patients were categorized into 2 risk groups. The 10-year extragastric recurrence-free survival differed significantly between low- and high-risk groups (99.7% vs 96.5%; P < 0.001). The predictive accuracy of the risk-scoring system in the development cohort was 0.870 [Uno C-index; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.800-0.939]. Discrimination was good after internal (0.859) and external validation (0.782, 0.549-1.000).\\nThis risk-scoring system might be useful to predict extragastric recurrence of EGC after curative surgical resection. We suggest that postsurgical CT surveillance to detect extragastric recurrence should be avoided in the low-risk group. Pulmonary microvascular tumor embolism (PMTE), pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM), and lymphangitis carcinomatosis (LC) have an intricate pathophysiology and usually occur with cancers of breast, stomach, and lung. Microvascular pulmonary metastases attributable to cervical cancer are a rarity. Clinical presentation and autopsy findings of patients with microvascular pulmonary metastases in cervical cancers were studied with a review of literature. Four patients (mean age of 55.5 years) with carcinoma cervix showed microvascular metastases. Three of whom presented with respiratory symptoms, and the fourth case was unresponsive on presentation. Each patient succumbed to their illness shortly after admission. Autopsy examination performed on each patient depicted varying combination of PMTE, PTTM, and LC, all with squamous histology. This case series highlights the rare association of carcinoma cervix with the aforementioned microvascular phenomena. Besides, it underscores the sequential mechanism of occurrence of microvascular pulmonary metastasis and the associated guarded prognosis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of gastric cancer (GC). The aim of this study was to construct the prognostic predictive model of lncRNAs signature and improve the survival prediction of GC.\\nThe expression profiling of lncRNAs in large GC cohorts was performed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases using the lncRNAs-mining approach, including training data set (N=160) and testing data set (N=159). A 13-lncRNAs signature significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in the training data set was selected. The prognostic value of this 13-lncRNAs signature was then confirmed in the test validation set and the entire validation set, respectively.\\nBased on lncRNA expression profiling of 319 patients with stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), prognostic 13-lncRNAs signature was found to be significantly associated with the prognosis of GC. Compared to patients with low-risk scores, patients with high-risk scores had a significantly shorter survival time. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis indicated that this 13-lncRNAs signature was potentially involved in multiple biological processes, such as DNA replication and cell cycle signaling pathway.\\nThe prognostic model of the 13-lncRNAs signature established by our study could improve the survival prediction of GC to a greater extent. Therapies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have become a focus for improving treatment outcomes in patients with gastric cancer. This literature review sought to assesses clinical outcomes, including safety, survival, and treatment outcomes, of patients who received trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic gastric cancer.\\nSearches were conducted in PubMed and Embase to identify observational research studies investigating the clinical outcomes of trastuzumab and combination therapies for the treatment of HER2+ metastatic gastric cancer, published January 1, 2014-August 22, 2019. Article screening was a two-phase process, and the results of each screening level were documented in accordance with PRISMA.\\nTwenty articles met the selection criteria for data extraction. Studies focused on treatment patterns or survival, safety, and clinical outcomes, as well as the natural history of disease. In the combined HER2+ patient populations included in this review, tumors were located in the stomach (33.7%), gastroesophageal junction (GEJ, 14.2%), unspecific GEJ or stomach (50.3%), or esophagus (1.9%). Studies observed increases in both overall survival and progression-free survival with the use of trastuzumab-based chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy treatment alone. Additionally, trastuzumab-based chemotherapy appeared to improve survival and clinical outcomes regardless of the presence of multi-organ metastases or tumor location.\\nTrastuzumab-treated patients have longer survival times than those not treated with trastuzumab and tolerate treatment well, with few serious adverse events. New treatments for second- and subsequent-line therapies would increase regimen options.\\nThe treatment patterns and clinical outcomes observed in this literature review suggest patients treated with trastuzumab have longer survival times compared with chemotherapy treatment alone and tolerate treatment. The systematic collection of data on cancer is being performed by various population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) and hospital-based cancer registries (HBCRs) across India under the National Cancer Registry Programme-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research of Indian Council of Medical Research since 1982.\\nThis study examined the cancer incidence, patterns, trends, projections, and mortality from 28 PBCRs and also the stage at presentation and type of treatment of patients with cancer from 58 HBCRs (N = 667,666) from the pooled analysis for the composite period 2012-2016. Time trends in cancer incidence rate were generated as annual percent change from 16 PBCRs (those with a minimum of 10 years of continuous good data available) using Joinpoint regression.\\nAizawl district (269.4) and Papumpare district (219.8) had the highest age-adjusted incidence rates among males and females, respectively. The projected number of patients with cancer in India is 1,392,179 for the year 2020, and the common 5 leading sites are breast, lung, mouth, cervix uteri, and tongue. Trends in cancer incidence rate showed an increase in all sites of cancer in both sexes and were high in Kamrup urban (annual percent change, 3.8%; \\nThis study provides a framework for assessing the status and trends of cancer in India. It shall guide appropriate support for action to strengthen efforts to improve cancer prevention and control to achieve the national noncommunicable disease targets and the sustainable development goals. The reliable method to stratify the gastric cancer risk after Helicobacter pylori eradication remains an elusive goal.\\nMass eradication of H.\\xa0pylori began in 2004 in a high-risk population. After eradication, a screening program involving first-stage serological tests (pepsinogen-I, pepsinogen-II, H.\\xa0pylori immunoglobin G, and gastrin-17) and second-stage endoscopic examination was launched in 2015-2018. Index lesions included gastric cancer or extensive premalignant lesions. We evaluated the performance of the serological tests to \"rule in\" and \"rule out\" the risk based on positive and negative likelihood ratios, respectively. The methylation levels of microRNA-124a-3 in the stomach were measured to indicate genetic damage.\\nAmong 6512 invited subjects, 3895 (59.6%) participated. Both gastrin-17 and pepsinogen tests were normal in 3560 (91.4%) subjects; 206 (5.3%) gastrin-17 and 129 (3.3%) pepsinogen tests were abnormal. Years after eradication, the severity of gastritis had fallen greatly, and extensive premalignant lesions or gastric cancer frequently occurred in newly non-atrophic-appearing mucosa. Pepsinogen testing could moderately predict atrophic gastritis (positive likelihood ratio: 4.11 [95% confidence interval: 2.92-5.77]; negative likelihood ratio: 0.14 [0.10-0.19]). Gastrin-17 was not useful (0.66 and 1.20, respectively). However, pepsinogen testing poorly predicted the index lesions (2.04 [1.21-3.42] and 0.57 [0.34-0.95]). DNA methylation levels in the post-eradication mucosa were more discriminative for predicting index lesions (3.89 [2.32-6.54] and 0.25 [0.15-0.42]).\\nAfter eradication, pepsinogen false-negative results become more frequent because histology is improved but genetic damage may persist. Direct testing for genetic damage offers better discrimination. The importance of targeted therapy and interest in the study of predictive markers in gastric cancer (GC) have increased in recent years with the use of anti-HER2 therapy and immunotherapy with anti-PD1/PD-L1 for microsatellite instability (MSI) and PD-L1\\u2009+\\u2009tumors. However, the behavior of remnant GC (RGC) in this scenario is poorly reported. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of RGC and its association with the expression of current markers for targeted therapy.\\nAll RGC resections performed in a single center from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. As a comparison group, 53 primary proximal GC (PGC) who underwent total D2-gastrectomy were selected. HER2, MSI status and PD-L1 expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Combined Positive Score (CPS) was used to determine PD-L1 positivity.\\nA total of 40 RGC were included. RGC patients were older (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), had lower BMI (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and number of resected lymph nodes (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) compared to the PGC. Regarding markers expression, MSI was higher in RGC than PGC (27.5% vs 9.4%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.022). The frequency of CPS-positive was 32.5% and 26.4% in RGC and PGC, respectively (p\\u2009=\\u20090.522). HER2 positivity was 17.5% and 22.6% for RGC and PGC, respectively (p\\u2009=\\u20090.543). In survival analysis, DFS was better for RGC CPS-positive than RGC CPS-negative (p\\u2009=\\u20090.039) patients. There was no difference in survival considering MSI status.\\nRGC had higher incidence of MSI than PGC, and CPS-positive RGC was associated with better survival. The immunological profile of RGC patients suggests that they would be good candidates for immunotherapy. We present the case of a 55-year-old man who was admitted with new abdominal ascites and change in stool caliber. The colonoscopy examination revealed a severe stricture with inflamed friable mucosa measuring 8 cm in length in the rectosigmoid colon. Histologically, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells was seen. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which was suggestive of linitis plastica of the stomach. On microscopic examination, biopsy reported poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with occasional signet ring cells as the primary source. Mesenchymal tumors driven by NTRK fusions are clinically and morphologically heterogeneous. With an increasing number of clinicopathological entities being associated with NTRK fusions, the diagnostic and predictive value of the identification of NTRK fusions is uncertain. Recently, mesenchymal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract with NTRK fusions were described as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), but the nosology of such neoplasms remains controversial. We report eight mesenchymal tumors involving the gastrointestinal tract with NTRK1 or NTRK3 rearrangements. The tumors occurred in six children and two adults, five males and three females (age range 2 months-55 years; median 3.5\\u2009years), and involved the small intestine (n\\u2009=\\u20094), stomach (n\\u2009=\\u20092), rectum (n\\u2009=\\u20091), and mesentery (n\\u2009=\\u20091). Clinical outcomes were variable, ranging from relatively indolent (n\\u2009=\\u20092) to aggressive diseases (n\\u2009=\\u20092). Morphologically, the tumors were heterogeneous and could be classified in the following three groups: (1) infantile fibrosarcoma involving the gastrointestinal tract (n\\u2009=\\u20094), enriched for NTRK3 fusions; (2) low-grade CD34-positive, S100 protein-positive spindle-cell tumors, associated with NTRK1 fusions (n\\u2009=\\u20092); and (3) unclassified high-grade spindle-cell sarcomas, with NTRK1 fusions (n\\u2009=\\u20092). By immunohistochemistry, the tumors demonstrated diffuse pan-TRK expression, of variable intensity, and lacked a specific line of differentiation. Four cases expressed CD34, which was coexpressed with S100 protein in three cases. Expression of SOX10, KIT, and DOG1 was consistently absent. Molecular genetic testing identified TPM3-NTRK1 (n\\u2009=\\u20093), TPR-NTRK1, LMNA-NTRK1, and ETV6-NTRK3 (n\\u2009=\\u20092), and SPECC1L-NTRK3 in-frame gene fusions. We conclude that the evaluation of mesenchymal spindle-cell neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract without a definitive line of differentiation should include interrogation of NTRK alterations, particularly in pediatric patients. Mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract with NTRK rearrangements are clinically and morphologically heterogeneous, and few, if any, seem related to GIST. A 57-year-old man visited our hospital for evaluation of an abnormal shadow identified on chest radiography. Chest computed tomography findings suggested diffuse bone metastases in the thoracic spine and the bilateral ribs. Notably, 18- fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed no evidence of the primary tumor. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a small flat depressed lesion in the greater curvature of the gastric angle. Histopathological examination of this specimen revealed a signet-ring cell carcinoma. Histopathological examination of a biopsy obtained from the right iliac bone revealed a signet-ring cell carcinoma similar to that observed in the gastric mucosa. He was diagnosed with a gastric signetring cell carcinoma with multiple bone and bone marrow metastases. Cervical metastases caused gradual worsening of respiratory functions, necessitating artificial ventilation. He died of sudden ventricular tachycardia on the 36th day. Clinicians should be aware of the features of primary gastric cancer with bone and bone marrow metastases for early diagnosis and prompt treatment. A 79-year-old man presented to our hospital with 1-month history of discomfort on swallowing and pain in the thoracodorsal region. Image investigation revealed a tumor lesion affecting the area from the lower esophagus to the gastric antrum, and small cell carcinoma of esophagus was diagnosed based on biopsy. He was treated with resection of the lower esophagus and the upper part of the stomach and a postoperative chemoradiotherapy. The patient follow-upwas without recurrence until a malignant lymphoma developed 4 years and 5 months after the surgery. Chemotherapy was provided for the malignant lymphoma, however, the patient died 6 years and 4 months after the surgery for small cell carcinoma of esophagus. Small cell endocrine carcinoma of the esophagus is a relatively rare disease and its prognosis is poor. In our patient, long-term survival was achieved with multimodal treatment, however malignant lymphoma developed during the follow-upp eriod. This is the second case of metachronous cancer after the treatment for small cell carcinoma of the esophagus in Japan, and it is considered to be extremely rare. Fifty percent of the world\\'s population surves as a host for Helicobacter pylori, gastric cancer causing bacteria, that colonizes the gastric region of digestive tract. It has a remarkable capacity to infect the host stomach for the entire lifetime despite an activated host immune response.\\nIn this study, we have performed the virtual screening analysis of protein-inhibitor binding between the glycosyl transferase enzymes of Helicobacter pylori (CapJ or HP0421) and a corresponding library of inhibitors in the known substrate-binding pockets. We have docked our library of ligands consisting of cholesterol backbone with CapJ protein and identified several ligands\\' interacting amino acid residues present in active site pocket(s) of the protein.\\nIn most of the cases, the ligands showed an interaction with the residues of the same pocket of the enzyme. Top three (03) hits were filtered out from the whole data set, which might act as potent inhibitors of the enzyme-substrate reaction.\\nThis study describes a new possibility by which colonization of H. pylori can be limited. The reported evidence suggests that comprehensive knowledge and wet laboratory validation of these inhibitors are needed in order to develop them as lead molecules. Claudin 18 (CLDN18) is a transmembrane protein that localizes to apical regions to form tight junction complexes. Abnormal expression of   Most gastric cancer patients are diagnosed at mid- to late-stage and lose the chance of radical surgery, medical treatment is especially important to prolong the survival of patients. Apatinib mesylate, which is a small molecule vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could be used as antiangiogenesis therapy for gastric cancer.\\nA 67-year-old man sought medical care for upper abdominal discomfort.\\nThe patient was diagnosed as mixed medullary differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemistry suggested HER-2 (2+).\\nThe patient received chemotherapy consisting of oxaliplatin combined with S-1 as first-line treatment, and targeted therapy with apatinib mesylate as second-line treatment.\\nAfter 4 months of first-line chemotherapy, the patient received apatinib treatment immediately at a dose of 500\\u200amg/d orally and died of cardiac arrest with 8.5 months of overall survival. During this period of targeted therapy with apatinib mesylate, this male patient suffered mammary gland development besides other common adverse reactions.\\nThis case report is the first to report the case of male mammary gland development after oral apatinib. The infiltration of immune cells is a hallmark of most forms of malignancy. It is well known that in Tumor Microenvironment (TME), monocytes undergo reprogramming process to differentiate into Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) (M2 macrophages). Interestingly, this reprogramming process depends on signals provided by tumors. Hence, tumors from several tissues are infiltrated by functionally distinct TAMs populations. Tumor Protein p53(TP53) plays a role in the regulation or progression of DNA damage and repair through multiple mechanisms of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and genomic stability. Although, TP53 acts as a physiological break for M2 macrophages polarization; the potential regulatory function of TP53 in the infiltration of macrophages is still unknown. We used the Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) clinical data from 10,009 samples across 30 types of cancer via the Tumor IMmune Estimation Tool (TIMER) (https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/) to investigate whether TP53 status has an important clinical outcome on macrophages infiltration in different cancer types. Our analysis of TCGA showed that Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma (OV) patients with mutant TP53 had significantly higher macrophages infiltration than those with wild-type TP53 (P-value\\xa0<\\xa00.05) and poor prognosis associated. In contrast, Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients with wild-type TP53 had considerably higher macrophages infiltration than those with mutant TP53 (P-value\\xa0<\\xa00.01) and poor clinical outcomes. Herein, our study sheds light on the novel clinical role of TP53 in macrophages infiltration in TME of OV and STAD patients. Furthermore, the modulation of TP53 and its co-regulators may serve as promising targets for OV and STAD patients. In an international comparison of recent mortality statistics among G7 countries, Japan had the longest average life expectancy, primarily due to remarkably low mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and cancer (particularly breast and prostate). As recently as the 1960s, life expectancy in Japan was the shortest among the G7 countries, owing to relatively high mortality from cerebrovascular disease-particularly intracerebral hemorrhage-and stomach cancer. Mortality rates for these diseases subsequently decreased significantly while the already low rates for ischemic heart disease and cancer also decreased, resulting in Japanese life expectancy becoming the longest. The low mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and cancer are thought to reflect the low prevalence of obesity in Japan; low intake of red meat, specifically saturated fatty acids; and high intakes of fish, specifically n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, plant foods such as soybeans, and nonsugar-sweetened beverages such as green tea. The decreasing mortality rates from cerebrovascular disease are thought to reflect the increases in animal foods, milk, and dairy products and consequently in saturated fatty acids and calcium, together with a decrease in salt intake which may have led to a decrease in blood pressure. This decrease in salt and highly salted foods also seems to account for the decrease in stomach cancer. The typical Japanese diet as characterized by plant food and fish as well as modest Westernized diet such as meat, milk and dairy products might be associated with longevity in Japan. Oxidative stress is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal diseases. Sulforaphane (SFN), a bioactive compound found in cruciferous vegetables, activates the redox-sensitive nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). In addition to its protective role, SFN exerts cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. However, there is a lack of information concerning the toxicity of SFN in normal cells. We investigated the effects of SFN on cell viability, antioxidant defenses, and gene expression in human stomach mucosa cells (MNP01). SFN reduced ROS formation and protected the cells against induced oxidative stress but high concentrations increased apoptosis. An intermediate SFN concentration (8 μM) was chosen for RNA sequencing studies. We observed upregulation of genes of the NRF2 (antioxidant) pathway, the DNA damage response, and apoptosis signaling; whereas SFN downregulated cell cycle and DNA repair pathway genes. SFN may be cytoprotective at low concentrations and cytotoxic at high concentrations. Gastric cancer is one of the four most common cancer that causing death worldwide. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have shown that genetic diversities MUC1 (Mucin 1) and PSCA (Prostate Stem Cell Antigen) genes are involved in gastric cancer. The aim of this study was avaluating the association of rs4072037G\\u2009>\\u2009A polymorphism in MUC1 and rs2294008 C\\u2009>\\u2009T in PSCA gene with risk of gastric cancer in northern Iran.\\nDNA was extracted from 99 formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of gastric cancer and 96 peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals (sex matched) as controls. Two desired polymorphisms, 5640G\\u2009>\\u2009A and 5057C\\xa0>\\u2009T for MUC1 and PSCA genes were genotyped using PCR-RFLP method.\\nThe G allele at rs4072037 of MUC1 gene was associated with a significant decreased gastric cancer risk (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.507, 95% CI: 0.322-0.799, p\\u2009=\\u20090.003). A significant decreased risk of gastric cancer was observed in people with either AG vs. AA, AG\\u2009+\\u2009AA vs. GG and AA+GG vs. AG genotypes of MUC1 polymorphism (OR\\u2009=\\u20094.296, 95% CI: 1.190-15.517, p\\u2009=\\u20090.026), (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.726, 95% CI: 2.033-6.830, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0001) and (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.223, 95% CI: 0.120-0.413, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0001) respectively. Finally, there was no significant association between the PSCA 5057C\\u2009>\\u2009T polymorphism and risk of gastric cancer in all genetic models.\\nResults indicated that the MUC1 5640G\\u2009>\\u2009A polymorphism may have protective effect for gastric cancer in the Northern Iran population and could be considered as a potential molecular marker in gastric cancer.  Around 40% of cancers occur in working-age adults. Improvements in screening and treatment mean that most are expected to live years beyond their diagnosis. However, many experience persistent impairments from treatment such as fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and emotional distress. Work is a key occupation for this population and is an important occupational performance area for occupational therapy intervention. However, little is understood about working with cancer in the Australian context.\\nTo pilot a survey to identify factors associated with work participation among cancer survivors, and to determine if the survey collected useful information to build on for further study.\\nA cross-sectional online survey was developed to measure work participation and factors associated with successful work. Study participants aged 20-65\\xa0years, employed at diagnosis, with basic English and computer literacy were recruited from a cancer clinic in Western Sydney over a 3-month period.\\nNineteen survey responses were received and analysed. Participants had returned or remained at work (n\\xa0=\\xa09, 47.4%), unsuccessfully attempted to return to work (RTW; n\\xa0=\\xa02, 10.5%), or were on leave from work (n\\xa0=\\xa08, 42.1%). Of those on leave, most did not plan to RTW (n\\xa0=\\xa06, 31.6%). Fatigue (n\\xa0=\\xa015, 78.9%), difficulty concentrating (n\\xa0=\\xa08, 42.1%), memory issues (n\\xa0=\\xa08, 42.1%), stomach upset (n\\xa0=\\xa07, 36.8%), sleep disturbance, (n\\xa0=\\xa07, 36.8%), and psychological distress (n\\xa0=\\xa07, 36.8%) impacted perceived work ability. Physically demanding work (n\\xa0=\\xa08, 42.1%), length of the workday (n\\xa0=\\xa06, 31.6%), productivity demands (n\\xa0=\\xa05, 26.3%), and commuting (n\\xa0=\\xa04, 21.1%) were challenging to manage after cancer. A supportive workplace was a facilitator for work.\\nCancer survivors in Western Sydney may face challenges engaging in work after treatment. Work participation may be influenced by side effects of treatment, difficulty performing work demands, and the work environment. Services may be needed for cancer survivors to navigate RTW.  None Orally administered anticancer drugs facilitate treatment, but the acidic conditions in the stomach often challenge their availability. PhenolaTi is a Ti(IV)-based non-toxic anticancer drug with marked in-vivo efficacy. We report that nanoformulation protects phenolaTi from decomposition in stomach-like conditions. This is evidenced by similar NMR characteristics and similar in-vitro cytotoxicity toward murine (CT-26) and human (HT-29) colon cancer cells before and after incubation of nanoformulated phenolaTi (phenolaTi-F) at pH = 2, unlike results with the unformulated form of the complex. Furthermore, administration of phenolaTi-F in animal drinking water revealed a notable inhibition of tumor growth in Balb/c and immune-deficient (Nude) mice inoculated with CT-26 and HT-29 cells, respectively. In-vivo efficacy was at least similar to that of the corresponding intraperitoneal treatment with phenolaTi-F and the clinically employed oral drug, capecitabine. No body weight loss or clinical signs of toxicity were evident in the phenolaTi-F treated animals. These findings demonstrate a new mode of cancer treatment by safe titanium-based drugs. Endoscopic examination of gastric atrophy has been developed to determine the extent of atrophy by identifying the atrophic border of gastric mucosa, but its value in predicting the risk of developing gastric neoplasms is not quantified. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the incidence risk of gastric neoplasms on the basis of endoscopic grading of gastric atrophy.\\nTwo authors independently searched the electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) from inception through December 31, 2019, without language restriction. The effect size on study outcomes is calculated using random-effects model and presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity, publication bias, and quality of included studies were also assessed.\\nFourteen retrospective studies are identified to perform systematic review and meta-analysis, 11 were cohort studies, and three were cross-sectional research. The pooled RR for developing gastric neoplasms is 3.89 (95% CI 2.92-5.17) among general patients with severe endoscopic atrophy. For patients who underwent endoscopic resection for early gastric neoplasms, nearly two times increased risk of synchronous or metachronous neoplasms is pooled (RR\\xa0=\\xa01.96, 95% CI 1.39-2.75). In terms of the type of endoscopic atrophy, patients with open-type endoscopic atrophy have a higher risk of gastric cancer development (RR\\xa0=\\xa07.27; 95% CI 1.64-32.33) than those with close type.\\nGrading endoscopic atrophy according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification can assess the risk of gastric neoplasia development. Patients with severe or open-type endoscopic gastric atrophy at baseline should undergo rigorous surveillance to early detect premalignant lesions and cancer.  Intestinal metaplasia (IM) increases the risk of gastric cancer. Our previous results indicated that bile acids (BAs) reflux promotes gastric IM development through kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2) activation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Herein, we verified that secondary BAs responsive G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5) was increased significantly in IM specimens. Moreover, TGR5 contributed to deoxycholic acid (DCA)-induced metaplastic phenotype through positively regulating KLF4 and CDX2 at transcriptional level. Then we employed PCR array and identified hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) as a candidate mediator. Mechanically, DCA treatment could induce HNF4α expression through TGR5 and following ERK1/2 pathway activation. Furthermore, HNF4α mediated the effects of DCA treatment through directly regulating KLF4 and CDX2. Finally, high TGR5 levels were correlated with high HNF4α, KLF4, and CDX2 levels in IM tissues. These findings highlight the TGR5-ERK1/2-HNF4α axis during IM development in patients with BAs reflux, which may help to understand the mechanism underlying IM development and provide prospective strategies for IM treatment. Gastric cancer is the world\\'s third most lethal malignancy. Most gastric cancers develop through precancerous states of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. Two staging systems, operative link for gastritis assessment (OLGA) and operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia assessment (OLGIM), have been developed to detect high gastric cancer risk. European guidelines recommend surveillance for high-risk OLGA/OLGIM patients (stages III-IV), and for those with advanced stage of atrophic gastritis in the whole stomach mucosa. We hypothesize, that by combining atrophy and intestinal metaplasia into one staging named TAIM, more patients with increased gastric cancer risk could be detected.\\nTo evaluate the clinical value of the OLGA, OLGIM, and novel TAIM stagings as prognostic indicators for gastric cancer.\\nIn the Helsinki Gastritis Study, 22346 elderly male smokers from southwestern Finland were screened for serum pepsinogen I (PGI). Between the years 1989 and 1993, men with low PGI values (PGI < 25 μg/L), were invited to undergo an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. In this retrospective cohort study, 1147 men that underwent gastroscopy were followed for gastric cancer for a median of 13.7 years, and a maximum of 27.3 years. We developed a new staging system, TAIM, by combining the topography with the severity of atrophy or intestinal metaplasia in gastric biopsies. In TAIM staging, the gastric cancer risk is classified as low or high.\\nTwenty-eight gastric cancers were diagnosed during the follow-up, and the incidence rate was 1.72 per 1000 patient-years. The cancer risk associated positively with TAIM [Hazard ratio (HR) 2.70, 95%CI: 1.09-6.69, \\nOLGIM and TAIM stagings show prognostic value in assessing gastric cancer risk in elderly male smokers with atrophic gastritis. Screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy of a 65-year-old man revealed a 4.7-cm polypoid in the gastric high body. Clinical and laboratory findings, including serum gastrin level (460 pg/mL) and biopsy findings, were consistent with a diagnosis of type I neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Histologically, the mass consisted of dilated tortuous glands at the surface and grade 1 NET in deeper tissue. Some hyperplastic glands exhibited a transition to adenocarcinoma, which invaded the NET, simulating a \"tumor in tumor\" appearance. Next-generation sequencing revealed that the adenocarcinoma component harbored a TP53 mutation, whereas the NET component showed no pathogenic mutation. To our knowledge, this unusual collision of adenocarcinoma and NET within a single gastric hyperplastic polyp has not been previously described. This case suggests that large gastric hyperplastic polyps should be carefully examined because of the possibility of underlying NET and malignant transformation of surface epithelium. Segmentation of organs-at-risk (OARs) is a weak link in radiotherapeutic treatment planning process because the manual contouring action is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This work aimed to develop a deep learning-based method for rapid and accurate pancreatic multi-organ segmentation that can expedite the treatment planning process.\\nWe retrospectively investigated one hundred patients with computed tomography (CT) simulation scanned and contours delineated. Eight OARs including large bowel, small bowel, duodenum, left kidney, right kidney, liver, spinal cord and stomach were the target organs to be segmented. The proposed three-dimensional (3D) deep attention U-Net is featured with a deep attention strategy to effectively differentiate multiple organs. Performance of the proposed method was evaluated using six metrics, including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, specificity, Hausdorff distance 95% (HD95), mean surface distance (MSD) and residual mean square distance (RMSD).\\nThe contours generated by the proposed method closely resemble the ground-truth manual contours, as evidenced by encouraging quantitative results in terms of DSC, sensitivity, specificity, HD95, MSD and RMSD. For DSC, mean values of 0.91\\xa0±\\xa00.03, 0.89\\xa0±\\xa00.06, 0.86\\xa0±\\xa00.06, 0.95\\xa0±\\xa00.02, 0.95\\xa0±\\xa00.02, 0.96\\xa0±\\xa00.01, 0.87\\xa0±\\xa00.05 and 0.93\\xa0±\\xa00.03 were achieved for large bowel, small bowel, duodenum, left kidney, right kidney, liver, spinal cord and stomach, respectively.\\nThe proposed method could significantly expedite the treatment planning process by rapidly segmenting multiple OARs. The method could potentially be used in pancreatic adaptive radiotherapy to increase dose delivery accuracy and minimize gastrointestinal toxicity. Bowel wall thickening (BWT) on computed tomography (CT) has been frequently reported by radiologists. There are no clear guidelines regarding the level of thickening that is correlated with definite pathology. Radiologists usually rely on their overall subjective impression, and studies on inter-observer agreement (IOA) are lacking. This study evaluated IOA concerning BWT found on abdominal CT and identified the corresponding findings on endoscopy.\\nReports of abdominal CTs performed between January 2000 and December 2015 containing the term \\'thickening\\' were retrieved from the radiology department database. Corresponding patients who later underwent endoscopy were included. IOA concerning BWT was evaluated using a randomly mixed sample of 80 patients with normal findings or pathological BWT on endoscopy. A search for predictive factors for the subsequent finding of malignancy on endoscopy was performed using multivariate analysis.\\nDuring the study period, 6142 CT scans described thickening, equivalent to a BWT prevalence of 13.7%. Ninety-one patients (mean age, 58\\xa0years) were included in the analysis. Thickening was found most commonly in the stomach (38.5%), followed by the rectum (22%) and small intestine (14%). Twenty-seven patients (29.7%) exhibited diffuse BWT, whereas 64 patients showed localised BWT (70.3%). Biopsy was performed for 64 of 91 patients with endoscopies. Among these patients, 8.8% exhibited normal findings, whereas inflammation and malignancy were discovered in 25 and 51.6% of patients, respectively, with a positive predictive value for malignancy of 0.36. The IOA concerning CT for predicting significantly pathological BWT was moderate (mean κ\\xa0=\\xa00.6). A strong association was evident between the presence of lymph nodes on CT and the presence of neoplastic lesions.\\nOur study strongly recommends endoscopic follow-up of patients exhibiting BWT irrespective of the thickening location, especially if it is associated with lymphadenopathy. IOA between radiologists was moderate. Margetuximab, a novel, investigational, Fc-engineered, anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, is designed to more effectively potentiate innate immunity than trastuzumab. We aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antitumour activity of margetuximab plus pembrolizumab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) in previously treated patients with HER2-positive gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma.\\nCP-MGAH22-05 was a single-arm, open-label, phase 1b-2 dose-escalation and cohort expansion study done at 11 academic centres in the USA and Canada and 15 centres in southeast Asia (Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) that enrolled men and women aged 18 years or older with histologically proven, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, HER2-positive, PD-L1-unselected gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, who had progressed after at least one previous line of therapy with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in the locally advanced unresectable or metastatic setting. In the dose-escalation phase, nine patients were treated: three received margetuximab 10 mg/kg intravenously plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks and six received the recommended phase 2 dose of margetuximab 15 mg/kg plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. An additional 86 patients were enrolled in the phase 2 cohort expansion and received the recommended phase 2 dose. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, assessed in the safety population (patients who received at least one dose of either margetuximab or pembrolizumab) and the objective response rate as assessed by the investigator according to both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, in the response-evaluable population (patients with measurable disease at baseline and who received the recommended phase 2 dose of margetuximab and pembrolizumab). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02689284. Recruitment for the trial has completed and follow-up is ongoing.\\nBetween Feb 11, 2016, and Oct 2, 2018, 95 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 19·9 months (IQR 10·7-23·1). The combination therapy showed acceptable safety and tolerability; there were no dose-limiting toxicities in the dose-escalation phase. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [4%]) and infusion-related reactions (three [3%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in nine (9%) patients. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Objective responses were observed in 17 (18·48%; 95% CI 11·15-27·93) of 92 evaluable patients.\\nThese findings serve as proof of concept of synergistic antitumour activity with the combination of an Fc-optimised anti-HER2 agent (margetuximab) along with anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (pembrolizumab).\\nMacroGenics. To evaluate the technical feasibility of fluoroscopy-guided gastrojejunostomy creation in a porcine model.\\nEight domestic female pigs (median, 15.6\\xa0kg; range, 14.5-16.3\\xa0kg) were included in this study. The proximal jejunum was punctured from the stomach using a Rösch-Uchida Transjugular Liver Access Set through the mouth, and a lumen-apposing metal stent was placed across the puncture tract between the stomach and the proximal jejunum. All animals were euthanized 6\\xa0weeks after the procedure.\\nThe fistulous tract creation and stent insertion with confirmed patency were successful in eight animals, rendering a technical success rate of 100%. Gross inspection showed a matured and patent fistulous tract between the stomach and the proximal jejunum in seven animals. In one animal, the colon between the stomach and the proximal jejunum was inadvertently punctured followed by migration of the stent from the stomach into the colon after the procedure to form a delayed jejunocolostomy. A stent migration and an inadvertent traversing the tail of pancreas by the stent were observed in another two animals without signs of bleeding, infection, or pancreatitis. All animals survived until the end of this study without change in their behavior or appetite. Histological analysis showed that all the fistulous tracts had matured with continuity of submucosal, muscular, and serosal layers, and without destruction of epithelial layers.\\nFluoroscopy-guided gastrojejunostomy creation is technically feasible in a porcine model but requires refinement of the targeting technique to avoid transgression of nontarget organs. Targeting bioactives selectively to diseased sites is one of the most challenging aspects of cancer therapy. Herein, fabrication of colonic enzyme-responsive dextran based oligoester crosslinked nanoparticles is reported for the controlled release of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) - an anticancer drug. The 5-FU drug loaded nanoparticles (DNPs, size ~237\\xa0±\\xa025\\xa0nm, ζ-potential -17.0\\xa0±\\xa03\\xa0mV) were developed by the in-situ crosslinking of dextran with a bifunctional telechelic oligoester followed by the physical drug encapsulation via nanoprecipitation. Drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading capacity of DNPs were found to be ~76% (±0.1) and ~8% (±0.1), respectively. The DNPs were demonstrated to release the encapsulated drug selectively in the presence of dextranase enzyme. The in vitro release kinetics assay revealed that the DNPs released about 75% (±4) of the entrapped drug within 12\\xa0h of incubation with dextranase enzyme. No drug was released in a control experiment where DNPs were exposed to pH conditions encountered in the stomach and small intestine. Moreover, the treatment of HCT116 colon cancer cell line with the developed DNPs highlighted its biocompatibility as well as dextranase triggered cytotoxicity. The developed system offers an avenue to reduce the non-specific cytotoxicity of the encapsulated 5-FU, and a colon specific delivery of the encapsulated drug in response to the dextranase enzyme. Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. In China, its morbidity and mortality are second only to lung cancer. Chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy brings survival benefits to patients with advanced gastric cancer. Targets for targeted therapy of gastric cancer include human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Claudin 18.2 (CLDN 18.2). The main challenge of tumor molecule-targeted drugs is resistance. The main mechanisms of drug resistance include tumor establishment of compensatory signaling pathways, target protein changes, tumor microenvironment changes, tumor heterogeneity and tumor adaptation to targeted drugs. The combined action of multiple drug resistance mechanisms promotes the development of targeted drug resistance. In order to attract the attention of researchers, this paper reviews the mechanisms of drug resistance in gastric cancer-targeted therapy. In addition, the research status of drug resistance in molecule-targeted therapy of gastric cancer is summarized. It is of great clinical significance to explore the drug resistance mechanisms of targeted drugs and reverse drug resistance in gastric cancer. Last, the future development of molecule-targeted therapy is prospected. None Although endoscopic resection is safe and effective for gastric epithelial neoplasms, information is limited on its efficacy and safety in extremely elderly patients who have various comorbidities. Further, the relationship between comorbidities and complications of endoscopic resection is not well established. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection of gastric epithelial neoplasms in extremely elderly patients.\\nFrom October 2008 to December 2017, 4475 consecutive patients underwent endoscopic resection of gastric epithelial neoplasms. Among them, 242 were 75\\u2009years or older. We assessed Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) scores, procedural outcomes, and procedure- and sedation-related complications related to endoscopic resection.\\nMean patient age was 78.7\\u2009±\\u20093.2\\u2009years. Of the 242 patients, 124 (51.2%) had low-grade dysplasia and 112 (46.3%) had adenocarcinoma. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (55.4%), followed by diabetes (23.1%). The mean CCI score was 1.67\\u2009±\\u20091.43. Sixty patients (24.8%) had a CCI score\\u2009≥\\u20093. During the procedure, 10 (4.1%) patients had desaturation that recovered by flumazenil use with mask (n\\u2009=\\u20092) or Ambu bag (n\\u2009=\\u20093) ventilation. During subsequent admission, atelectasis or pneumonia occurred in 45 (18.6%) patients, post-procedural bleeding in 12 (5.0%), and perforation in 3 (1.2%). Respiratory complications were more common in patients with a CCI score\\u2009≥\\u20093 (20/60, 33.3%) than in those with a CCI score\\u2009<\\u20093 (25/182, 13.7%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002).\\nCCI score is related to respiratory complications of endoscopic resection in extremely elderly patients. Endoscopic resection must be performed cautiously, particularly in elderly patients with a high CCI score, to prevent respiratory complications. The increasing global cancer incidence corresponds to serious health impact in countries worldwide. Knowledge-powered health system in different languages would enhance clinicians\\' healthcare practice, patients\\' health management and public health literacy. High-quality corpus containing cancer information is the necessary foundation of cancer education. Massive non-structural information resources exist in clinical narratives, electronic health records (EHR) etc. They can only be used for training AI models after being transformed into structured corpus. However, the scarcity of multilingual cancer corpus limits the intelligent processing, such as machine translation in medical scenarios. Thus, we created the cancer specific cross-lingual corpus and open it to the public for academic use.\\nAiming to build an English-Chinese cancer parallel corpus, we developed a workflow of seven steps including data retrieval, data parsing, data processing, corpus implementation, assessment verification, corpus release, and application. We applied the workflow to a cross-lingual, comprehensive and authoritative cancer information resource, PDQ (Physician Data Query). We constructed, validated and released the parallel corpus named as ECCParaCorp, made it openly accessible online.\\nThe proposed English-Chinese Cancer Parallel Corpus (ECCParaCorp) consists of 6685 aligned text pairs in Xml, Excel, Csv format, containing 5190 sentence pairs, 1083 phrase pairs and 412 word pairs, which involved information of 6 cancers including breast cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer, and 3 cancer themes containing cancer prevention, screening, and treatment. All data in the parallel corpus are online, available for users to browse and download ( http://www.phoc.org.cn/ECCParaCorp/ ).\\nECCParaCorp is a parallel corpus focused on cancer in a cross-lingual form, which is openly accessible. It would make up the imbalance of scarce multilingual corpus resources, bridge the gap between human readable information and machine understanding data resources, and would contribute to intelligent technology application as a preparatory data foundation e.g. cancer-related machine translation, cancer system development towards medical education, and disease-oriented knowledge extraction. Increasing evidence suggests that aberrant long noncoding (lnc) RNA expression plays a vital role in gastric cancer (GC) initiation and progression. Thus, we aimed to develop a lncRNA-based risk signature and nomogram to predict overall survival (OS) for patients with GC. Our primary cohort was composed of 341 patients with clinical and lncRNA expression data in The Cancer Genome Atlas stomach adenocarcinoma (TCGA STAD), the internal validation cohort was composed of 172 randomly assigned patients, and the external validation cohort was composed of 300 patients from GSE62254 dataset. A risk signature and nomogram were developed for the primary cohort and validated on the validation cohorts. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the pathway enrichment for the risk signature. The expression patterns of several lncRNAs were also investigated in clinical samples from 10 GC patients. We identified and validated a 14-lncRNA signature highly associated with the OS of patients with GC, which performed well on evaluation with C-index, area under the curve, and calibration curves. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the lncRNA signature was an independent predictive factor for GC patients. Therefore, a nomogram incorporating lncRNA signature and clinical factors was constructed to predict OS for patients with GC in primary cohort that suggested powerful predictive values for survival in the TCGA cohort and the other two validation cohorts. In addition, GSEA indicated that the identified lncRNAs may regulate the autophagy pathway, affecting tumorigenesis and prognosis of patients with GC. Experimental validation demonstrated that the expression of lncRNAs showed the same trend both in our clinical samples and STAD dataset. These results suggest that both risk signature and nomogram were effective prognostic indicators for patients with GC. We hypothesized that deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) and computed-tomography image-guided radiotherapy (CT-IGRT) may be beneficial to decrease dose to organs at risk (OARs), when treating the stomach with radiotherapy for lymphoma. We compared dosimetric parameters of OARs from plans generated using free-breathing (FB) versus DIBH for 10 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the stomach treated with involved site radiotherapy. All patients had 4DCT and DIBH scans. Planning was performed with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to 30.6\\xa0Gy in 17 fractions. Differences in target volume and dosimetric parameters were assessed using a paired two-sided  A 55-year-old man with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy along with lymph node dissection and reconstruction with gastric conduit through the sternal route. He developed a continuous cough with sputum production, 3 years postoperatively. Chest radiography revealed a right middle lung field infiltrate. Chest computed tomography revealed communication between the reconstructed esophagus and the gastric conduit( pull-up) and right middle lobe airways. Upper gastrointestinal examination revealed ulcerative lesions involving the gastric mucosa;however, biopsy of the ulcer showed no malignancy. Conservative therapy including fasting and proton-pump inhibitor administration did not improve symptoms caused by gastropleural fistula. Thoracotomy was performed through the anterolateral intercostal space under the right-up supine position, and the partial lung resection and direct closure of the stomach with muscle flap wrapping was performed. A peptic ulcer is an alimentary tract injury that leads to a mucosal defect reaching the submucosa. This work aimed to optimize and maximize ellagic acid (EA) loading in Ca pectinate floating beads to maximize the release for 24 h. Three factors were selected: Ca pectinate concentration (X1, 1-3 w/v %), EA concentration (X2, 1-3 w/v %) and the dropping time (X3, 10-30 min). The factorial design proposed eight formulations. The optimized EA-Ca pectinate formulation was evaluated for the gastric ulcer index and the oxidative stress parameter determination of gastric mucosa. The results indicated that the optimum EA-Ca pectinate formula significantly improved the gastric ulcer index in comparison with raw EA. The protective effect of the optimized EA-Ca pectinate formula was further indicated by the histopathological features of the stomach. The results of the study indicate that an EA formulation in the form of Ca pectinate beads would be effective for protection against gastric ulcers because of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) administration. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of non-coding RNAs that have critical roles in regulation of expression of genes. They can inhibit or decrease expression of target genes mostly via interaction with 3\\' untranslated region of their targets. Their crucial roles in the regulation of expression of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have potentiated them as contributors in tumorigenesis. Moreover, their stability in body fluids has enhanced their potential as cancer biomarkers. In the present review article, we describe the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and advances in application of miRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in this kind of malignancy. None OBJECTIVE Thrombopoietin (THPO) is well-known as a megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF) involved in megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation. To explore the biological effects of THPO in gastric adenocarcinoma, we conducted this study. Methods: By accessing the TCGA database, the expression level of THPO was determined in tumor tissues. The association between THPO expression and clinical features, or prognostic significance was described by Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier. The SiRNA method was used to decline the THPO expression; then cell viability, invasion, and migration were detected to verify the effects of the knockdown of THPO. qPCR and western blotting were implemented to examine the expression level of THPO. Results: The expression of THPO was increased in tumor tissue and cells, its high-regulation was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Cell viability, invasion, and migration were suppressed in AGS with the down-regulation of THPO. Furthermore, on the basis of si-THPO transfection, E-cadherin was promoted while N-cadherin and Vimentin were attenuated. CONCLUSION Our results revealed that THPO may be a potent marker of gastric adenocarcinoma, providing a novel potential screening method for gastric adenocarcinoma. Concerns on health effects from uranium (U) mining still represent a major issue of debate. Any typology of active job in U mines is associated with exposure to U and its decay products, such as radon (Rn), thorium (Th), and radium (Ra) and its decay products with alpha-emission and gamma radiation. Health effects in U miners have been investigated in several cohort studies in the USA, Canada, Germany, the Czech Republic, and France. While public opinion is particularly addressed to pay attention to the safety of nuclear facilities, health hazard associated with mining is poorly debated. According to the many findings from cohort studies, the most significant positive dose-response relationship was found between occupational U exposure and lung cancer. Other types of tumors associated with occupational U exposure are leukemia and lymphoid cancers. Furthermore, it was found increased but not statistically significant death risk in U miners due to cancers in the liver, stomach, and kidneys. So far, there has not been found a significant association between U exposure and increased cardiovascular mortality in U miners. This review tries to address the current state of the art of these studies. Reprogramming of metabolism is described in many types of cancer and is associated with the clinical outcomes. However, the prognostic significance of pyrimidine metabolism signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is unclear. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, we found that the pyrimidine metabolism signaling pathway was significantly enriched in LUAD. Compared with normal lung tissues, the pyrimidine metabolic rate-limiting enzymes were highly expressed in lung tumor tissues. The high expression levels of pyrimidine metabolic-rate limiting enzymes were associated with unfavorable prognosis. However, purinergic receptors P2RX1, P2RX7, P2RY12, P2RY13, and P2RY14 were relatively downregulated in lung cancer tissues and were associated with favorable prognosis. Moreover, we found that hypo-DNA methylation, DNA amplification, and TP53 mutation were contributing to the high expression levels of pyrimidine metabolic rate-limiting enzymes in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, combined pyrimidine metabolic rate-limiting enzymes had significant prognostic effects in LUAD. Comprehensively, the pyrimidine metabolic rate-limiting enzymes were highly expressed in bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, and stomach cancer. And the high expression levels of pyrimidine metabolic rate-limiting enzymes were associated with unfavorable prognosis in liver cancer. Overall, our results suggested the mRNA levels of pyrimidine metabolic rate-limiting enzymes CAD, DTYMK, RRM1, RRM2, TK1, TYMS, UCK2, NR5C2, and TK2 were predictive of lung cancer as well as other cancers. Gastrectomy with omentectomy and D2 lymph node dissection is the current standard procedure for locally advanced gastric cancer. However, some retrospective studies have reported that omentectomy increased post-operative abdominal complications but provided no survival advantage over omentum preservation. Therefore, we plan a randomized controlled phase III trial to confirm the non-inferiority of omentum preservation compared with omentectomy in patients with cT3 (SS) or cT4a (SE) gastric cancer. A total of 1050 patients will be enrolled from 62 institutions over a period of 6.5\\xa0years. The primary end point is relapse-free survival, and the secondary end points are overall survival, blood loss, operation time and adverse events. This trial has been registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000036253. During \\nCagA promotes the expression of IL-6 in AGS cells by recruiting PKCδ through eEF1A1 in the cytoplasm to increase the phosphorylation of STAT3 Gene therapy by expression constructs or down-regulation of certain genes has shown great potential for the treatment of various diseases. The wide clinical application of nucleic acid materials dependents on the development of biocompatible gene carriers. There are enormous various compounds widely investigated to be used as non-viral gene carriers including lipids, polymers, carbon materials, and inorganic structures. In this review, we will discuss the recent discoveries on non-viral gene delivery systems. We will also highlight the in vivo gene delivery mediated by non-viral vectors to treat cancer in different tissue and organs including brain, breast, lung, liver, stomach, and prostate. Finally, we will delineate the state-of-the-art and promising perspective of in vivo gene editing using non-viral nano-vectors. Chemotherapy is an effective therapeutic modality which is commonly used for battling various cancers. However, several side effects induced by chemotherapeutic drugs would limit their clinical use. The present systematic review aims to evaluate the role of curcumin/curcuminoids co-administration during gastric cancer chemotherapy.\\nThis systematic review was done according to PRISMA guidelines and a full systematic search in the electronic databases up to May 2020 using search terms in the titles and abstracts for the identification of relevant literature. 279 articles were found in electronic databases and 175 articles screened by title and abstract. Finally, 13 articles were included in this systematic review according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria.\\nThe findings indicated that gastric cancer chemotherapy induces cytotoxicity effects in various ways including a decrease of cell viability, colony formation, metastasis, tumor growth, and weight, as well as elevation of apoptosis pathway, oxidative stress pathway compared to the control group. Co-administration of curcumin/curcuminoids with chemotherapy synergistically increased the effects of anti-cancer chemotherapy compared to the group solo treated with chemotherapeutic agents. Also, in chemoresistance gastric cancer cells, co-administration of curcumin reduced chemoresistance mainly through the reduction of NF-κB activation and elevation of apoptosis.\\nAccording to the findings, the use of curcumin/curcuminoids during gastric cancer chemotherapy has chemosensitizing effects, and also it can reduce chemoresistance in gastric cancer. None Laparoscopic surgery (LAP) and hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) for mobilization of the stomach and abdominal lymph node dissection in esophagectomy have become standard procedures in Japan. However, the differences in outcomes between LAP and HALS have not been examined. We aimed to compare the safety and feasibility of these techniques in patients undergoing esophagectomy.\\nWe assessed 171 patients who underwent esophagectomy and reconstruction for clinical stage 0 to IVa esophageal cancer; 108 patients were treated with HALS and 63 with LAP. Mortality, morbidity, and long-term survival were compared in all patients who had undergone these surgical procedures and then in 59 propensity score-matched pairs to correct for differences in baseline characteristics.\\nIn our analysis, HALS had a shorter abdominal operative time (84.4 ±\\u200926.6 vs 110.0 ±\\u200934.1 minutes, P <\\u2009.0001), but LAP enabled a larger number of abdominal lymph nodes to be harvested with (17.9 ±\\u20096.6 vs 15.4 ±\\u20097.4, P =\\u2009.0486). The 5-year overall survival rates were 62.1% and 74.5% (P =\\u2009.1257) for patients who had undergone HALS and LAP, respectively, and the relapse-free survival rates were 67.0% and 72.3% (P =\\u2009.7243).\\nThere were no significant differences in postoperative mortality and morbidity between the two groups. This suggests that in addition to having a short operative time, HALS has good technical feasibility and is oncologically safe for patients with esophageal cancer. None 3,3\\'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a naturally derived chemopreventive compound. It comes from glucobrassicin, an indole glucosinolate enriched in cruciferous vegetables, and is formed in the acidic environment of the stomach after ingestion. Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) is an important, multi-functional oncogenic protein and it has been well recognized for its negative regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. We discovered a novel mechanism of action of DIM, that it directly inhibits MDM2 in multiple colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. Treatment with DIM decreased MDM2 at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, inhibited cancer cell proliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. DIM-induced decrease of MDM2 is p53-independent and is partly mediated by proteasome degradation of MDM2, as blocking of the proteasome activity reversed MDM2 protein inhibition. Overexpression of MDM2 blocked DIM\\'s effects in growth suppression and apoptosis induction. When combined with imidazoline MDM2 inhibitors (Nutlin-3a and Idasanutlin/RG-7388), synergism was observed in cancer cell growth inhibition. In summary, our data support a new mechanism of action for DIM in direct inhibition of MDM2. The identification of MDM2 as a novel DIM target may help develop a new strategy in CRC prevention. The prognosis of gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis (GCPC) remains poor despite recent advances in systemic chemotherapy (SC) with an average survival less than 6 months. Current evidence supporting the utility of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) combined with SC for GCPC is limited. We plan to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the comparative effects and safety of HIPEC combined with SC in the management of GCPC.\\nRandomized controlled trials evaluating HIPEC combined with SC versus SC as first-line treatment for GCPC will be searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar, from database inception to April 30, 2020. Data on study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, and outcomes will be extracted. Primary outcomes to be assessed are: median progression-free survival; secondary outcomes are: median survival time, 1- year survival rate, 2-year survival rate, objective response rate, and adverse events. Meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan V.5.3 statistical software. Data will be combined with a random effect model. Study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Heterogeneity will be assessed, and if necessary, a subgroup analysis will be performed to explore the source of heterogeneity.\\nThe results will provide useful information about the effectiveness and safety of HIPEC combined with systemic chemotherapy regimens in patients with gastric cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis.\\nThe findings of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal.\\nINPLASY202050006.\\n10.37766/inplasy2020.5.0006. The incidence of small bowel tumors is comparatively rare when compared to colonic tumors. They comprise less than 10% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract; however it accounts for less than 1% of all gastrointestinal tumors.\\nTo report a rare case of jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting as a life-threatening emergency in a young adult male who was treated in the General Surgery department in the Jordanian Royal Medical Services (JRMS), Amman, Jordan.\\nWe report a 59-year-old male who presented to our emergency department with severe generalized abdominal pain. The patient was in a hypovolemic shock. Abdominal examination revealed a massively distended, tender abdomen. Abdomenal CT scan with IV contrast showed significant fat stranding around the jejunum associated with pneumoperitoneum and free fluid. Exploratory laparotomy was emergently performed, revealing diffuse peritonitis secondary to perforated small bowel tumor. En bloc resection was performed. Histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the jejunum with R0 clearance.\\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors are relatively rare and the jejunum is the least affected among other parts of the GI tract. The majority of ruptured GISTs occur spontaneously, and are located in the stomach and small bowel. Most ruptured GISTs are associated with dismal prognosis.\\nA jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumor can rarely present with spontaneous perforation. However, it is important to highlight this condition, as early emergency intervention constitutes the key to a good outcome. Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Individuals infected with Helicobacter pylori have a higher likelihood of developing gastric cancer than individuals who are not infected. Eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population may reduce the incidence of gastric cancer, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of eradication of H. pylori in healthy asymptomatic individuals in the general population in reducing the incidence of gastric cancer.\\nWe identified trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2020), and EMBASE (1974 to February 2020). We handsearched reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching to identify further relevant trials. We handsearched published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) between 2001 and 2019. We contacted members of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group and experts in the field and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.\\nWe analysed randomised controlled trials comparing at least one week of H. pylori therapy with placebo or no treatment in preventing subsequent development of gastric cancer in otherwise healthy and asymptomatic H. pylori-positive adults. Trials had to follow up participants for at least two years and needed to have at least two participants with gastric cancer as an outcome. We defined gastric cancer as any gastric adenocarcinoma, including intestinal (differentiated) or diffuse (undifferentiated) type, with or without specified histology.\\nWe collected data on incidence of gastric cancer, incidence of oesophageal cancer, deaths from gastric cancer, deaths from any cause, and adverse effects arising due to therapy.\\nSix trials met all our eligibility criteria and provided extractable data in the previous version. Following our updated search, one new RCT was identified, meaning that seven trials were included in this updated review. In addition, one previously included trial provided fully published data out to 10 years, and another previously included trial provided fully published data out to 22 years of follow-up. Four trials were at low risk of bias, one trial was at unclear risk, and two trials were at high risk of bias. Six trials were conducted in Asian populations. In preventing development of subsequent gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication therapy was superior to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.72, 7 trials, 8323 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Only two trials reported the effect of eradication of H. pylori on the development of subsequent oesophageal cancer. Sixteen (0.8%) of 1947 participants assigned to eradication therapy subsequently developed oesophageal cancer compared with 13 (0.7%) of 1941 participants allocated to placebo (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.54, moderate certainty evidence). H. pylori eradication reduced mortality from gastric cancer compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92, 4 trials, 6301 participants, moderate certainty evidence). There was little or no evidence in all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12, 5 trials, 7079 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Adverse events data were poorly reported.\\nWe found moderate certainty evidence that searching for and eradicating H. pylori reduces the incidence of gastric cancer and death from gastric cancer in healthy asymptomatic infected Asian individuals, but we cannot necessarily extrapolate this data to other populations. We propose a novel two-stage analysis strategy to discover candidate genes associated with the particular cancer outcomes in large multimodal genomic cancers databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). During the first stage, we use mixed mutual information to perform variable selection; during the second stage, we use scalable Bayesian network (BN) modeling to identify candidate genes and their interactions. Two crucial features of the proposed approach are (i) the ability to handle mixed data types (continuous and discrete, genomic, epigenomic, etc.) and (ii) a flexible boundary between the variable selection and network modeling stages - the boundary that can be adjusted in accordance with the investigators\\' BN software scalability and hardware implementation. These two aspects result in high generalizability of the proposed analytical framework. We apply the above strategy to three different TCGA datasets (LGG, Brain Lower Grade Glioma; HNSC, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma; STES, Stomach and Esophageal Carcinoma), linking multimodal molecular information (SNPs, mRNA expression, DNA methylation) to two clinical outcome variables (tumor status and patient survival). We identify 11 candidate genes, of which 6 have already been directly implicated in the cancer literature. One novel LGG prognostic factor suggested by our analysis, methylation of TMPRSS11F type II transmembrane serine protease, presents intriguing direction for the follow-up studies. The efficacy and bleeding complications of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) in routine clinical practice remain unclear. Moreover, data on long-term outcomes in patients with cancer-associated VTE who received DOAC therapy are limited.Methods\\u2004and\\u2004Results:This retrospective study enrolled 1,096 consecutive patients with acute VTE who received warfarin or DOAC therapy between April 2014 and May 2017. The mean follow-up period was 665±490 days. The number of cancer-associated VTE patients who received DOAC therapy was 334. Patients who could not be followed up and those prescribed off-label under-dose DOAC were excluded. Finally, 303 patients with cancer-associated VTE were evaluated. The number of cases of major bleeding and VTE recurrence was 54 (17.8%) and 26 (8.6%), respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the factors correlated with major bleeding were high cancer stage, high performance status, liver dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and stomach cancer; those correlated with recurrent VTE were initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, uterine cancer, and previous cerebral infarction. Major bleeding was an independent risk factor of all-cause death. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, those who received prolonged DOAC therapy had lower composite major bleeding and recurrent VTE risks than those who did not.\\nIn DOAC therapy for cancer-associated VTE, major bleeding prevention is important because it is an independent risk factor of death. None This study aimed to investigate risk factors for lymph node (LN) or distant metastasis after non-curative endoscopic resection (ER) of undifferentiated-type early gastric cancer (EGC).\\nOf 1124 patients who underwent ER for undifferentiated-type gastric cancer at 18 tertiary hospitals across six geographic areas in Korea between 2005 and 2014, 634 with non-curative ER beyond the expanded criteria were retrospectively enrolled. According to the treatment after ER, patients were divided into additional surgery (n\\u2009=\\u2009270) and follow-up (n\\u2009=\\u2009364) groups. The median follow-up duration was 59\\xa0months for recurrence and 84\\xa0months for mortality.\\nLN metastasis was found in 6.7% (18/270) of patients at surgery. Ulcer [odds ratio (OR) 3.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-12.13; p\\u2009=\\u20090.022] and submucosal invasion (OR 10.35; 95% CI 1.35-79.48; p\\u2009=\\u20090.025) were independent risk factors. In the follow-up group, seven patients (1.9%) developed LN or distant recurrence. Ulcer [hazard ratio (HR) 7.60; 95% CI 1.39-35.74; p\\u2009=\\u20090.018], LVI (HR 6.80; 95% CI 1.07-42.99; p\\u2009=\\u20090.042), and positive vertical margin (HR 6.71; 95% CI 1.28-35.19; p\\u2009=\\u20090.024) were independent risk factors. In the overall cohort, LN metastasis rates were 9.6% in patients with two or more risk factors and 1.2% in those with no or one risk factor.\\nLVI, ulcer, submucosal invasion, and positive vertical margin are independently associated with LN or distant metastasis after non-curative ER of undifferentiated-type EGC. Surgical resection is strongly recommended for patients with two or more risk factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathohistological status of mucous lining infected with Helicobacte pylori as the possible cause of chronic laryngitis and laryngeal carcinoma.\\nThe prospective examination included 51 patients suffering from planocellular laryngeal cancer and 26 examinees suffering from chronic laryngitis. The examinees and the control group were subjected to esophagogastroduodenoscopy which described the local status of the esophagus and stomach. Two biopsy samplings are taken from the stomach antrum and corpus. One part of the biopsies was colored using the histological technique used in the pathohistological detection of H. pylori, while the other part was incorporated in paraffin cubes where the H. Pylori gene expression was determined using the deparaffinization and PCR method DNA isolation.\\nIn the group of examinees suffering from laryngeal tumor, there were a higher number of patients suffering also from chronic gastritis (32/51) than in the other group, suffering from chronic laryngitis (9/26). In the chronic laryngitis group, there were more examinees with acute gastritis (12/26) than in the examined group (11/51). The difference is statistically significant (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0457).\\nChronic gastritis and H. pylori infection are risk factors for laryngeal carcinoma formation; therefore, acute gastritis with helicobacter pylori infection must be immediately treated to not let infection to become chronic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of postoperative infectious complications on long-term outcomes after curative resection of gastric cancer.\\nPatients who underwent curative gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer at Yokohama City University and Kanagawa Cancer Center from January 2000 to August 2015 were retrospectively selected from medical records. Clinicopathological factors between patients with and without infectious complications were compared. Prognostic factors of long-term survival were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.\\nA total of 2,254 patients were eligible for inclusion in the present study. Fifty-eight patients had postoperative infectious complications (IC group); 2,196 had no postoperative infectious complications (NC group). In the IC group, the median age (p=0.031), body mass index (p=0.004), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (p=0.006) and percentage of male patients (p<0.001) were higher in comparison to the NC group. The operation time was longer (p<0.001) and the incidence of intestinal-type histology was higher (p=0.017) in the IC group. The 5-year overall survival rates of the IC and NC groups were 59.8% and 83.2%, respectively (p<0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that postoperative infectious complications were a significant risk factor for poorer overall survival (hazard ratio=2.38; 95% confidence interval=1.47-3.85, p<0.001).\\nPerioperative management is necessary to reduce the incidence of postoperative infectious complications and improve the survival of patients after curative resection of gastric cancer. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a markedly higher overall mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as many other causes of death like cancer. Since diabetes is a multisystem disease, this fact together with the increased lifespan among individuals with diabetes may also lead to the emergence of other diabetes-related complications and ultimately to diversification of the causes of death.\\nThe study population of this observational historic cohort study consisted of subjects with DM, who had purchased for at least one insulin prescription and/or one oral antidiabetic between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2010 (N=199\\xa0354), and a reference population matched by age, sex and hospital district (N=199\\xa0354). Follow-up was continued until December 31, 2017. All-cause and cause-specific mortality (cancer, CHD and stroke) was analysed with Poisson and Cox\\'s regression. Associations between baseline medications and mortality were analysed using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) models.\\nThe mortality rates were significantly elevated among the patients with DM. However, the relative risk of all-cause mortality between the DM and reference populations tended to converge during the follow-up. The lowering trend was most apparent in CHD mortality. The difference between DM and reference populations in stroke mortality vanished with a later entrance to the follow-up period. There were a few differences between DM and no-DM groups with respect to how baseline medications were associated with mortality.\\nThe gap between the mortality of patients with diabetes compared to subjects who are non-diabetic diminished markedly during the 21-year period. This was driven primarily by the reduced CHD mortality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term survival outcomes of KDOG1001 trial after a minimum follow-up of 3\\xa0years.\\nPatients with bulky N2 lymph nodes, linitis plastica (type 4), or large ulcero-invasive-type tumors (type 3) received up to four 28-day cycles of DCS neoadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel at 40\\xa0mg/m\\nFrom May 2010 through January 2017, 40 patients were enrolled. All included patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with DCS followed by gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, and 32 (80%) completed adjuvant S-1 therapy for 1\\xa0year. After a median follow-up for surviving patients of 68\\xa0months at the last follow-up in January 2020, 3-year overall survival rate was 77.5% (95% confidence interval 62.1-87.9%), while 3-year relapse-free survival rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval 46.8-76.0%).\\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of DCS followed by D2 gastrectomy plus adjuvant S-1 was associated with relatively good long-term oncologic outcomes for patients with the high-risk gastric cancer. To validate the prognostic impacts of the left gastric artery lymph node (No. 7 LN) metastasis and investigate whether the No. 7 LN metastasis should be considered as the predictive LN for extra-gastric LN metastases.\\nBetween January 2003 and December 2011, a total of 1,586 patients who underwent R0 gastrectomy were retrospected. Patients with LN metastases were divided into three groups: (I) patients with only peri-gastric LN metastases (peri-gastric group); (II) patients with peri-gastric and only No. 7 LN metastases (No. 7 group); and (III) patients with other extra-gastric LN metastases (extra-gastric group). Propensity score matching (PSM) was adopted to accurately evaluate prognoses of all patients after surgery.\\nOf 1,586 patients, 235 (14.82%) were pathologically identified to present with the No. 7 LN metastases. Patients with the No. 7 LN metastases presented the significantly lower survival rate both before and after adjustment by pTNM stage, compared to those without the No. 7 LN metastases. Patients in the No. 7 group were identified to present the significant lower survival rate than those in the peri-gastric group, and to present the similar median overall survival (OS) to those in the extra-gastric group. In addition, patients with extra-gastric LN except No. 7 LN metastases failed to show any superiority of survival outcomes, compared with those with extra-gastric LN metastases including the No. 7 LN metastasis.\\nThe No. 7 LN metastases had the crucial survival implications. Nevertheless, the No. 7 LN failed to be considered as the predictive LN for the extra-gastric LN metastases in gastric cancer (GC). An 81-year-old woman had undergone laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer. A permanent colostomy was created through an intraperitoneal route. Three months after the surgery, the patient presented with lower abdominal pain and vomiting. Computed tomography showed gastric incarceration through the lateral space of the lifted sigmoid colostomy. Although the herniated stomach was reduced by nasogastric tube decompression, the patient experienced a recurrence of gastric hernia shortly thereafter. A laparoscopic operation was performed, and a new colostomy was constructed through an extraperitoneal route. The patient had no hernia recurrence during the 20\\xa0months of follow-up after the operation. Gastric internal hernia associated with colostomy can occur as a rare complication. Although reduction of the incarcerated stomach is possible by nasogastric tube decompression, surgical repair of the hernia may be the optimal management to prevent recurrence.  Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare epithelial tumors with heterogeneous and frequently unpredictable clinical behavior. Available biomarkers are insufficient to guide individual patient prognosis or therapy selection. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is an enzyme expressed by neuroendocrine cells that participates in hormone maturation. The objective of this study was to assess the distribution, clinical associations and survival implications of PAM immunoreactivity in primary NENs. Of 109 primary NENs, 7% were PAM-negative, 25% were PAM-low and 68% were PAM-high. Staining intensity was high in small bowel (p\\u2009=\\u20090.04) and low in stomach (p\\u2009=\\u20090.004) NENs. PAM staining was lower in higher grade tumors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and patients who died (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) but did not vary by tumor size or stage at surgery. In patients who died, time to death was shorter in patients with reduced PAM immunoreactivity: median times to death were 11.3 (PAM-negative), 29.4 (PAM-low) and 61.7 (PAM-high) months. Lower PAM staining was associated with increased risk of death after adjusting for disease stage [PAM negative, HR\\u2009=\\u200913.8 (CI: 4.2-45.5)]. PAM immunoreactivity in primary NENs is readily assessable and a potentially useful stage-independent predictor of survival.  There are many pieces of evidence support the effect of cancer stem cells on the initiation and progression of cancer. However, related mechanisms involved in these phenomena are far more complicated to understand. The function of different stemness factorsin cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their complex associations at different levels of cancer have been reported. Therefore, it seems that focusing on one master factor would be more helpful to complete the puzzle of singling pathways in these cells. Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) also known as POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1(POU5F1), one of these key pluripotency factors, has important roles in both embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. In this review, we gathered information about the association of different markers with OCT4 expression in three types of gastrointestinal cancers including esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancers. OCT4 through different signaling pathways has an impact on different processes of gastrointestinal cancers such as proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Based on the literature, OCT4 has great effects on cancer progression at different stages, therefore we suggested it has potential implications in therapeutic options.  The antitumor activity and toxicity of doxorubicin are potentiated and attenuated by calcitriol, respectively. Potentially, calcitriol can be combined with doxorubicin for clinical benefit in chemotherapy. To gain insight into the interaction between doxorubicin and calcitriol, proposed for combined use in cancer treatment, we studied calcitriol\\'s effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion of doxorubicin in female and male mice.\\nThe control and calcitriol-treated groups, including an equal number of both sexes, received corn oil and calcitriol (2.5\\xa0μg/kg), respectively, intraperitoneally every other day for 8\\xa0days. At day\\xa09, doxorubicin was administered intraperitoneally at a 6\\xa0mg/kg dose to each group. Doxorubicin concentrations in biologic specimens were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatographic-ultraviolet detector and analyzed using a non-compartmental model.\\nThe plasma pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin were similar in the control and calcitriol-treated groups. While calcitriol did not alter the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C\\nThe tissue concentrations and excretion of doxorubicin in both female and male mice are influenced by calcitriol without changes in the plasma pharmacokinetics. The results from this study can provide insights to help obtain the optimal drug combination effects of doxorubicin with calcitriol in cancer treatment. This study aims to systematically review the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in gastric cancer and to discuss the potential limitations and future directions of AI in gastric cancer.\\nA systematic review was performed that follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Pubmed, EMBASE, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were used to search for gastric cancer publications with an emphasis on AI that were published up to June 2020. The terms \"artificial intelligence\" and \"gastric cancer\" were used to search for the publications.\\nA total of 64 articles were included in this review. In gastric cancer, AI is mainly used for molecular bio-information analysis, endoscopic detection for Helicobacter pylori infection, chronic atrophic gastritis, early gastric cancer, invasion depth, and pathology recognition. AI may also be used to establish predictive models for evaluating lymph node metastasis, response to drug treatments, and prognosis. In addition, AI can be used for surgical training, skill assessment, and surgery guidance.\\nIn the foreseeable future, AI applications can play an important role in gastric cancer management in the era of precision medicine. Primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PG-DLBCL) is a common subtype of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) as the commonly used treatment regimen. However, full cycles of standard R-CHOP present the risk of severe bleeding or perforation, even leading to emergency surgery, especially for those with deep lesions in their first 1-2 cycles of treatment. This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of fractioned R-CHOP (rituximab d0, 50% dose of CHOP d1 and d5) followed by standard R-CHOP cycles in PG-DLBCL patients guided by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).\\nThirty-one PG-DLBCL patients were analyzed in this retrospective study. All patients had lesions infiltrated to at least the 3rd layer of the stomach under EUS at baseline. Patients switched to standard R-CHOP if they showed the reduced infiltrated layers and restricted lesions after fractioned R-CHOP cycles.\\nThe overall response rate, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients in our study were 93.5%, 75% and 84%, respectively. No treatment delay or dosage reduction from gastric adverse event was observed. None of the patients in our study suffered from severe bleeding or perforation during the treatment. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that PG-DLBCL patients characterized by multiple localization, lesions ≥3cm, having B symptoms, lower serum albumin level, and elevated LDH level were associated with worse PFS and OS.\\nOur data indicate that it might be an effective approach in treating deeply infiltrated PG-DLBCL patients by switching fractioned R-CHOP to standard R-CHOP cycles guided by EUS. We investigated the correlation of cancer research in China with its disease burden and national or provincial wealth. We also compared China\\'s research output with that of other Asian countries.\\nChinese publications on cancer research for 2009-18 were retrieved from the Web of Science with a special filter giving high precision and recall. Their volume relative to gross domestic product (GDP) was compared with those of 14 Asian countries, and provincial outputs with provincial GDPs. Their distribution by anatomical site was compared with China\\'s disease burden, and by research type with that of Europe.\\nChinese cancer research publications (including those from Taiwan) have grown rapidly in the last 10 years, and overtook those of the USA in 2018. Relative to other Asian countries, Chinese output was approximately proportionate to its wealth. Relative to its cancer burden (as a percentage of the total disease burden), China published an appropriate amount of cancer research in 2009-13, but almost one-third more in 2014-18. Its distribution between the provinces reflected their wealth, but with comparatively greater outputs from Beijing and Shanghai. The distribution of China\\'s cancer research portfolio by anatomical site corresponded to its disease burden quite well, with a heavy emphasis on liver and stomach cancer. However, China did relatively less research on screening, diagnosis, palliative care, or quality of life.\\nThe national and provincial cancer research in China in the past 10 years correlated relatively well with its disease burden and economic level, but over-emphasised basic research compared with prevention, screening and end-of-life care. Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is an acute, progressive, and fatal disease. PTTM manifests as subacute respiratory failure with pulmonary hypertension, progressive right-sided heart failure, and sudden death. An antemortem diagnosis of PTTM is very difficult to obtain, and many patients die within several weeks. We herein report a case of PTTM diagnosed based on a transbronchial lung biopsy. In this case, we finally diagnosed PTTM due to gastric cancer because of its histological identity. The patient was administered chemotherapy, including angiogenesis inhibitors, against gastric cancer at an early age and survived for a long time. We examined the risk of primary gastrointestinal cancers in women with breast cancer and compared this risk with that of the general population.\\nUsing population-based Danish registries, we conducted a cohort study of women with incident non-metastatic breast cancer (1990-2017). We computed cumulative cancer incidences and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs).\\nAmong 84\\u2009972 patients with breast cancer, we observed 2340 gastrointestinal cancers. After 20 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of gastrointestinal cancers was 4%, driven mainly by colon cancers. Only risk of stomach cancer was continually increased beyond 1\\u2009year following breast cancer. The SIR for colon cancer was neutral during 2-5 years of follow-up and approximately 1.2-fold increased thereafter. For cancer of the oesophagus, the SIR was increased only during 6-10 years. There was a weak association with pancreas cancer beyond 10 years. Between 1990-2006 and 2007-2017, the 1-10 years SIR estimate decreased and reached unity for upper gastrointestinal cancers (oesophagus, stomach, and small intestine). For lower gastrointestinal cancers (colon, rectum, and anal canal), the SIR estimate was increased only after 2007. No temporal effects were observed for the remaining gastrointestinal cancers. Treatment effects were negligible.\\nBreast cancer survivors were at increased risk of oesophagus and stomach cancer, but only before 2007. The risk of colon cancer was increased, but only after 2007. Although an anastomotic leak after esophagectomy is one of the most common postoperative complications, it is not well understood whether specific anatomic factors of the different route of reconstruction can predispose to the development of anastomotic leak after esophagectomy. This study aimed to clarify whether various factors related to the size of the thoracic inlet are independent predictors of anastomotic leak after esophagectomy.\\nWe reviewed 248 patients who underwent esophagectomy with retrosternal reconstruction of the gastric conduit between January 2013 and March 2019. Various factors related to the size of the thoracic inlet were measured using computed tomography. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between various measurements and anastomotic leak.\\nAnastomotic leak occurred in 38 patients (15.3%). On univariate analysis, the thickness of the sternum, the thickness of the clavicle, the sternum-trachea distance, the ratio of the sternum-trachea distance/sternum-vertebral body distance, sex, body mass index, and method of anastomosis were statistically significantly associated with anastomotic leak. On multivariate analysis, the ratio of the sternum-trachea distance/sternum-vertebral body distance and the method of anastomosis were the independent risk factors for anastomotic leak.\\nThe ratio of the sternum-trachea distance/sternum-vertebral body distance is associated with cervical anastomotic leak after retrosternal gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy. Measurement of the thoracic inlet space may contribute to preoperative planning, such as for the route of the conduit for reconstruction and anastomotic site. Lynch syndrome (LS), which is known as a hereditary cancer syndrome, is distinguished by microsatellite instability, represented by the altered number of repetitive sequences in the coding and/or non-coding region. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (e.g., MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) has been recognized as an useful technique for screening of LS. Previous study has shown that the assessment of IHC, however, requires specific caution due to variable staining patterns even without germline mutations in MMR genes.\\nA 48-year-old man, who had been treated for anaplastic astrocytoma, was referred to our department for the precise examination of progressing anemia. Whole-body examination revealed two advanced carcinomas in descending colon and stomach. A hypo-vascular mass lesion was detected in liver as well. Pathological diagnosis (on surgical specimens) was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in descending colon, moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in stomach, and liver metastasis, which is possibly from colon. It was suspected that this case would be Turcot\\'s syndrome-type-1 due to its specific family history having two cases of colon cancer within the second relatives. Pathogenic frameshift mutations in codon 618 of MLH1 gene was identified. Immunohistochemical analyses (IHC) demonstrated complete loss of MLH1 immuno-expression as well as of PMS2 except for those in brain tumor. Although frameshift mutation was not found in MSH6 gene, histological expression of MSH6 was patchy in primary colon carcinoma and was completely lost in the metastatic site in liver. MSH6 expression in gastric carcinoma, a coincidental cancer in this case, was intact. An abnormal (C)8 region was identified by the cloned PCR of colon and liver tumors but not from gastric cancer. Frameshift mutation in a (C)8 tract in exon 5 of the MSH6 gene was also detected in liver metastasis.\\nThis case supports a plausible mechanism, proposed by a previous literature, for the reduced expression of MSH6 in a somatic mutation manner, which might preferentially happen in colon cancer rather than in stomach carcinoma in MLH1/PMS2-deficient type of Turcot\\'s syndrome type 1. Although the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer (GC) decreased in the last years, some countries remain highly affected. Especially in high-income economies the cases of cardia types are steadily increasing. Currently, GC is ranked third as cause for cancer death worldwide, whereby two-thirds of deaths still occur in lowincome countries. But the global numbers are changing, and new regional challenges must be addressed.\\nTherefore, this disease has been chosen for in-depth bibliometric analyses that combines the evaluation of publication meta-data with density equalizing visualization techniques. This study focuses on the chronological and geographical characteristics of GC research worldwide. Epidemiological and socio-economic parameters were analyzed and the influence of political framework conditions was examined. In addition, international collaborations and research priorities were evaluated.\\nIn the last years, the publication numbers are rising more extensively in comparison to other cancer types. Albeit the usual leading positions, the United States is not the most publishing country on GC. It occupies the third position. Instead, China and Japan are the most publishing countries and together with South Korea also the key players as well as the most affected countries. These countries\\' governments are also the main donors for GC-research. The number of articles and the expenditures for research and development (R&D) as well as the incidence rate are correlated. Despite the scarce contribution of low-economic countries to the publication output, international collaborations lead to a modest output in those regions.\\nThis study pools background information for scientists, practitioners, funders and decision-makers by providing information on the development and priorities of GC research. Adaptive international approaches and partnerships are crucial to meet future changing epidemiological features worldwide. 胃母细胞瘤是发生于胃部的一种罕见、具有独特特征的双向分化肿瘤。该文报道1例发生于胃窦胃体交界处的胃母细胞瘤。患者女，53岁。因上腹部隐痛不适1年，发现胃窦胃体交界处隆起性病变伴溃疡形成，临床拟诊\"胃肠道间质瘤\"行\"胃肠道间质瘤切除术\"。大体见附部分胃黏膜灰白灰红色结节样肿物一个，体积5.0 cm×4.2 cm×4.0 cm，切面灰白，半透亮，局部囊性变。镜下观察瘤细胞密度不均，细胞密集区肿瘤细胞呈上皮样形态，排列呈小巢状或条索状，可见腺管形成的趋势，细胞核轻度异型。稀疏区肿瘤细胞核呈卵圆形或短梭形，肿瘤细胞弥漫片状分布于黏液样基质中，部分区黏液聚集呈肺水肿样结构，部分区呈微囊样。免疫标记广谱细胞角蛋白、上皮细胞膜抗原上皮样区域阳性，CD10、波形蛋白梭形细胞区阳性，Ki-67阳性指数小于1%。诊断为胃母细胞瘤。.  Esophageal cancer remains an oncological burden with a low survival rate. Multidisciplinary management is essential to offer an adjusted treatment to the patient general condition and the tumor stage. New minimally invasive surgical treatments help to reduce the surgical trauma and improve post-operative patient recovery. Oncological treatments have also evolved and definitive treatment by radio-chemotherapy can be proposed in specific cases.\\nLe cancer de l’œsophage reste un fardeau oncologique avec un taux de survie bas. Une prise en charge multidisciplinaire est primordiale afin d’offrir un traitement adapté à l’état général du patient et au stade de la tumeur. De nouvelles prises en charge minimalement invasives chirurgicales permettent de diminuer le traumatisme d’une chirurgie majeure et améliorent la récupération des patients en postopératoire. Les traitements oncologiques ont également évolué et un traitement définitif par radiochimiothérapie peut être proposé dans des cas précis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to play important roles in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, detailed knowledge about lncRNAs in GC is limited. Therefore we carried out an in-depth study of public data and found 83 differently expressed lncRNAs in GC. To further confirm the target genes of these lncRNAs, we constructed a co-expression network between lncRNAs and mRNAs and found three lncRNAs (MBNL1-AS1, HAND2-AS1 and MIR100HG) were at the core of the network. By coalition analysis of clinical information and the three lncRNAs\\' expression level from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE15459 data sets, we found MIR100HG could be a potential prognostic factor. Clinical samples showed patients with higher MIR100HG expression had poorer prognosis, and further experiments demonstrated that MIR100HG was associated with proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells. Hopefully, MIR100HG might be considered as a novel prognostic factor and biomarker for GC. Indocyanine green (ICG) has been recently introduced in clinical practice as a fluorescent tracer. Lymphadenectomy is particularly challenging in gastric cancer surgery, owing to the complex anatomical drainage.\\nThe primary outcomes of this study were the feasibility and usefulness of ICG-guided lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer surgery, considering both the success rate and improved understanding of the surgical anatomy of nodal basins. The secondary outcome was the diagnostic ability of ICG to predict the presence of nodal metastases.\\nWe conducted a single-center prospective trial comprising 13 patients with gastric cancer. ICG was injected the afternoon prior to surgery or intraoperatively via the submucosal or subserosal route. Standard lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients, according to patient age and tumor stage, as usual, but after standard lymphadenectomy the residual ICG\\u2009+\\u2009nodes were harvested and analyzed. Each nodal station and each dissected node was recorded and classified as ICG\\u2009+\\u2009or ICG- (both in vivo and back table evaluation was utilized for classification). After pathological analysis, each nodal station and each dissected node was recorded as metastatic or nonmetastatic (E&E staining).\\nThe feasibility rate was 84.6% (11/13). The mean number of dissected lymph nodes per patient was 37.9. Focusing on the 11 patients in whom ICG-guided nodal navigation was successfully performed, 81 lymph node stations were removed, for a total of 417 lymph nodes. Sixty-six stations (81.48%), comprising a total of 336 lymph nodes, exhibited fluorescence. No IC- node was metastatic; all 54 metastatic nodes were ICG\\u2009+\\u2009. A total of 282 ICG\\u2009+\\u2009nodes were nonmetastatic. In two cases, some nodes outside D2 areas were harvested, being ICG\\u2009+\\u2009(1 case of metastatic node).\\nFluorescence lymphography-guided lymphadenectomy is a promising new technique that combines a high feasibility rate with considerable ease of use. Regarding its diagnostic value, the key finding from this prospective series is that no metastatic nodes were found outside fluorescent lymph node stations. Further studies are needed to investigate whether this technique can help surgeons performing standard lymphadenectomy and selecting cases for D2\\u2009+\\u2009lymphadenectomy. This study investigated benefits of routine panendoscopy in staging of oral squamous cell cancer patients.\\nFrom 2013 to 2017, 194 oral squamous cell cancer patients were staged. Reports of routine flexible panendoscopy including oropharyngolaryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were retrospectively analyzed for diagnoses of inflammation and second primary malignancies (carcinoma in situ or cancer) and compared to results of computed tomography. The effects of alcohol and tobacco history of 142 patients were assessed.\\nOverall, a second primary malignancy was detected in seven patients. In four patients this discovery was only found by panendoscopy. One invasive carcinoma (esophagus) was detected as well as three carcinoma in situ. The second primary malignancies were located in the lung (3), esophagus (3), and stomach (1). In one patient index tumor therapy was modified after panendoscopy. Upper gastrointestinal inflammation was present in 73.2% of patients and 61.9% required treatment. About 91.8% of bronchoscopies and 34.5% of panendoscopies were without therapeutic consequences. Patients with higher risk from smoking were more likely to benefit from panendoscopy and to have a Helicobacter pylori infection.\\nWe do not recommend routine panendoscopy for all oral squamous cell cancer patients. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy benefitted smoking patients primarily concerning the secondary diagnosis of inflammation of the upper digestive tract. Selective bronchoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and oropharyngolaryngoscopy should be performed if clinical examination or medical history indicates risks for additional malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract.\\nRoutine panendoscopy is not recommended in all, especially not in low-risk oral cancer patients like non-smokers and non-drinkers. Recurrence risk is a major concern after endoscopic resection (ER) of gastric neoplasms. This study was to compare metachronous risk in patients with and without synchronous neoplasms after complete ER.\\nAfter ER for gastric neoplasms, patients were divided into those with and without synchronous neoplasm. The metachronous risk of gastric neoplasms was compared between the two groups.\\nAfter ER of 678 cancers and 891 adenomas, synchronous neoplasm was found in 11.8% of cancers and 11.4% of adenomas. In the multiple (n\\u2009=\\u2009182) and the single group (n\\u2009=\\u20091387), metachronous neoplasms occurred in 18.1 and 8.6%, respectively (HR 2.40; 95% CI, 1.62-3.34). When the pathology of the recurred lesion was limited to cancer, metachronous risk was also significantly higher in the multiple than in the single group (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.17-3.85). In the recurred pathology of the multiple group, cancer development was frequently observed in patients with cancer compared to those with only adenomas in the synchronous lesion (67.0% vs. 13.0%, respectively; P\\u2009=\\u20090.023).\\nThis study demonstrated that metachronous risk was significantly higher in patients with synchronous gastric neoplasms after ER. Therefore, meticulous examination is important in patients with synchronous neoplasm. Gastric digests from mung (MBS) and adzuki (ABS) bean sprouts enriched with probiotic  After a gastrectomy, the nutritional status of patients with gastric cancer has great effect on the treatment outcome and patients\\' quality of life. We investigated the changes in body composition and nutrient intake after gastrectomy in 288 gastric cancer patients. A multiple linear regression analysis was used for each time period to verify the effects of nutritional and clinical factors on weight and fat-free mass loss rates. Gastric cancer patients who underwent a gastrectomy continued to experience weight and fat-free mass loss until three months after surgery and became stagnant at six months. The marginal mean of calorie intake per weight was 24.5, 26.8, and 29.4 kcal at one, three, and six months. The protein intake per kg lean mass was 1.14, 1.14, and 1.16 g at one, three, and six months, respectively. One month after surgery, the rate of weight loss increased significantly in females who received chemotherapy ( Silibinin is the major component of flavonolignans complex mixture (Silymarin), which is obtained from Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. Despite several reports about silibinin, little is known about its effects on gastric diseases. Then, the present study aims to evaluate the silibinin effect against Helicobacter pylori infection, gastric tumor cells and immunomodulation.\\nThe anti-H. pylori effect was performed on 43504 and 43629 strains by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, observing morphological alterations by scanning electron microscopy and in silico evaluation by molecular docking. Immunomodulatory activity (Interleukins-6 and 10, TNF-α and NO inhibition) was determined in H. pylori-stimulated macrophages and the cytotoxic activity on gastric adenocarcinoma cells prior and after metabolization by S9 fraction.\\nSilibinin showed anti-H. pylori activity with MIC of 256\\xa0μg/mL, promoted important morphological changes in the bacterial cell wall, as blebs and clusters, suggesting interaction with Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) subunits. Immunomodulatory potential was observed at 50\\xa0μg/mL with the inhibition of produced cytokines and NO by H. pylori-stimulated macrophages of 100% for TNF-ɑ, 56.83% for IL-6, and 70.29% for IL-10 and 73.33% for NO. Moreover, silibinin demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity on adenocarcinoma cells (CI\\nThe use of silibinin may become an important alternative tool in the prevention and treatment of H. pylori infection and, consequently, in gastric cancer. The present study is aimed at investigating the prognostic value and association of systemic inflammation (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-to-monocytes ratio) for patients with stage IV gastric cancer.\\nIn this retrospective study, patients with stage IV gastric cancer between January 2008 and December 2017 were included. A summary was performed on clinicopathological characteristics and a multivariate cox regression analysis was performed to identify the prognostic factors.\\n304 patients with stage IV gastric cancer were included in the study. On multivariate analysis, the systemic chemotherapy (p < .001), the jaundice (p = .004), the high neutrophil-to-lym- phocyte ratio (p = .005) and the high platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = .041) were independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IV gastric cancer.\\nAs systemic inflammation response markers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio are significantly associated with OS for stage IV gastric cancer patients. Systemic chemotherapy shows a clear overall survival benefit in patients with stage IV gastric cancer and Jaundice indicates poor overall survival. We studied the relation between premalignant gastric lesions and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression.\\nThe study included 254 patients, who were histo- logically diagnosed with chronic active gastritis, atrophy, dys- plasia and metaplasia. Gastric biopsy specimens of the patients were histopathologically examined in terms of the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, atrophy The Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment ; (OLGA staging system), dysplasia (Vienna classification), and metaplasia (Sydney classification). COX-2 expression was investigated by immunohistochemical staining. COX-2 immunoreactivity score was calculated as the product of staining intensity and staining area. A score of >1 was defined as COX-2-positive expression.\\nOf these patients, 84 (33.1%) had negative COX-2 expression (Score 0 and Score 1) and 170 (66.9%) had positive COX2 expression (Score 2 and Score 3). We found that in patients with a moderate-marked metaplasia, or with moderate-severe atrophy, a higher OLGA stage, or with dysplasia, the COX-2 expression was found to be higher than those with mild lesions. In 59.8% of the patients H. pylori was positive. While, the rate of severe atrophy was higher in H. pylori-positive patients ; no significant difference was determined between the H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative patients regarding age, smoking status, intestinal metaplasia grade, dysplasia, and COX-2 expression.\\nWe found a relation between the level of COX-2 expression and the grade of premalignant gastric lesions. COX-2 plays an important role in the gradual process resulting eventually in gastric cancer. In accordance with the Asian BRCA Consortium data, there is a significant difference in incidence rate of breast cancer depending on age, as well as spectrum and prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations between Mongoloid (East Asian) and Caucasoid (European) people. However, European strategies to identify familial BC are still applied to the Asian population, including Russian Mongoloids (Khakas, Buryats, Tyvans and Yakuts and others). The main purpose of the study was to identify molecular changes associated with hereditary BC in Russian Mongoloid BC patients (Buryats). Thirty-nine patients were included in the study. Genomic DNA extracted from lymphocytes was used to prepare DNA-libraries. Target sequencing was designed to cover 27 genes, such as ATM, APC, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2 and others. Paired-end sequencing (2\\u2009×\\u2009150\\xa0bp) was conducted on a NextSeq 500 system (Illumina, USA). Three pathogenic mutations in non-BRCA genes were found (prevalence of 8%). The pathogenic mutations were found in the RAD51D and PTEN genes. The pathogenic variant in the RAD51D gene (rs137886232, NC_000017.10:g.33428366G>A, p.R141X) was observed in two unrelated individuals aged under 40.\\xa0One of these patients had a family history of late-onset stomach cancer in second-degree relatives.\\xa0The pathogenic mutation in the PTEN gene (rs786201044, NC_000010.10:g.89692922T>C, p.C136R) was observed in a 38\\xa0years old breast cancer patient with no family history. In our study, we first describe pathogenic mutations in RAD51D and PTEN genes found in young Buryat patients. Master splicing regulator MBNL1 shapes large transcriptomic changes that drive cellular differentiation during development. Here we demonstrate that MBNL1 is a suppressor of tumor dedifferentiation. We surveyed  There is no clear agreement on the type of gastrectomy to be used (either total [TG] or distal [DG]) in middle or distal gastric cancer, especially when it is undifferentiated or Lauren diffuse type. In this meta-analysis, we intend to define which of the 2techniques should be recommended, based on survival, morbidity and mortality rates. Prospective and retrospective studies comparing both techniques have been included for a total of 6303 patients (3,641 DG and 2,662 TG). DG was significantly associated with fewer complications, fewer anastomotic fistulae, and less perioperative mortality. The number of lymph nodes in DG was significantly lower, but always above 15. Finally, even the 5-year survival of DG was also higher. Therefore, DG, as long as a safety margin is obtained and regardless of the histological type, should be performed in surgery for distal stomach cancer. High microsatellite instability (MSI) is related to good prognosis in gastric cancer. We aimed to identify the prognostic factors of patients with recurrent gastric cancer and investigate the role of MSI as a prognostic and predictive biomarker of survival after tumor recurrence.\\nThis retrospective cohort study enrolled patients treated for stage II/III gastric cancer who developed tumor recurrence and in whom the MSI status or mismatch repair (MMR) status of the tumor was known. MSI status and the expression of MMR proteins were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively.\\nOf the 790 patients included, 64 (8.1%) had high MSI status or MMR deficiency. The tumor-node-metastasis stage, type of recurrence, Lauren classification, chemotherapy after recurrence, and interval to recurrence were independently associated with survival after tumor recurrence. The MSI/MMR status and receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were not associated with survival after recurrence. In a subgroup analysis of patients with high MSI or MMR-deficient gastric cancer, those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy had better treatment response to chemotherapy after recurrence than those who received adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nPatients with high MSI/MMR-deficient gastric cancer should be spared from adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, but aggressive chemotherapy after recurrence should be considered. Higher tumor-node-metastasis stage, Lauren classification, interval to recurrence, and type of recurrence are associated with survival after tumor recurrence and should thus be considered when establishing a treatment plan and designing clinical trials targeting recurrent gastric cancer. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status may affect the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer. In this study, the clinical characteristics of MSI-high (MSI-H) gastric cancer and the predictive value of MSI-H for adjuvant chemotherapy in large cohorts of gastric cancer patients were evaluated.\\nThis study consisted of two cohorts. Cohort 1 included gastric cancer patients who received curative resection with pathologic stage IB-IIIC. Cohort 2 included patients with MSI-H gastric cancer who received curative resection with pathologic stage II/III. MSI was examined using two mononucleotide markers and three dinucleotide markers.\\nOf 359 patients (cohort 1), 41 patients (11.4%) had MSI-H. MSI-H tumors were more frequently identified in older patients (p < 0.001), other histology than poorly cohesive, signet ring cell type (p=0.005), intestinal type (p=0.028), lower third tumor location (p=0.005), and absent perineural invasion (p=0.027). MSI-H status has a tendency of better disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in multivariable analyses (hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; p=0.059 and HR, 0.4; p=0.063, respectively). In the analysis of 162 MSI-H patients (cohort 2), adjuvant chemotherapy showed a significant benefit with respect to longer DFS and OS (p=0.047 and p=0.043, respectively). In multivariable analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy improved DFS (HR, 0.4; p=0.040).\\nMSI-H gastric cancer had distinct clinicopathologic findings. Even in MSI-H gastric cancer of retrospective cohort, adjuvant chemotherapy could show a survival benefit, which was in contrast to previous prospective studies and should be investigated in a further prospective trial. It is important to understand the differences between men and women when it comes to attitudes and risk perception toward disease. This study aimed to explore the fear of cancer from the standpoint of themselves and the opposite sex by cancer type.\\nA cross-sectional survey with a representative sample was conducted.\\nThe least and the most feared cancers in men were thyroid cancer and lung cancer, respectively. When men assumed the perspective of women, the least and the most feared cancer were thyroid cancer and stomach cancer, respectively. The least and the most feared cancers in women were thyroid cancer and stomach cancer, respectively. When women assumed the perspective of men, the least and the most feared cancer were prostate cancer and lung cancer, respectively. When both men and women assume the perspective of the opposite sex, the fear of sex-specific cancer was relatively low compared to the actual responses of both men and women. The top six of the most feared side effects of cancer treatment were pain, psychological problems, general weakness, digestive dysfunction, fatigue, and appearance change. These were the same between men and women.\\nHealth care providers and caregivers in the family should provide care with more attention to the differences in thoughts about cancer between men and women. Health care providers should provide care with more attention to the differences in these problems between men and women. We aimed to investigate the impact of muscle atrophy and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a sub-clinical biomarker of inflammation and nutrition, on the prognosis of patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer. We retrospectively enrolled 109 patients with stage IV gastric cancer (median age 69 years; female/male 22%/78%; median observational period 261 days). Independent factors and profiles for overall survival (OS) were determined by Cox regression analysis and decision-tree analysis, respectively. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prevalence of muscle atrophy was 82.6% and the median NLR was 3.15. In Cox regression analysis, none of factors were identified as an independent factor for survival. The decision-tree analysis revealed that the most favorable prognostic profile was non-muscle atrophy (OS rate 36.8%). The most unfavorable prognostic profile was the combination of muscle atrophy and high NLR (OS rate 19.6%). The OS rate was significantly lower in patients with muscle atrophy and high NLR than in patients with non-muscle atrophy (1-year survival rate 28.5% vs. 54.7%; log-rank test  An 82 year-old man had received left hepatectomy with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy due to hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Fig. 1a). A nasogastric tube was inserted for enteral nutrition due to poor oral intake caused by late-onset liver failure, but was often self-removed. Endoscopic gastrostomy was failed because the blind end of the elevated jejunum entered the ventral side of the stomach (Fig. 1b). The development of peptic ulcer (PU) and gastric cancer (GC) is the result of the interaction of various internal and external factors. Moreover, if the role ofHelicobacter pylori(H. pylori) in the development of diseases of the stomach is fully established, the significance of many other factors continues to be discussed. Serious controversy is caused by the participation of various strains ofH. pyloriin the development of PU and GC. First of all, these are Vac- and Cag-positive strains ofH. pylori. The role of genetic human polymorphism in the development of this pathology is debatable. Especially the interleukin genes and necrotizing tumor factor alpha. The role of environmental factors in the formation of PU and GC is not fully understood. So, the role of alcohol, occupational hazards and drugs in the development of these diseases continues to be discussed. Further study of risk factors for various diseases of the stomach will optimize their prevention and treatment. The review presents a modern view of individual issues in the pathogenesis of PU and GC.\\nРазвитие язвенной болезни (ЯБ) и рака желудка (РЖ) является результатом взаимодействия различных внутренних и внешних факторов. При этом если рольHelicobacter pylori(H. pylori) в развитии заболеваний желудка полностью установлена, то значение многих других факторов продолжает обсуждаться. Серьезные споры вызывает участие различных штаммовH. pyloriв развитии ЯБ и РЖ. Прежде всего это Vac- и Cag-позитивные штаммыH. pylori. Дискуссионной является роль генетического полиморфизма человека в развитии данной патологии, особенно генов интерлейкинов и фактора некроза опухоли. Не в полной мере понятна роль средовых факторов в формировании ЯБ и РЖ. Так, продолжает обсуждаться роль алкоголя, профессиональных вредностей и лекарственных препаратов в развитии этих заболеваний. Дальнейшее исследование факторов риска различных заболеваний желудка позволит оптимизировать их профилактику и лечение. В обзоре представлен современный взгляд на отдельные вопросы патогенезе ЯБ и РЖ. To establish the main external and genetically determined risk factors for the development of hepatocellular cancer in the ethnic group of male Yakuts living in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) [RS (Y)] in the epidemiologically unfavorable conditions of the incidence of viral hepatitis.\\nA total of 97 male Yakuts were examined, including 44 people diagnosed with hepatocellular cancer and 53 people diagnosed with chronic viral hepatitis. HCC risk factors were identified by analyzing medical records and questioning patients. In the experimental and control groups, genetic studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes mapped on the X-chromosome and involved in the activation of antiviral immunity along the TLR7 signaling pathway were performed.\\nIn 100% of patients with hepatocellular cancer, infection with hepatitis B, C, D viruses or co - infection with these agents was detected. Every fourth patient with HCC in the RS (Y) was infected with hepatitis D. The course of hepatocellular cancer associated with HDV was characterized by rapid progression of liver cirrhosis, development of portal hypertension, bleeding from varicose veins of the stomach and esophagus (36.4%) and edematous ascitic syndrome (63.6%). In addition to viral agents, additional risk factors for liver cancer were identified, such as alcohol abuse, overweight, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Among the studied variation sites of genes localized on the X-chromosome and encoding the reaction of innate antiviral immunity, no genetic marker was found with a sufficient degree of confidence determining the likelihood of hepatocellular cancer developing.\\nThe high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma of the male population in the RS (Y) is due to the widespread prevalence of parenteral viral hepatitis, especially viral hepatitis D. Due to the introduction of mass vaccination of the population against hepatitis B in the Russian Federation in the foreseeable future in the RS (Y) we should see a decrease in the proportion of hepatocellular cancer associated with hepatitis B and D viruses, and therefore the focus should be on the treatment and prevention of hepatitis C virus and non - infectious risk factors.\\nЦель исследования. Установить основные внешние и генетически детерминированные факторы риска развития гепатоцеллюлярного рака (ГЦР) в этнической группе якутов - мужчин, проживающих на территории Республики Саха (Якутия) [РС (Я)] в условиях эпидемиологического неблагополучия по заболеваемости вирусными гепатитами. Материалы и методы. Обследовано 97 якутов мужского пола, в том числе с диагнозом ГЦР - 44 человека, с диагнозом хронический вирусный гепатит - 53 человека. Факторы риска ГЦР выявляли путем анализа медицинской документации и анкетированного опроса больных. В опытной и контрольной группах выполнены генетические исследования однонуклеотидных полиморфизмов генов, картированных на Х-хромосоме и участвующих в активации противовирусного иммунитета по TLR7-сигнальному пути. Результаты и обсуждение. У 100% больных ГЦР обнаружено инфицирование вирусами гепатитов B, C, D или ко - инфекция указанными агентами. Каждый 4-й больной ГЦР в РС (Я) оказался инфицирован вирусом гепатита D (HDV). Течение ГЦР, ассоциированного с HDV, характеризовалось быстрым прогрессированием цирроза печени, развитием портальной гипертензии, кровотечением из варикозно расширенных вен желудка и пищевода и отечно - асцитическим синдромом. Кроме вирусных агентов выявлены дополнительные факторы риска развития рака печени, такие как злоупотребление алкоголем, избыточная масса тела, сахарный диабет, табакокурение. Среди исследованных вариационных сайтов генов, локализованных на Х-хромосоме и кодирующих реакции врожденного противовирусного иммунитета, не обнаружено генетического маркера с достаточной степенью достоверности детерминирующего вероятность развития ГЦР. Заключение. Высокая заболеваемость ГЦР мужского населения в РС (Я) обусловлена широким распространением парентеральных вирусных гепатитов, в особенности HDV. В связи с внедрением в Российской Федерации массовой вакцинации населения против гепатита В, в обозримом будущем в РС (Я) следует ожидать снижение доли ГЦР, ассоциированной с вирусами гепатитов B и D, в связи с чем основное внимание должно быть уделено лечению и профилактике вирусного гепатита С и неинфекционным факторам риска. Excess levels of nitrite ion in drinking water interact with amine functionalized compounds to form carcinogenic nitrosamines, which cause stomach cancer. Thus, it is indispensable to develop a simple protocol to detect nitrite. In this paper, a Cu-metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF) with graphene oxide (GO) composite was synthesized by ultrasonication followed by solvothermal method and then fabricated on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode for the sensitive and selective determination of nitrite contamination. The SEM image of the synthesized Cu-MOF showed colloidosome-like structure with an average size of 8 μm. Interestingly, the Cu-MOF-GO composite synthesized by ultrasonic irradiation followed by solvothermal process produce controlled size of 3 μm colloidosome-like structure. This was attributed to the formation of an exfoliated sheet-like structure of GO by ultrasonication in addition to the obvious influence of GO providing the oxygen functional groups as a nucleation node for size-controlled growth. On the other hand, the composite prepared without ultrasonication exhibited 6.6 μm size agglomerated colloidosome-like structures, indicating the crucial role of ultrasonication for the formation of size-controlled composites. XPS results confirmed the presence of Cu(II) in the as-synthesized Cu-MOF-GO based on the binding energies at 935.5 eV for Cu 2p miR-205 is a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in tumor invasiveness. However, the role of miR-205 in human gastric cancer (GC) epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of miR-205 in the regulation of EMT in GC invasion.\\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-205 in GC. Further, the correlation between the pathological parameters and prognosis of GC was statistically analyzed. A transwell model was used to evaluate the effect of miR-205-3p on the invasion and migration of GC cells. qPCR, western blotting, and luciferase assay were performed to analyze the relationship and target effects between miR-205-3p and the expression of zinc finger electron box binding homologous box 1 (ZEB1) and 2 (ZEB2).\\nWe found that the levels of miR-205-3p were significantly lower (P<0.05) in GC tissues than in matched normal tissues. Additionally, the expression of miR-205-3p was related to the tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, lymph node invasion, and tumor, node, metastasis stage. Patients with lower miR-205-3p expression levels in the tumors had a poorer prognosis. The in vitro assays indicated that miR-205-3p could affect the invasion ability and EMT of GC cells by targeting the expression of both ZEB1 and ZEB2.\\nmiR-205-3p promotes GC progression and affects the prognosis of patients by targeting both ZEB1 and ZEB2 to directly influence EMT. This study sought to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in relation to tumor location within the stomach.\\nThe densities and prognostic significance of TIL subsets were evaluated in 542 gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy. Immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD4, CD8, forkhead/winged helix transcription factor (Foxp3), and granzyme B was performed.\\nCardia cancer was associated with significantly lower densities of CD8 T-cells and higher densities of Foxp3 and granzyme B T-cells than non-cardia tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.023; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.006-1.040), advanced T classification (HR, 2.029; 95% CI, 1.106-3.721), lymph node metastasis (HR, 3.319; 95% CI, 1.947-5.658), low CD3 expression (HR, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.994-0.999), and a high Foxp3/CD4 ratio (HR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.001-1.012) were independent predictors of poor overall survival in cardia cancer patients. In non-cardia cancer patients, total gastrectomy (HR, 2.147; 95% CI, 1.507-3.059), advanced T classification (HR, 2.158; 95% CI, 1.425-3.266), lymph node metastasis (HR, 1.854; 95% CI, 1.250-2.750), and a low Foxp3/CD4 ratio (HR, 0.978; 95% CI, 0.959-0.997) were poor prognostic factors for survival.\\nThe densities and prognostic effects of TILs differed in relation to the location of tumors within the stomach. The contrasting prognostic effects of Foxp3/CD4 ratio in cardia and non-cardia gastric cancer patients suggests that clinicians ought to consider tumor location when determining treatment strategies. This study evaluated differences and shifting patterns in the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of 5-year gastric cancer survivors after either a distal subtotal gastrectomy (DSG) or total gastrectomy (TG).\\nWe analyzed the prospectively collected HRQoL data of 528 patients who survived 5 years without recurrence using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core Quality of Life Questionnaire and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Stomach module according to the type of surgery. The purpose was to identify the proportion of patients with deteriorating HRQoL and to assess the clinical significance of these changes.\\nDeteriorating HRQoL was prevalent in both groups, including a large proportion of the DSG group. Decreased overall health status and scores on several function scales were less in the DSG group, while increases on the symptom scales were higher in the TG group. For most of the scales, gaps in HRQoL during the early postoperative period did not merge within the 5 years. Scores on the diarrhea and body image scales revealed \"moderate changes\" in both groups.\\nDuring the 5-year period after surgery, the TG group suffered from inferior HRQoL compared to the DSG group. However, a large proportion of the DSG group also suffered HRQoL deterioration. In general, the TG group experienced more HRQoL decline, with diarrhea and body image being the major concerns for both groups. To improve HRQoL after gastrectomy, patients must be better informed about post-gastrectomy symptoms. These symptoms must be vigorously investigated, and medical interventions should be available parallel to nutritional support. Favorable evidence of function-preserving gastrectomy should be established and disseminated to improve the HRQoL of early gastric cancer patients. The guidelines for pathological evaluation of early gastric cancer (EGC) recommend wider section intervals for surgical specimens (5-7 mm) than those for endoscopically resected specimens (2-3 mm). Studies in surgically resected EGC specimens showed not negligible lymph node metastasis risks in EGCs meeting the expanded criteria for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).\\nThis retrospective study included 401 EGC lesions with an endoscopic size of ≤ 30 mm detected in 386 patients. Pathological specimens obtained by ESD or surgery were cut into 2-mm section intervals for reference. Submucosal or lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was evaluated arbitrarily in 4- or 6-mm section intervals. McNemar\\'s tests compared the differences between submucosal and LVI.\\nSubmucosal invasion was detected in 29.2% (117/401) and LVI in 9.5% (38/401) at 2-mm interval. The submucosal invasion detection rates in 4-mm intervals decreased to 88.0% or 90.6% (both P<0.001), while the LVI detection rates decreased to 86.8% or 57.9% (P=0.025 and P<0.001, respectively). In 6-mm intervals, the submucosal and LVI detection rates decreased further to 72.7-80.3% (P<0.001 for all three sets) and 55.3-63.2% (P<0.001 for all three sets), respectively. Among 150 out-of-indication cases at 2-mm interval, 4-10 (2.7%-6.7%) at 4-mm intervals, and 10-17 (6.7%-11.3%) at 6-mm intervals were misclassified as lesions meeting the curative resection criteria due to the underestimation of submucosal or LVI.\\nAfter ESD, the 2-mm wide section interval was suitable for the pathological evaluation of focal submucosal or LVI. Thus, if an EGC lesion meets the expanded criteria for the ESD specimen pathological evaluation, it could be safely followed up. Globally, there is a high incidence of gastric cancer (GC). Leucine zipper-EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) is reported to play a vital role in several human malignancies. However, there is limited understanding of the role of LETM1 in GC. This study aims to investigate the effects of LETM1 on proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells.\\nThe expression levels of LETM1 in the normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells (GES-1) and GC cells were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. CCK-8, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays were performed to evaluate the effect of LETM1 knockdown or overexpression on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of the GC cells, respectively. Additionally, the effect of LETM1 knockdown or overexpression on GC cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the effect of LETM1 knockdown or overexpression on the expression levels of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway-related proteins was evaluated by western blotting.\\nThe GC cells exhibited markedly higher mRNA and protein expression levels of LETM1 than the GES-1 cells. Additionally, the knockdown of LETM1 remarkably suppressed the GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted the apoptosis of GC cells, which were reversed upon LETM1 overexpression. Furthermore, the western blotting analysis indicated that LETM1 facilitates GC progression via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.\\nLETM1 acts as an oncogenic gene to promote GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, LETM1 may be a potential target for GC diagnosis and treatment. This study was conducted to determine whether establishing the proximal resection line using India ink tattooing can ensure safe resection margins during totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.\\nThis retrospective study included 81 patients who underwent totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer on the lower two-thirds of the stomach. The proximal resection margins were analyzed with respect to the macroscopic type and clinical T stage, and the intraoperative appearance of the stain on the serosa was classified by reviewing surgical videos.\\nR0 resection was performed in all patients. The rates of the intended margins were 89.2% in patients without a frozen section diagnosis and 84.2% in patients with differentiated type lesions who underwent a frozen section diagnosis; however, most patients with undifferentiated advanced lesions failed to achieve the intended resection margins. Intraoperative appearance revealed that 85.2% of patients had localized type stains, whereas 11.1% had widespread-type stains.\\nOur procedure to determine the proximal resection line in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is oncologically safe. However, careful observation of the resected specimen and a frozen section analysis should be performed for undifferentiated advanced lesions. None Increasing evidence demonstrates that tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) exert important effects and are dysregulated in various human cancer types. However, their roles in gastric cancer (GC) remain unknown. Here we identified the functional effects of tRF-3019a (derived from tRNA-Ala-AGC-1-1) in GC. We demonstrated that tRF-3019a was upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Phenotypic studies revealed that tRF-3019a overexpression enhances GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Conversely, tRF-3019a knockdown inhibits GC cell malignant activities. Mechanistic investigation implies that tRF-3019a directly regulates tumor suppressor gene FBXO47. Furthermore, tRF-3019a levels may discriminate GC tissues from nontumorous tissues. Taken together, our results reveal that tRF-3019a modulates GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting FBXO47, and it may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for GC. The current study aimed to analyze the sex differences in cancer mortality rates in Japan via an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis.\\nWe used data about cancer mortality rates from 1995 to 2015 in Japan based on the Vital Statistics survey. In addition to the data about mortality from all sites of cancer, we specifically used data about stomach, lung, colorectal, and liver cancers. A Bayesian APC analysis was performed to identify changes in mortality rates based on three effects, which were as follows: age, period, and cohort. Then, we finally calculated the mortality rate ratios for each effect between men and women.\\nThe sex differences in age-adjusted mortality rates for all-sites cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer were decreasing from 1995 to 2015, and the mortality rate ratios in terms of sex decreased from 2.17 in 1995 to 1.93 in 2015. Based on the results of the APC analyses, only minimal changes were observed in the mortality rate ratios for all types of cancer between men and women during the analyzed periods. The cohort effects began to decrease from the early 20th century in all types of cancer in both men and women, and the mortality rate ratios for all types of cancer between men and women began to increase in the cohorts born from 1926 to 1935. For all-sites cancer, the ratio increased from 0.49 (0.44, 0.57) in the cohort born from 1926 to 1930 to 0.81 (0.60, 1.03) in the cohort born from 1971 to 1975.\\nThe sex differences in cancer mortality rates were decreasing in the more recent born generations in Japan. If this trend continues, there will be a minimal difference in the morality rates in the following generations.<br />. Gastric cancer is known as one of the most common cancers and causes of deaths. Early and proper diagnosis is one of the most important things for treatment response. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the expression of p53, CD44, Ki-67, and HER-2/neu markers in the gastric cancer and its relationship with histopathological indicators.\\nThis is a descriptive-analytical study, in which 60 patients with cancer who underwent gastrectomy surgery in 2011-2016 in Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital. The participants were investigated for p53, CD44, Ki-67, and HER-2/neu markers\\' staining plus demographic characteristics, rate of survival, and histopathological features of the tumors.\\nThe mean age of the participants (44 males and 16 females) was 60.25±1.29 years. The patients\\' survival rate was 23.82±1.56 months on average. The tumor size was reported as 6.09±2.61 mm and the major tumor type reported was intestinal type (n=40, 66.7%). The level of expression of Ki-67 and CD44 makers was recorded as 33.75 and 24.50%, and p53 and HER-2/neu genes were positive in 25 (41.7%) and 20 (33.3%) patients, respectively. The expression of p53 and CD44 markers had no significant relationship with the demographic characteristics, rate of survival, and histopathological features of the tumor of patients (all p>0.05). The expression of p53 gene was associated with the lower rate of survival (p=0.014), while the expression of HER-2/neu was associated with higher probability of developing intestinal type of stomach adenocarcinoma (p=0.010) and ulcerative macroscopic view (p=0.034).\\nThis study illustrated that p53 and CD44 markers did not have any diagnostic value in predicting the biological behavior of gastric cancer. In fact, incidence of p53 gene was associated with the lower rate of survival, and the expression of HER-2/neu was associated with higher probability of developing the intestinal type of stomach adenocarcinoma and ulcerative macroscopic view. How gastric cancer (GC) incidence is associated with changes in the gastric microbiome has not been firmly established. The present study therefore aims to investigate the microbial communities present within the gastric mucosa of patients with superficial gastritis (SG) or GC.\\nPaired tumor and paracancerous samples of the gastric mucosa were collected from 18 patients being surgically treated for GC and from 32 patients with SG being treated via gastroscopy. The gastric microbiome in these samples was then profiled via 16S rRNA sequencing, with a linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) approach used to identify and compare different bacteria, and with PICRUSt used for predictive functional analyses.\\nGC patients exhibited a distinct gastric microbiota profile from that observed in SG patients. These changes were evident in both tumor and paracancerous tissues from GC patients. Specifically, we found that 6 bacterial genera were specifically enriched in GC tissue samples relative to SG samples, while 18 genera were depleted in these same samples. Based on the differential abundance of these bacteria, we were able to calculate microbial dysbiosis index (MDI) values, which were significantly higher in GC patients than in SG patients. In addition, MDI values were negatively correlated with gastric Shannon index and were positively correlated with relative Helicobacter spp. abundance. Importantly, these MDI values were readily able to discriminate between GC and SG patient samples. Functional analysis suggested that GC patients were more likely to harbor a nitrosating microbial community.\\nGC patients exhibited a gastric microbiome profile distinct from that observed in SG patients, with these differences being evident in both tumor and paracancerous tissues. Differences in the relative abundance of Helicobacter spp. may be the primary driver of gastric dysbiosis in GC patients. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple independent cancer susceptibility loci at chromosome 8q24. We aimed to evaluate the associations between variants in the 8q24 region and cancer susceptibility. A comprehensive research synopsis and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate associations between 28 variants in 8q24 and risk of 7 cancers using data from 103 eligible articles totaling 146,932 cancer cases and 219,724 controls. Results: 20 variants were significantly associated with risk of prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, stomach cancer, and glioma, including 1 variant associated with prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and thyroid cancer. Cumulative epidemiological evidence of an association was graded as strong for DG8S737 -8 allele, rs10090154, rs7000448 in prostate cancer, rs10808556 in colorectal cancer, rs55705857 in gliomas, rs9642880 in bladder cancer, moderate for rs16901979, rs1447295, rs6983267, rs7017300, rs7837688, rs1016343, rs620861, rs10086908 associated in prostate cancer, rs10505477, rs6983267 in colorectal cancer, rs6983267 in thyroid cancer, rs13281615 in breast cancer, and rs1447295 in stomach cancer, weak for rs6983561, rs13254738, rs7008482, rs4242384 in prostate cancer. Data from ENCODE suggested that these variants with strong evidence and other correlated variants might fall within putative functional regions. Our study provides summary evidence that common variants in the 8q24 are associated with risk of multiple cancers in this large-scale research synopsis and meta-analysis. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying variants in the 8q24 involved in various human cancers. Gastric cancer (GC) is the most prevailing digestive tract malignant tumor worldwide with high mortality and recurrence rates. However, its potential molecular mechanism and prognostic biomarkers are still not fully understood. We aim to screen novel prognostic biomarkers related to GC prognosis using comprehensive bioinformatic tools.\\nFour gene expression microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE26942, GSE33335, GSE63089, and GSE79973). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between gastric carcinoma and normal gastric tissue samples were identified by an integrated bioinformatic analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed using statistical software R. STRING and Cytoscape software were employed to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Hub genes with a high score of connectivity identified from the PPI network were identified. Prognostic values of hub genes were evaluated in GSE15459 dataset. Hub genes related to GC overall survival were further validated in GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) online tool.\\nA total of 12 upregulated DEGs and 59 downregulated DEGs were identified when the 4 microarray data overlapped. Among them, 10 hub genes with a high score of connectivity were identified. High expression of ghrelin and obestatin prepropeptide (GHRL), BGN, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1, thrombospondin 2, secreted phosphoprotein 1, and low expression of CHGA were associated with a poor overall survival of gastric cancer (all log rank P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). After validation in GEPIA database, only GHRL was confirmed associated with a poor overall survival of gastric cancer (log rank P\\u200a=\\u200a.04).\\nGHRL could be used as a novel biomarker for the prediction of a poor overall survival of gastric cancer, and could be a novel therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment. However, future experimental studies are still required to validate these findings. In this study, we scrutinized the anticancer effects of FB-15 on human gastric carcinoma MGC-803\\xa0cells in vitro and vivo, and its preliminary effect on tubulin and HIF-1α. We confirmed that FB-15 not only inhibited the proliferation of a large number of cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner but also inhibited proliferation of a single cell to form clones. FB-15 manifested little cytotoxicity for normal stomach cells GES-1. The flow cytometry analysis displayed that FB-15 induced apoptosis MGC-803\\xa0cells and mainly arrested cells in the S phase in a concentration-dependent manner. The results of the wound healing assay indicated that FB-15 suppressed cell migration. Furthermore, the western blotting showed that FB-15 down-regulated the expression of β3-tubulin and HIF-1α, consistent with Immunohistochemical assay. The binding modes of FB-15 with tubulin were clarified by molecular docking. FB-15 significantly suppressed the growth of MGC-803 gastric cancer tumors. The inhibitory effect of FB-15 on tumor growth was superior to 5-Fu. Taken together, these results provided evidence for FB-15 to be used as an effective anticancer drug candidate for gastric cancer. Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf-2) is transcription factor implicated in the antioxidant response element-mediated induction of endogenous antioxidant enzyme such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase, and NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1, among which HO-1 is an enzyme catalyzing the degradation of heme.producing biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. In the stomach, as much as regulating gastric acid secretions, well-coordinated establishment of defense system stands for maintaining gastric integrity. In previous study, author et al. for the first time discovered HO-1 induction was critical in affording faithful gastric defense against various irritants including Helicobacter pylori infection, stress, alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and toxic bile acids. In this review article, we can add the novel evidence that dietary walnut intake can be reliable way to rescue from NSAIDs-induced gastrointestinal damages via the induction of HO-1 transcribed with Nrf-2 through specific inactivation of Keap-1. From molecular exploration to translational animal model of indomethacin-induced gastrointestinal damages, significant induction of HO-1 contributed to rescuing from damages. In addition to HO-1 induction action relevant to walnut, we added the description the general actions of walnut extracts or dietary intake of walnut regarding cytoprotection and why we have focused on to NSAID damages. Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, results in tumour response in around 15% of patients with advanced gastric cancer who have a PD-L1 combined positive score of at least 1. Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor of VEGF receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases, substantially decreased tumour-associated macrophages and increased infiltration of CD8 T cells, resulting in enhanced anti-tumour activity of PD-1 inhibitors in an in-vivo model. We aimed to assess the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer in a phase 2 study.\\nThis study was an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial undertaken at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Chiba, Japan). Eligible patients were aged 20 years or older and had metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1), irrespective of the number of previous lines of treatment. Patients received 20 mg oral lenvatinib daily plus 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks until disease progression, development of intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was objective response rate according to RECIST, analysed in all patients who were eligible and received protocol treatment at least once. The safety analysis included all those who received protocol treatment at least once, regardless of eligibility. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03609359, and enrolment is complete.\\nBetween Oct 15, 2018, and March 25, 2019, 29 patients were enrolled in the first-line or second-line settings. At data cutoff (March 20, 2020), the median follow-up was 12·6 months (IQR 10·5-14·3). 20 (69%, 95% CI 49-85) of 29 patients had an objective response. The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (in 11 [38%] patients), proteinuria (five [17%]), and platelet count decrease (two [7%]). No grade 4 treatment-related adverse events, serious treatment-related adverse events, or treatment-related deaths occurred.\\nLenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed promising anti-tumour activity with an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced gastric cancer. On the basis of these results, a confirmatory trial will be planned in the future.\\nMerck Sharp & Dohme. None The stomach and intestine are important organs for food digestion, nutrient absorption, immune protection and hormone production. Gastrointestinal diseases such as cancer and ulcer are big threats to human health. Appropriate disease models are in sore need for mechanistic understanding and drug discovery. Organoids are three-dimensional in vitro cultured structures derived from tissues and pluripotent stem cells with multiple types of cells and mimicking in vivo tissues in major aspects. They have a great potential in regenerative medicine and personalized medicine. Here, we review the major signaling pathways regulating gastrointestinal epithelial homeostasis, summarize different methods to generate human gastrointestinal organoids and highlight their applications in biological research and medical practice. Evidence is evolving that support the relationship that all carcinomas exhibit the following important relationships: The malignant cells exhibit a significant decreased zinc compared to the normal cells. The higher zinc levels that exist in the normal cells are cytotoxic in the malignant cells. The decrease in zinc is due to the down regulation of the ZIP-family zinc uptake transporter. These cells are as \"ZIP-deficient/decreased zinc\" malignancies. This provides a target for a chemotherapy that can restore the high zinc levels that will manifest cytotoxic effects in the malignant cells. In order to achieve this, a vehicle that facilitates the uptake and accumulation of zinc in the ZIP-deficient cells is required. The zinc ionophore, clioquinol, exhibits the properties that will provide these requirements. This is demonstrated by the treatment of a patient with 3% Clioquinol Cream, which successfully suppressed the progression of androgen-dependent prostate cancer. This treatment should also be efficacious for pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, gall bladder cancer, and lung cancer; which are carcinomas that exhibit decreased zinc. Thus, it is appropriate to describe that \"Zinc is the wonder drug for the treatment of carcinomas\". Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is an important enzyme in the proliferation and differentiation of all hematopoietic tissues. Its role as a cancer driver is well documented in liquid tumors; however, cumulative evidence has suggested an opposite role in other tumor types.\\nTo systematically assess the expression of \\nIn this bioinformatics study, Oncomine database and cBioPortal were used to study the \\nFrom 542 unique analyses of the \\nThe results of this study indicate the potential use of SYK as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for different type of cancers. However, further experimental data are required to validate these results before use of SYK in clinical settings. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) plays a role in the propagation of different types of cancers. It was identified in many types of cancer tissues like; breast, ovarian, lung, prostate, and stomach cancers. Therefore, inhibition of HER2 can lead to the discovery of novel anticancer agents.\\nThe study aims to discover a lead scaffold with drug-like properties and high affinity toward HER2 Methods: A list of HER2 inhibitors were collected, analyzed, and subjected to fragmentation and molecular docking. The in silico study computed the affinity, clash score, and ligand entropy score. A pharmacophore model for an ideal inhibitor designed, and tested against breast, lung, and prostatic cancer cell lines.\\nThe discovered lead compound achieved several hydrogen bonds with the primary residues found in the active site of HER2, such as; Met801, Gln99, Lys753, and Thr862 with a computational affinity - 13.45 kcal/mol. In addition to a hydrophobic interaction with leu800. The in vitro cytotoxic activity against; breast cancer MCF-7, prostatic cancer PC-3 and lung cancer A-549 cell lines showed (IC50 = 86.38 ±1.1 mmol/ml), (IC50 = 157.02 ±1.3 mmol/ml), and (IC50 = 181.1 ±2.4 mmol/ml) respectively.\\nThe discovered lead is an excellent drug-like candidate for further development and optimization. We aimed to assess the effect of a high-quality diet on the risk of upper gastrointestinal cancer and to evaluate the overall quality of our findings by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and the references of related articles to February 2020. Two reviewers independently retrieved the data and performed the quality assessments. We defined the highest-quality diet as that with the lowest Diet Inflammatory Index category and the highest Mediterranean Diet Score category. Overall odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for upper gastrointestinal cancer risk comparing the highest- versus lowest-diet quality. A random-effects meta-analysis was then applied with Review Manager, and the quality of the overall findings was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The highest-quality diets were significantly associated with reduced risk of upper gastrointestinal cancers, achieving odds ratios of 0.59 (95% confidence interval: 0.48-0.72) for the Diet Inflammatory Index, pooling the findings from nine studies, and 0.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-0.88) for the Mediterranean Diet Score, pooling the findings from 11 studies. We observed a minimum of 69% heterogeneity in the pooled results. The pooled results were graded as low quality of evidence. Although it may be possible to offer evidence-based general dietary advice for the prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancers, the evidence is currently of insufficient quality to develop dietary recommendations. Despite many known variables affecting the outcome, little is known about the impact of histology on the location of tumour and outcomes. The objective of our study was to describe pattern of gastric cancer at single centre and association with H. Pylori and Signet ring cell variant with site of tumour in stomach.\\nThis was a cross sectional study conducted at the Department of Surgery of Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 105 patients who underwent surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma were classified to have a proximal, distal or whole stomach cancer. An association was determined between the tumour histology and helicobacter pylori infection with the location of tumour in the stomach.\\nProximal gastric cancer was present in 27 (25.7%) patients and distal gastric cancer was present in 69 (65.7%) patients. There were 9 (8.6%) patients in whom tumour involved the whole stomach. Fifty-two patients (49.5%) had signet ring cell variant of gastric carcinoma and these patients were more like to have higher grade and advanced stage. Further analysis showed that that odds of proximal gastric tumour to have signet ring cell histopathology was 3.22 as compared to distal gastric tumour (p=0.017). Helicobacter Pylori infection status did not have any significant association with either grade of tumour or stage at the time of presentation.\\nDespite limitations our data suggests that proximal gastric cancer may be biologically different from distal gastric cancers in terms of frequency of signet ring cell histology. Primary gastric lymphoma is rare, representing 5% of all primary gastric neoplasms. The presenting complaints of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma are usually nonspecific. However, life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding from the stomach is unusual and sparsely reported. While studies reveal an indolent course, we present a case that presented with massive and recurrent hematemesis leading to hypovolemic shock secondary to endoscopically confirmed MALT lymphoma, which was treated with radiotherapy to achieve remission. She had no autoimmune diseases and tested negative for  Emerging studies have shown that HOTAIR acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer (GC). However, its role in the extracellular matrix and in tumor immune infiltration remains unknown.\\nHOTAIR and COL5A1 levels were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis and validated by qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays. The regulatory relationships between components of the HOTAIR/miR-1277-5p/COL5A1 axis and the role of this axis in GC were predicted by bioinformatics analysis, and validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The correlation between COL5A1 and GC immune infiltration was assessed by bioinformatics analysis and a COL5A1-based predictive nomogram was established using the Stomach Adenocarcinoma dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas.\\nWe found that HOTAIR and COL5A1 were overexpressed in GC compared to normal controls, which predicted poor prognosis. The regulatory relationship of the HOTAIR/miR-1277-5p/COL5A1 axis in GC was demonstrated, and HOTAIR and COL5A1 were found to promote GC growth while miR-1277-5p exerted the reverse effects. In addition, COL5A1 was negatively associated with tumor purity but positively associated with immune infiltration, which suggested that COL5A1-mediated GC growth may be partially mediated by the regulation of immune infiltration. Additionally, the established COL5A1-based nomogram showed that COL5A1 can serve as a prognostic biomarker in GC.\\nHOTAIR regulates GC growth by sponging miR-1277-5p and upregulating COL5A1, and COL5A1-mediated GC cell proliferation may be mediated by effects on the tumor microenvironment, which provides novel targets for GC treatment. Certain conflicting conclusions have been drawn that gastric xanthelasma is related to H.\\xa0pylori, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and early gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between gastric xanthelasma and upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic or pathological features. A cross‑sectional study was completed. A total of 8,634\\xa0patients who underwent stomach biopsy and who had no gastrectomy history were enrolled in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of gastric xanthelasma. The relationship between gastric xanthelasma and demographic characteristics (including age and sex), endoscopic features (including peptic ulcer, bile reflux, and gastric poly), or pathological features (including atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, H.\\xa0pylori, dysplasia, and gastric cancer) was analyzed. Age/sex matched analysis was also performed to exclude the influence of age and sex. The results revealed that out of the 8,634\\xa0patients, 3.54% patients had xanthelasma. Gastric xanthelasma was significantly associated with age (55.76 vs. 49.17\\xa0years, P<0.0001), duodenal ulcer (OR 0.860, 95%\\xa0CI 0.369‑0.923), atrophy (OR\\xa01.839, 95%\\xa0CI 1.432‑2.362), and intestinal metaplasia (OR\\xa03.296, 95%\\xa0CI 2.612‑4.159). Binary logistic analysis revealed that age (OR\\xa01.027, 95%\\xa0CI 1.017‑1.037) and intestinal metaplasia (OR\\xa02.700, 95%\\xa0CI 2.090‑3.487) were independently related to gastric xanthelasma. Age/sex matched control binary logistic analysis revealed that gastric xanthelasma was significantly associated with presence of intestinal metaplasia (OR\\xa02.338, 95%\\xa0CI 1.659‑3.297). There was no difference in the number (P=0.427) and location (P>0.05) of gastric xanthelasma for intestinal metaplasia. In conclusion, gastric xanthelasma may be an independent endoscopic warning sign of intestinal metaplasia. A 56-year-old man was diagnosed to have a huge gastric cancer extending from the lesser curvature of the stomach to the pancreas with multiple hepatic and peritoneal metastases. Two days after completing chemotherapy with cisplatin plus high dose leucovorin and fluorouracil, drastic necrotising tumour lysis led to gastric perforation and septic shock most likely due to bacterial peritonitis. The image of tumour lysis looked like an emphysematous pancreatitis. Afterwards, immunohistochemical study of the tumour specimen confirmed moderate positivity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and absence of Bcl-2 expression. The incomplete expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and total deficiency of Bcl-2 are considered to be the main underlying causes of such extraordinary chemosensitivity and so severe a tumour lysis phenomenon. Pre-emptive intensive survey of possible biomarkers of chemosensitivity is thus highly recommended upon treating a massive gastric cancer. Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is the fifth most prevalent cancer in the world and ranks third among cancer-related deaths worldwide. The tumour microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in tumorigenesis, development, and metastasis. Hence, we calculated the immune and stromal scores to find the potential prognosis-related genes in STAD using bioinformatics analysis.\\nThe ESTIMATE algorithm was used to calculate the immune/stromal scores of the STAD samples. Functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and overall survival analysis were then performed on differential genes. And we validated these genes using data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Finally, we used the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases to verify these genes at the protein levels by IHC.\\nData analysis revealed correlation between stromal/immune scores and the TNM staging system. The top 10 core genes extracted from the PPI network, and primarily involved in immune responses, extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion. There are 31 genes have been validated with poor prognosis and 16 genes were upregulated in tumour tissues compared with normal tissues at the protein level.\\nIn summary, we identified genes associated with the tumour microenvironment with prognostic implications in STAD, which may become potential therapeutic markers leading to better clinical outcomes. Gastric carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (NEDGC) is a relatively rare pathologic diagnosis in clinical practice, which has no specific guidelines or treatment recommendations yet. In this study, we aim to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of this disease.\\nWe retrospectively analyzed clinicopathological data from a series of 82 NEDGC patients who underwent surgery for gastrectomy at Huashan Hospital Fudan University between January 2007 and December 2018. Furthermore, a series of 50 cases were used to analyze 3-year overall survival (OS).\\nAges of the patients ranged from 26 to 83 years (M:F, 4.8:1). The majority of patients suffered from some symptoms (97.6%), as the most common one was abdominal pain (48.8%). Most of the tumors were ≥5 cm (53.7%), in the lower part of the stomach (47.5%), and with advanced T (87.8% ≥T3) and N (67.1% ≥N1) stage. As to the neuroendocrine markers, Syn showed a slight advantage on sensitivity than CgA (79.3 and 75.6%, respectively). The 3-year OS was 54%. Advanced T stage (≥T3) of the primary tumor, positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI), large tumor size (5.5cm), high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, 2.51), and low prealbumin level (173.87 mg/L) were associated with inferior OS based on the univariate analysis. Low preoperative hemoglobin level (113.87g/L), laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy, and advanced N stage (N3) were three independent risk factors for 3-year OS of NEDGC patients in both univariate and multivariate analysis.\\nThe TN staging system for gastric adenocarcinoma also has a prognostic value for NEDGC patients, while N3 stage works as an independent predictor of patients\\' survival. Since most of the NEDGC patients were in advanced stage, proper indications to perform operative laparoscopy should be selected. Gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is recommended for type 3 gastric neuroendocrine tumors (G-NETs). This study aimed to identify the risk factors for lymph node metastasis (LNM) arising from G-NETs to assess the suitability of endoscopic resection (ER).\\nNationwide clinicopathological data of patients with type 3 G-NETs who underwent surgery or ER were collected. A single pathologist graded the histological tumor specimens.\\nAmong 176 cases from 53 institutions, 144 were eligible for analysis (90 NET-G1 and 54 NET-G2 grade, 8-mm median-size tumors). Of these, 63 patients had undergone ER (15 with additional surgeries). Histological data regarding LNM were available for 93 surgical patients. LNM was confirmed in 15 (16%) tumors and was correlated with tumor diameter, invasion depth, and tumor grade. LNM was negative in six tumors ≤5\\xa0mm, confined to the mucosa or submucosa, with a grade of G1, and without lymphovascular invasion, but the number of cases was too small to propose ER indications. Among 48 patients treated with ER alone, only one developed recurrence; no mortality was observed at follow-up, although many patients were classified with SM2/NET-G2/tumors >5\\xa0mm. This suggests that not all LNMs arising from small G-NETs are fatal.\\nGastrectomy with lymphadenectomy for type 3 G-NETs is recommended on the basis of LNM. However, ER for type 3 G-NETs ≤10\\xa0mm, confined to the mucosa or submucosa, with a grade of G1 has shown excellent survival outcomes despite the risk of LNM, and therefore, could be an alternative treatment option. None The province of Cadiz, Spain, is a highly industrialized area with numerous registered industrial plants, which has led to major concern regarding the possible influence of these facilities on the high rate of cancer-related mortality observed. Our objective was to evaluate the association between digestive cancer mortality and proximity to industrial installations in the province of Cadiz over the period 1992-2014 and to analyse this risk according to different categories of carcinogenic substances. An ecological study at the census tract level was carried out. Mortality due to digestive cancer (involving the oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, colon and rectum) was analysed. Using the spatial Besag, York and Mollié (BYM) approach, we assessed the relative risk of dying from these cancers for people living between 500 m and 5 km from industrial installations. The models were adjusted to account for socioeconomic deprivation. We detected a significant, excess risk of dying due to cancer in the following organs (expressed as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals): colon/rectum (1.13; 1.04-1.22 at 4 km), stomach (1.13; 1.00-1.29 at 2 km), liver (1.28; 1.02-1.61 at 1 km), pancreas (1.19; 1.03-1.39 at 2 km), oral and pharyngeal (1.40; 1.08-1.82 at 1 km), oesophagus (2.05; 1.18-3.56 at 500 m) and gallbladder (2.80; 1.14-6.89 at 500 m) for men; and from colorectal (1.21; 1.00-1.46 at 1 km), stomach (1.15; 1.01-1.31 at 4 km) and liver (1.58; 1.20- 2.07 at 1 km) cancers for women. The results support the hypothesis of an association between several digestive cancers and proximity to polluting industrial plants.   Racial/ethnic differences in mortality have not been well studied for either non-cardia gastric cancer (NCGC) or cardia gastric cancer (CGC). The aim of this study was to examine the US mortality rates for these cancer subtypes, as well as esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) as a comparator.\\nWe identified 14\\xa0164 individuals who died from NCGC, 5235 from CGC, and 13\\xa0982 from EAC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2016. Age-adjusted incidence-based mortality rates and corresponding annual percent changes (APCs) were calculated. Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and stage of disease at diagnosis.\\nThe mortality rate in NCGC was two- to threefold higher in blacks, Hispanics, and Asians/Pacific Islanders (PI) than non-Hispanic whites, and was significant across all age groups and stages of disease (P\\xa0<\\xa0.01). Mortality in CGC was higher in non-Hispanic whites than blacks and Asians/PI, particularly in individuals in the 50-64\\xa0year age group and those with stage IV disease. Mortality in EAC was two- to sixfold higher in non-Hispanic whites than all other groups across all age groups and stages of disease. From 2004 to 2016, mortality rates were stable across all racial/ethnic groups in NCGC and CGC, and in minority groups with EAC, but have been rising in non-Hispanic whites with EAC (APC 3.03, 95% CI 0.17-5.96).\\nThis is the largest study of incidence-based mortality in CGC and NCGC and demonstrates racial/ethnic differences in mortality between these subtypes. Mortality rates for NCGC are highest in minority groups, and have been stable in recent years despite declining incidence. Mortality rates for CGC are marginally higher in middle-aged non-Hispanic whites with advanced disease, though have remained stable. In contrast, mortality in EAC has been rising for non-Hispanic whites, in parallel to incidence. Further studies are needed to refine prevention strategies for high-risk individuals dying from these specific cancer subtypes. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, originates from the neuroendocrine system of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. There are limited number of studies investigating neuroendocrine tumors in Turkey.\\nTo define the clinicopathologic, demographic, and survival features of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\\nA retrospective observational cohort study.\\nWe reviewed hospital records of patients and data was analyzed retrospectively. We investigated the clinical, pathological, survival features, and prognosis of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (n=128) admitted to the medical oncology department between year 2003 and 2014. Survival estimation was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were utilized to investigate the prognostic factors for survival.\\nOf 128 patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, 61 (47.7%) were female and 67 (52.3%) were male. The most common site of the tumor was stomach (36.7%), while the most common stage of tumor at diagnosis was stage 4 (40.9%). The median follow-up period was 37 months, while the 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 78% and 69%, respectively. The factors significantly affecting overall survival rate were clinical stage, grade, presence of metastasis at diagnosis, and Ki-67 proliferation index. These factors were associated with the 3- and 5-year overall survival rate. Moreover, grade (hazard ratio: 8.34, 95% confidence interval: 2.16-32.22, p=0.01) and presence of metastasis at diagnosis (hazard ratio: 3.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.30-7.77, p=0.01) independently predicted overall survival in multivariate model following adjustment for age and gender.\\nHigher-grade and presence of metastasis at diagnosis are negative independent prognostic indicators of survival in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Perioperative treatment is an accepted standard approach for treating locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). Histopathological tumor regression with\\u2009<\\u200910% residual tumor is a globally accepted prognosticator in LAGC patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and curative surgery. However, despite a response of the primary tumor, a significant percentage of patients dies from recurrence and identification of those at risk for relapse remains challenging. We re-estimated the value of histopathological tumor regression as a prognosticator alongside other factors, especially posttherapy topographical nodal status, ypN-site.\\nIndividual patient data including clinicopathological variables were used from the four JCOG trials investigating NAC (JCOG0001, JCOG0002, JCOG0210, JCOG0405) for analyzing prognosticators in patients with curative surgery excluding those with type 4 AGC by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses.\\nAmong 85 patients, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 46.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 35.0-56.4] with a median follow-up of 3.2\\xa0years. On univariable analysis, histopathological tumor regression with\\u2009≥\\u200910% residual tumor and ypN-site 2-3 were negatively associated with OS [≥\\u200910% residual tumor: hazard ratio (HR) 2.60; 95% CI 1.22-5.54; P\\u2009=\\u20090.014; ypN2-3: HR 3.59; 95% CI 1.60-8.06; P\\u2009=\\u20090.002). On multivariable analysis, only ypN-site 2-3 was predictive of OS (HR 3.67; 95% CI 1.55-8.69; P\\u2009=\\u20090.003), whereas histopathological tumor regression with\\u2009≥\\u200910% residual tumor was not (HR 2.24; 95% CI 0.98-5.10; P\\u2009=\\u20090.055).\\nypN-site may have greater impact on OS than histopathological tumor regression in patients who received NAC plus surgery for non-type 4 LAGC. The study was designed to investigate the effects and mechanism of a calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) polymorphism at E942K on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected between gastric cancers group and normal controls group by DNA sequence analysis. The cell model was constructed by transfection of E942K mutant plasmid and wild-type (WT) plasmid into SGC-7901 and HEK-293 cells. The effect of E942K mutation on cell proliferation ability was detected by CCK8 and cell clone formation experiments. The effect of E942K mutation on calcium signaling was detected by calcium imaging. Western blot experiments were used to detect changes in phosphorylation levels of key proteins ERK1/2 and β-catenin in downstream signaling pathways after E942K mutation. The results showed that the mutation rate of E942K in gastric cancer group was significantly higher than that in normal control group (P < 0.05). CCK8 and cell clone formation experiments showed that E942K mutation significantly improved the proliferation ability of SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells and HEK-293 cells. E942K mutation enhanced calcium signaling in SGC-7901 and HEK-293 cells. E942K mutation enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation without affecting β-catenin phosphorylation. The results suggest that E942K mutation in CaSR may ultimately promote the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by enhancing intracellular calcium signaling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results have potential clinical implications for the diagnosis and targeted therapy of gastric cancer. The current position of robotic surgery in the field of minimally invasive surgery remains ambiguous. We evaluated long-term trends of robotic general surgery and the future direction of its development.\\nData on robotic cancer surgeries between 2005 and 2014 were retrospectively collected by volunteer institutions in the Republic of Korea. Spearman\\'s correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to compare robotic and laparoscopic surgery trends in general surgery.\\nThe odds that robotic surgery was performed instead of laparoscopic surgery significantly decreased in the fields of colorectal, stomach, and hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-0.97; OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.88-0.92; and OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65-0.78, respectively), except for thyroid surgery (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.25-1.30). Of the total numbers of each procedure, proportions of robotic intersphincteric resections, abdominoperineal resections, and pylorus-preserving surgery performed significantly increased (r\\xa0=\\xa00.98, P\\xa0<\\xa0.001; r\\xa0=\\xa00.78, P\\xa0= .01; and r\\xa0=\\xa00.86, P\\xa0= .007, respectively).\\nThe use of robotic surgery failed to preponderate that of laparoscopic surgery, except for thyroid surgery. Robotic surgery is increasingly preferred for limited fields or complex surgeries, but the use of robotics in simple surgeries has decreased. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential of escalated dose radiation (EDR) robust intensity-modulated proton radiotherapy (ro-IMPT) in reducing GI toxicity risk in locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAUPC) of the head in term of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) predictive model.\\nFor 9 patients, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was compared with ro-IMPT. For all plans, the prescription dose was 59.4GyE (Gray equivalent) in 33 fractions with an equivalent organ at risk (OAR) constraints. Physical dose distribution was evaluated. GI toxicity risk for different endpoints was estimated using published NTCP Lyman Kutcher Burman (LKB) models for stomach, duodenum, small bowel, and combine stomach and duodenum (Stoduo). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for dosimetry parameters and NTCP values comparison.\\nThe dosimetric results have shown that, with similar target coverage, ro-IMPT achieves a significant dose-volume reduction in the stomach, small bowel, and stoduo in low to high dose range in comparison to IMRT. NTCP evaluation for the endpoint gastric bleeding of stomach (10.55% vs. 13.97%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.007), duodenum (1.87% vs. 5.02%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.004), and stoduo (5.67% vs. 7.81%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.008) suggest reduced toxicity by ro-IMPT compared to IMRT. ∆NTCP \\nWith similar target coverage and better conformity, ro-IMPT has the potential to substantially reduce the risk of GI toxicity compared to IMRT in EDR of LAUPC of the head. This result needs to be further evaluated in future clinical studies. Activity of nuclear factor κB transcription factors and signaling via signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) are frequently altered in gastric cancer cells. Mice lacking NFKB1 (Nfkb1\\nWe crossed Nfkb1\\nNfkb1\\nIn studies of gastric tumor development in knockout mice, we found that loss of NFKB1 causes increased expression of TNF in the stomach and thereby drives activation of STAT1, resulting in an inflammatory immune response and the development of gastric cancer. IL11R appears to be required for the progression of gastric tumors to the invasive stage. These findings suggest that inhibitors of TNF, and possibly also inhibitors of IL11/IL11Rα, might be useful in the treatment of gastric cancer. Oesophageal and gastric cancer are highly lethal malignancies with a 5-year survival rate of 15-29%. More knowledge is needed about the quality of end-of-life care in order to understand the burden of the illness and the ability of the current health care system to deliver timely and appropriate end-of-life care. The aim of this study was to describe the impact of initial treatment strategy and survival time on the quality of end-of-life care among patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer.\\nThis register-based cohort study included patients who died from oesophageal and gastric cancer in Sweden during 2014-2016. Through linking data from the National Register for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer, the National Cause of Death Register, and the Swedish Register of Palliative Care, 2156 individuals were included. Associations between initial treatment strategy and survival time and end-of-life care quality indicators were investigated. Adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using modified Poisson regression.\\nPatients with a survival of ≤3 months and 4-7 months had higher RRs for hospital death compared to patients with a survival ≥17 months. Patients with a survival of ≤3 months also had a lower RR for end-of-life information and bereavement support compared to patients with a survival ≥17 months, while the risks of pain assessment and oral assessment were not associated with survival time. Compared to patients with curative treatment, patients with no tumour-directed treatment had a lower RR for pain assessment. No significant differences were shown between the treatment groups regarding hospital death, end-of-life information, oral health assessment, and bereavement support.\\nShort survival time is associated with several indicators of low quality end-of-life care among patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer, suggesting that a proactive palliative care approach is imperative to ensure quality end-of-life care. Paclitaxel (PTX) has become a widely used second-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer. There exists controversy whether targeted therapy combined with PTX can provide additional benefit over PTX alone. Therefore, a meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two therapy regimes.\\nWe searched systematically for studies from the databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library published between January 2000 and August 2019. Only randomized controlled trials were eligible. Statistical analysis was performed by meta-analysis. The primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival, objective response rate and adverse events were the secondary end points.\\nA total of 4 randomized controlled trials with 1574 patients (PTX + targeted therapy, n\\u200a=\\u200a786; PTX, n\\u200a=\\u200a788) were included for the final analysis. As compared with PTX monotherapy, PTX + targeted therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio \\u200a=\\u200a0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.92, P\\u200a<\\u200a.001), overall survival (hazard ratio \\u200a=\\u200a0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.95, P\\u200a<\\u200a.001) and was associated with a better objective response rate (RR\\u200a=\\u200a1.80; 95% CI: 1.45-2.24; P\\u200a<\\u200a.001). PTX+targeted therapy group significantly increased incidences of grade 3 to 5 neutropenia, fatigue and neuropathy (P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in the incidences of grade 3 to 5 anemia, decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhea and abdominal pain between the two treatments (P >.05).\\nSecond-line PTX+targeted therapy is a more effective treatment option with tolerable safety profile for advanced gastric cancer as a result of improved survival, though with additional toxicity. Surgical management of cancer may induce stress and increase the likelihood of cancer metastasis and recurrence. Appropriate surgical and anesthetic techniques may affect the patient\\'s outcome. Although numerous studies have been performed, conflicting results have been obtained regarding the effect of anesthetic techniques on the outcome of patients with cancer. We conducted this study to evaluate the association of anesthetic techniques with overall and recurrence-free survival in patients who had undergone gastric cancer surgery.This retrospective study reviewed the electronic medical records of patients, who had visited our hospital and had been diagnosed with gastric cancer between July 1st, 2006 to June 30th, 2016. Univariate analysis of the potential prognostic factors was performed using the log-rank test for categorical factors, and parameters with a P-value <\\u200a.05 at the univariate step were included in the multivariate regression analysis. Propensity Score Matching was performed to account for differences in baseline characteristics: propofol or desflurane, in a 1:1 ratio.A total of 408 patients anesthetized with desflurane (218) and propofol (190) were eligible for analysis. After propensity matching, 167 patients remained in each group. The overall mortality rate was significantly higher in the desflurane group (56%) than in the propofol group (34%) during follow-up (P <\\u200a.001). In addition, a greater percentage of patients in the desflurane group (41%) exhibited postoperative metastasis than those in the propofol group (19%, P\\u200a<\\u200a.001).The authors found some association between types of anesthesia used and the long-term prognosis of gastric cancer. Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia improved survival and reduced the risk of recurrence and metastasis during the 5-year follow-up period after gastric cancer surgery. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been inconsistently associated with gastric cancer (GC) risk. This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize relevant data on SNPs associated with GC.\\nDatabases were searched to identify association studies of SNPs and GC published through January 2020 from the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and Wan fang databases. Network meta-analysis and Thakkinstian algorithm were used to select the most appropriate genetic model, along with false positive report probability for noteworthy associations. The methodological quality of data was assessed based on the STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association Studies statement Stata 14.0 will be used for systematic review and meta-analysis.\\nThis study will provide a high-quality evidence to find the SNP most associated with GC susceptibility and the best genetic model.\\nThis study will explore which SNP is most associated with GC susceptibility.\\nINPLASY202040132. A robust morphomolecular classification system for gastric carcinoma is required. A 4-tier morphologic classification is proposed, including diffuse, intestinal, tubular, and lymphoid types. A tissue microarray for mismatch repair immunohistochemistry and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in situ hybridization were performed in 329 gastric carcinomas. DNA flow cytometry was used to detect aneuploidy in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Lymphoid histology was the third most common histologic pattern at our institute and strongly associated with EBV infection and PMS2/MLH1-deficiency (both P<0.001). HER2 overexpression and SATB2 expression more frequently occurred in intestinal histology (both P<0.001). Loss of ARID1A expression was strikingly associated with lymphoid histology (P<0.001) and negative E-cadherin expression was correlated with diffuse histology (P=0.001). Programmed death-ligand 1 expression was most frequently present in lymphoid-type gastric carcinoma than other histologic subtypes and correlated with the molecular features of PMS2/MLH1-deficiency and EBV infection (all P<0.001). Aneuploidy was detected in 53% of gastric carcinomas and was highly correlated with intestinal type and the least with the lymphoid type (P<0.001). Notably, lymphoid-type gastric carcinoma showed the best outcome, whereas tubular type showed the worst survival rate (P<0.001). We integrated aneuploidy with morphologic patterns to propose a morphomolecular classification scheme, which served as a successful and independent prognostic factor in multivariate 5-year disease-free survival analysis (P<0.001). Overall, we describe an integrated morphomolecular classification system for gastric carcinomas to effectively predict patient outcomes. This system is cost-effective and reliable and can help select target therapeutics and facilitate clinical management. HpaA as an outer membrane protein of   The molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) are not completely understood. The present study aimed to identify potential novel genes involved in the development and progression of CRC. Database analysis revealed that the mRNA level of the chloride channel accessory 4 (CLCA4) was frequently lower in primary tumor tissues compared with that in corresponding non-cancerous colon tissues, and was even lower in liver metastases than in primary tumors. Further analyses through The Human Protein Atlas (THPA) website and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based tissue microarray (TMA) confirmed that CLCA4 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated in CRC tissues. Furthermore, IHC-based TMA analysis revealed a gradual decrease in CLCA4 protein expression among colorectal normal, adenoma and carcinoma tissues. Survival analysis revealed that the decrease in CLCA4 mRNA expression was associated with the overall survival rate of patients with different types of tumor, including CRC, breast cancer, head and neck cancer and stomach cancer. Overall, downregulated CLCA4 expression may influence the development and progression of CRC. Armed conflicts are increasingly impacting countries with a high burden of cancer. The aim of this study is to systematically review the literature on the impact of armed conflict on cancer in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\\nIn November 2019, we searched five medical databases (Embase, Medline, Global Health, PsychINFO and the Web of Science) without date, language or study design restrictions. We included studies assessing the association between armed conflict and any cancer among civilian populations in LMICs. We systematically re-analysed the data from original studies and assessed quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were analysed descriptively by cancer site.\\nOf 1,543 citations screened, we included 20 studies assessing 8 armed conflicts and 13 site-specific cancers (total study population: 70,172). Two-thirds of the studies were of low methodological quality (score <5) and their findings were often conflicting. However, among outcomes assessed by three or more studies, we found some evidence that armed conflict was associated with increases in the incidence and mortality of non-specific cancers, breast cancer and cervical cancer. Single studies reported a positive association between armed conflict and the incidence of stomach and testicular cancers, some as early as 3 years after the onset of conflict. Some studies reported a post-conflict impact on time to diagnosis.\\nOur findings support the need for more rigorous longitudinal and cohort studies of populations in and immediately post-conflict to inform the development of basic packages of cancer services, and post-conflict cancer control planning and development. None None None None Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are malignant neoplasms of the lymphatic system, typically occurring in the fifth through seventh decades of life. Tumors develop from abnormal lymphocyte proliferation and accumulation. Although a majority of NHLs occur in nodal regions, 40% of cases appear in extranodal sites involving the stomach, spleen, Waldeyer\\'s ring, central nervous system, lung, skin, and bone. Extranodal NHL presents a diagnostic challenge because it may mimic endodontic disease when occurring in intraosseous and soft tissue sites. This case report presents misdiagnosis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the anterior maxilla in a 72-year-old man with a history of Waldenstrom\\'s macroglobulinemia, where the lesion was thought to be associated with a necrotic pulp and a chronic apical abscess on tooth #7. Clinical findings of a facial sinus tract, a nonresponsive pulp, large periapical radiolucency, and history of trauma were in support of this diagnosis for tooth #7. On encountering vital pulpal tissues during cavity access of tooth #7, a cone-beam computed tomography scan and lesion biopsy were obtained. Through immunohistochemistry and histologic analysis, a diagnosis of DLBCL was made. During evaluation of lesions with suspected endodontic etiology, the clinician should consider all factors of the patient\\'s health history, hereditary risk, and comprehensive clinical testing to attain a differential diagnosis. A nonodontogenic etiology of disease should always be considered unless ruled out otherwise. Atypical presentation or testing may prompt the need for biopsy and interspecialty assessment. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a widely accepted treatment option for superficial gastric neoplasia in Asia, but there are few data on outcomes of gastric ESD from North America. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gastric ESD in North America.\\nWe analyzed data from 347 patients who underwent gastric ESD at 25 centers, from 2010 through 2019. We collected data on patient demographics, lesion characteristics, procedure details and related adverse events, treatment outcomes, local recurrence, and vital status at the last follow up. For the 277 patients with available follow-up data, the median interval between initial ESD and last clinical or endoscopic evaluation was 364 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of en bloc and R0 resection. Secondary outcomes included curative resection, rates of adverse events and recurrence, and gastric cancer-related death.\\nNinety patients (26%) had low-grade adenomas or dysplasia, 82 patients (24%) had high-grade dysplasia, 139 patients (40%) had early gastric cancer, and 36 patients (10%) had neuroendocrine tumors. Proportions of en bloc and R0 resection for all lesions were 92%/82%, for early gastric cancers were 94%/75%, for adenomas and low-grade dysplasia were 93%/ 92%, for high-grade dysplasia were 89%/ 87%, and for neuroendocrine tumors were 92%/75%. Intraprocedural perforation occurred in 6.6% of patients; 82% of these were treated successfully with endoscopic therapy. Delayed bleeding occurred in 2.6% of patients. No delayed perforation or procedure-related deaths were observed. There were local recurrences in 3.9% of cases; all occurred after non-curative ESD resection. Metachronous lesions were identified in 14 patients (6.9%). One of 277 patients with clinical follow up died of metachronous gastric cancer that occurred 2.5 years after the initial ESD.\\nESD is a highly effective treatment for superficial gastric neoplasia and should be considered as a viable option for patients in North America. The risk of local recurrence is low and occurs exclusively after non-curative resection. Careful endoscopic surveillance is necessary to identify and treat metachronous lesions. Gastric smooth muscle neoplasms are rare and poorly investigated malignancies. Their importance relies on differential diagnosis with more frequent neoplasms(e.g. GIST), on their often mild and deceitful clinical presentation and on their heterogeneous outcome. Moreover, the pathogenesis of gastric leiomyosarcoma seems to point to some acknowledged oncogenic factors such as radiations or oncogenic viral infections. Herein, we describe a case of metastatic gastric leiomyosarcoma in a young woman, previously diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chemoradiotherapy. Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) has been reported to be an important inflammasome component that exerts tumor suppression in several tumors. However, whether CCL19/CCR7/AIM2 is involved in the progression of GC still remains unclear. Quantitative real-time and ELISA assay were used to determine the expressions of AIM2, CCL19 and CCR7 in GC tissues and cell lines. CCK-8, Edu staining, flow cytometry, Transwell assay, and tumorigenesis in nude mice were used to explore the function of AIM2 and CCL19 in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis and inflammation-related biomarkers were detected by Western blot and ELISA assay. H&E staining was used to assess the histological changes in the subcutaneous tumor model. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to evaluate the expression of Ki-67. We found that expression levels of AIM2, CCL19 and CCR7 were obviously lower in early GC tissues than those in progressive GC tissues. In vitro assays revealed that CCL19 treatment could enhance the suppressive effects of AIM2 overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through CCR7. An in vivo assay also demonstrated that silencing of AIM2 reversed the suppressive effects of CCL19 on tumor growth. Collectively, CCL19 overexpression significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo by up-regulating the CCR7/AIM2 pathway. Thus, CCL19 activated CCR7/AIM2 signaling pathway and it may be a potential therapeutic approach for GC therapy. The immune inflammation-based score is recognized as a prognostic marker for cancer. However, the most accurate prognostic marker for patients with gastric cancer remains undetermined. We aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio for outcomes in gastric cancer patients after radical gastrectomy.\\nA total of 607 gastric cancer patients treated at three Chinese institutions were included. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and the areas under the curve were calculated to compare the predictive value among the inflammation-based score, lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio, C-reactive protein/albumin and neutrophil-lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte and lymphocyte-monocyte ratios. Cox regression was performed to determine the prognostic factors for overall survival.\\nThe median follow-up time was 63\\xa0months (range: 1-84\\xa0months). The optimal cut-off value for lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was 0.63. The patients were divided into the LCR <0.63 (LLCR, n\\xa0=\\xa0294) group and the LCR ≥0.63 (HLCR, n\\xa0=\\xa0313) group. LLCR was significantly correlated with poor clinical characteristics. Compared with inflammation-based score, lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio had the highest areas under the curve (0.695). Patients with LLCR experienced more post-operative complications than the HLCR group (20.4 vs. 12.1%, P\\xa0=\\xa00.006). Multivariate analysis showed that a higher lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (HR: 0.545, 95%CI: 0.372-0.799, P\\xa0=\\xa00.002) was associated with better overall survival. The HLCR group had higher 5-year overall survival rate than the LLCR group (80.5 vs. 54.9%, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001).\\nPreoperative lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio levels can effectively predict the short-term and oncological efficacy of gastric cancer patients after radical gastrectomy with a predictive value significantly better than other inflammation-based score. FAM83H primarily is known for its function in tooth development. Recently, a role for FAM83H in tumorigenesis, conjunction with MYC and β-catenin, has been suggested. Analysis of public data indicates that FAM83H expression is closely associated with SCRIB expression in human gastric cancers. Therefore, this study investigated the roles of FAM83H and SCRIB in 200 human gastric cancers and gastric cancer cells. In human gastric carcinomas, both the individual and combined expression patterns of the nuclear FAM83H and SCRIB were independent indicators of shorter survival of gastric carcinoma patients. In MKN-45 and NCI-N87 gastric cancer cells, the expression of FAM83H and SCRIB were associated with proliferation and invasiveness of cells. FAM83H-mediated  Toona sinensis (TS) is a medicinal herb possessing anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties and is used to treat diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. In traditional Chinese medicine theory, TS clears dampness and heat, strengthens the stomach function, and regulates vital energy flow. TS is also used as an astringent and a pesticide. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how TS influences autophagy and cytokines during the inflammatory process in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The treatment groups were pre-supplemented with TS leaf extract; rapamycin was used to enhance autophagy and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammation. The expression of autophagy-related proteins was analyzed by western blotting. The survival rate of, and chemokine expression and oxidative stress in the cells were also assessed. TS leaf extract inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation at site S2448 in the macrophages. At relatively higher concentrations (50 and 75\\u202fμg/mL), TS elevated the expression of light chain 3 II (LC3-II), which further modulated autophagy. Pre-supplementation with TS leaf extract elevated the total glutathione (GSH) level and GSH/oxidized GSH (GSSG) ratio, but it decreased the GSSG, total nitric oxide, nitrate, nitrite, malondialdehyde, and superoxide anion levels. TS reversed the effects of LPS-induced cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10. TS did not induce significant toxicity at the studied concentrations. In conclusion, TS leaf extract may modulate autophagy during inflammation. Furthermore, it may prevent cell damage via anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. Thus, this study supports the ethnomedical use of TS in the prevention of inflammation-related diseases. The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the epidemiology of liver metastases at the time of primary cancer diagnosis (synchronous liver metastases), (2) characterize the incidence trends of synchronous liver metastases from 2010-2015 and (3) assess survival of patients with synchronous liver metastases.\\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015 was queried to obtain cases of patients with liver metastases at the time of primary cancer diagnosis. The primary cancers with an incidence rate of liver metastasis >0.1 are presented in this analysis.\\nAmong 2.4 million cancer patients, 5.14 % of cancer patients presented with synchronous liver metastases. The most common primary site was breast cancers for younger women (ages 20-50), and colorectal cancers for younger men. As patients get older, a more heterogenous population of the top cancers with liver metastases emerges including esophageal, stomach, small intestine, melanoma, and bladder cancer in addition to the large proportion of lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. The 1-year survival of all patients with liver metastases was 15.1 %, compared to 24.0 % in those with non-hepatic metastases. Regression analysis showed that the presence of liver metastasis was associated with reduced survival, particularly in patients with cancers of the testis, prostate, breast, and anus, and in those with melanoma.\\nThe most common primary sites for patients with liver metastases varied based on age at diagnosis. Survival for patients with liver metastasis was significantly decreased as compared to patients without liver metastasis. Stroke is associated with a higher risk of occult cancer. We studied the types of occult cancer most often associated with stroke.\\nAll patients with incident stroke in Denmark 2003-2015 were identified through the Danish Stroke Registry (n\\xa0=\\xa085\\xa0893) and matched 1:10 on age and sex to the Danish background population without history of stroke (n\\xa0=\\xa0858\\xa0740). Linking data to the Danish Cancer Registry, we determined the prevalence of occult cancer in stroke defined as the event of previously unknown cancer during a one-year follow-up in the stroke and the background population. We stratified cancers into the 15 most common cancers and into cancers related to and not related to smoking.\\nPrevalence (per 1000 person-years; stroke/background population) of smoking-related occult cancers (lung, colon, bladder rectum, pancreas, kidney, stomach, and head and neck) was 13.3/8.1 (P\\xa0<\\xa0.01) and of cancers not related to smoking (prostate, breast, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, endometrial) it was 6.6/6.2 (P\\xa0>\\xa0.05). Among men with stroke prostate (5.8), lung (5.7), and colon cancers (2.9) were most frequent; among women, it was lung (4.7), breast(3.5), and colon cancer(2.8). Among men in the background population, prostate(5.4), lung (3.0), and colon cancers (2.1) were most frequent. Among women, it was breast (3.7), lung(2.1), and colon cancers (1.9).\\nStroke patients\\' increased risk of occult cancer was predominantly for smoking-related cancers while there was no higher risk for the most frequent cancers unrelated to smoking, that is, prostate and breast cancers. Lung cancer is the dominant type of occult cancer in stroke. The study aim is to analyze the evolution over the last 25 years of the results reported after abdominal oncological surgery in patients aged 80 years of age and older. The primary endpoint was morbidity and mortality in this group of patients; the secondary endpoint was overall survival.\\nA systematic search strategy was used to browse through Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a combination of standardized index terms. Studies published between 1997 and 2017 were selected. Only those studies that showed morbidity and mortality after digestive and hepatobiliary tract oncological surgery in individuals aged 80 years and older were included. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42018087921. PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were applied.\\nA total of 79 studies were included, categorized by origin of malignancy: esophageal (7), stomach (26), liver (4), pancreas (19), and colorectal (23). Compared with the non-elderly group, the elderly group had similar esophageal morbidity with higher mortality (RR 2.51, 1.50 to 4.21; P\\xa0=\\xa00.0005); higher gastric morbidity (RR 1.25, 1.09 to 1.43; P\\xa0=\\xa00.001), and mortality (RR 2.51, 1.81 to 3.49; P\\xa0=\\xa00.0001); similar liver morbidity and mortality; higher pancreatic morbidity (RR 1.17, 1.03 to 1.33; P\\xa0=\\xa00.02) and mortality (RR 2.37, 1.86 to 3.03; P\\xa0<\\xa00.00001); and similar colorectal morbidity with higher mortality (RR 4.44, 1.91 to 10.32; P\\xa0=\\xa00.005).\\nOncological surgery of most abdominal visceral tumors is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients older than 80 years.  The aim of the present review was to assess the role of combined \\nWe have searched MEDLINE databases, including PubMed and Scopus, for studies about the combined FDG and Ga-68 DOTA-peptides PET-CT or PET/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in NETs in the last 15\\xa0years (from 2004 to November 2019). No limits were applied to the search strategy. Abstracts, reviews, letters to editors, and editorials were excluded.\\nSeven studies met the inclusion criteria. In total 236 patients received both \\nGa-68 DOTA-peptides and F-18 FDG PET should be considered complementary in patients with NETs. They should be both performed in the initial staging and during follow-up, with a specific selection of patients and in a multidisciplinary vision. As one of the leading cancer-related mortalities worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) shows resistance to chemotherapy mainly because of drug resistance. Existing evidence has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance scenarios. However, the mechanism by which lncRNA induces chemoresistance and the postoperative prognosis of CRC both remain unclear.\\nThe expression of a lncRNA named lncARSR in CRC tissue was tested, and its association with clinical and pathological features was analyzed. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays were conducted to investigate the role of lncARSR in vivo and in vitro.\\nFunctional analysis showed that overexpressing lncARSR increased oxaliplatin (OXA) resistance of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, lncARSR conferred chemoresistance to CRC cells. Silencing lncARSR decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis after OXA treatment, whereas overexpression of lncARSR increased cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis after OXA treatment. In addition, lncARSR overexpression induced the tumor formation capacity of colorectal cancer cells.\\nThe results obtained in the present study show that up-regulation of lncARSR promoted OXA resistance in CRC. Our results also imply that lncARSR may be a candidate marker for CRC chemoresistance. A 69-year-old woman who had a history of chronic hepatitis C, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome was treated with sorafenib at a daily dose of 400\\xa0mg for HCC with multiple lung metastases. Nonetheless, elevated serum tumor markers further increased (alpha fetoprotein from 121,100 to 348,660\\xa0ng/ml and protein induced by vitamin K absence/antagonist-II from 3435 to 29,357 mAU/ml), and lung metastatic lesions on chest X-ray showed no improvement after 2\\xa0months of sorafenib treatment. Sorafenib was discontinued because of adverse events with diarrhea, fatigue, and severe anemia due to bleeding from stomach telangiectasia. Hand-foot syndrome was mild. Thereafter, the tumor markers rapidly decreased to almost normal range, and the lung and liver tumors markedly shrunk and disappeared without any other cancer treatments. Her tumors remained in complete remission for 17\\xa0months until an intrahepatic recurrence occurred. This unique course of metastatic HCC indicated that antitumor mechanisms other than the direct anticancer effect of sorafenib contributed to tumor shrinkage. This study aimed to determine whether postoperative chemotherapy is associated with a survival benefit for patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) of the stomach, small bowel, or pancreas.\\nPatients were identified in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) between 2004 and 2014. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to reduce selection bias. To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients in different treatment groups, IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used.\\nThe inclusion criteria were met by 759 patients. The diagnosis was NEC of the stomach for 195 patients (25.7%), NEC of the small intestine for 278 patients (36.6%), and NEC of the pancreas for 286 patients (37.7%). Overall, 213 patients (28.1%) received postoperative chemotherapy after curative resection. For the patients who received chemotherapy, IPTW-adjusted survival showed no OS benefit. However, subgroup analysis demonstrated improved OS with observation (OB) for patients with NEC of the small intestine (hazard ratio [HR], 1.436; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.823; P\\u2009=\\u20090.003), T3 or T4 primary tumor (HR, 1.258; 95% CI 1.08-1.465; P\\u2009=\\u20090.003), node-positive disease (HR, 1.238; 95% CI 1.040-1.475; P\\u2009=\\u20090.0165), or positive resection margin (HR, 1.4283; 95% CI 1.02-2.00; P\\u2009=\\u20090.038).\\nIn this national database analysis, postoperative chemotherapy was not associated with improved survival for patients with poorly differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NECs. These findings highlight the need for continued efforts to understand better which patients in this high-risk population will benefit from additional systemic therapy and the need for continued development of more effective therapies for these patients. The traditional Billroth II and Roux-en-Y anastomosis after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer are associated with bile reflux gastritis and roux stasis syndrome, respectively. The uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy can decrease the incidence of these complications by blocking the entry of bile and pancreatic juice into the residual stomach and retaining the impulses originating from the duodenum. The purpose of the present study was to compare the short-term outcomes of uncut Roux-en-Y (URY) and Billroth II combined Braun (BB) anastomosis.\\nIn this prospective, multi-center, two-arm randomized controlled trial, 124 patients with advanced distal gastric cancer were randomized into two groups: URY (n\\u2009=\\u200962) and BB (n\\u2009=\\u200962) groups.\\nThe mean gastric juice pH was significantly lower in the URY group compared with the BB group (3.94\\u2009±\\u20090.71 vs. 5.83\\u2009±\\u20090.91, P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). The bile reflux gastritis at 3\\xa0months (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) and 6\\xa0months (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002) was significantly more frequent in the BB group. No recanalization occurred in the URY group, and no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of mean operative time (P\\u2009=\\u20090.69), mean time to perform anastomosis (P\\u2009=\\u20090.86), mean estimated blood loss (P\\u2009=\\u20090.77), mean number of harvested lymph nodes (P\\u2009=\\u20090.90), time to first passage of flatus or defecation (P\\u2009=\\u20090.87), postoperative hospital stay (P\\u2009=\\u20090.83), and the incidence of postoperative complications (P\\u2009=\\u20090.70).\\nURY anastomosis is associated with a significantly lower incidence of bile reflux gastritis and roux stasis syndrome compared with BB anastomosis. Current national guidelines do not include hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) as treatment for gastric cancer, and there are no completed clinical trials of cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and HIPEC from the US.\\nPatients with gastric adenocarcinoma and positive peritoneal cytology or carcinomatosis who had completed systemic chemotherapy and laparoscopic HIPEC underwent cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and HIPEC with 30\\xa0mg mitomycin C and 200\\xa0mg cisplatin. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), with a secondary endpoint of postoperative complications (NCT02891447).\\nWe enrolled 20 patients from September 2016 to March 2019. Six patients had positive cytology only and 14 had carcinomatosis. All patients were treated with systemic chemotherapy with a median of eight cycles (range 5-11 cycles) and at least one laparoscopic HIPEC. The median peritoneal carcinomatosis index at cytoreduction/gastrectomy/HIPEC was 2 (range 0-13). After surgery, the 90-day morbidity and mortality rates were 70% and 0%, respectively. Median length of hospital stay was 13\\xa0days (range 7-23\\xa0days); median follow-up was 33.5\\xa0months; median OS from the date of diagnosis of metastatic disease was 24.2\\xa0months; and median OS from the date of cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and HIPEC was 16.1\\xa0months. 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates from the diagnosis of metastatic disease were 90%, 50%, and 28%, respectively.\\nSurvival rates for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and peritoneal disease treated with cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and HIPEC are encouraging; our early results are similar to those of recent prospective registry studies. Multi-institutional and cooperative group trials should be supported to confirm survival and safety outcomes. Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is defined as pancreatic tissue in organs with no anatomical continuity with the orthotopic pancreas. Based on the number of cases reported in the literature between the year 2000 and 2020, HP is rarely found causing malignant transformation of the duodenum. We herein report a case of adenocarcinoma arising from the HP in the first portion of the duodenum.\\nA 77-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital with epigastric pain. Despite having undergone laparoscopic surgery for early sigmoid colon cancer a month earlier, serum levels of tumor-specific antigens, such as CA19-9, were elevated. After undergoing a series of radiologic examinations, the first portion of the duodenum was found thickened. However, a biopsy of the lesion showed no malignancy. Four months later, follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans showed that the lesion was thicker and involved the gastroduodenal artery (GDA), suggesting tumor invasion. A new biopsy did not detect the malignancy. However, serum tumor-specific antigen levels increased, especially duke pancreatic monoclonal antigen type 2 (5287\\u2009U/mL), in the absence of tumor in the orthotopic pancreas. The follow-up CT imaging showed a malignant tumor in the first portion of the duodenum. Five months later, we performed a subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSPPD) for duodenal or HP cancer in the first portion of the duodenum, finding a lesion from the pyloric bulbs to the first portion of the duodenum, which invaded the adjacent pancreas and GDA. The pathological examination of the specimens revealed adenocarcinoma arising from HP. Nine months after surgery, no recurrence was found by radiologic imaging or tumor-specific antigen laboratory testing.\\nHP adenocarcinoma is rare and difficult to diagnose preoperatively due to its submucosal location. Therefore, a careful follow-up with blood testing and radiologic imaging, as well as diagnostic surgery, is recommended. None Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts and are the major stromal component in various types of malignancies. CAFs often undergo metabolic reprogramming to create an appropriate microenvironment for cancer progression. However, it remains unclear whether the metastatic properties of cancer cells affect aerobic glycolysis in stromal cells. Here, we show that gastric cancer (GC) cells with high metastatic potential strongly promote the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in fibroblasts. Transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of glycolysis-related genes, such as LDHA and ENO2, significantly changed in fibroblasts when they were cocultured with cancer cells with high metastatic potential compared to fibroblasts incubated with cancer cells with low metastatic potential. Glucose uptake, lactate production and oxygen consumption in fibroblasts were changed by coculture with GC cells with high metastatic potential. Thus, metabolic reprogramming in CAFs may reflect the metastatic properties of GC cells. Monomorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders have been defined as lymphoid or plasmacytic proliferations that fulfill criteria for one of the B-cell or T/NK-cell neoplasms recognized in immunocompetent hosts in the current WHO Classification. Low-grade B-cell neoplasms have historically been excluded from this category, although rare reports of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) have been described. We report 9 cases of posttransplant Epstein-Barr virus-negative MZL, all arising in solid organ transplant recipients (4 renal, 3 liver, 1 cardiac, and 1 liver, pancreas, and small bowel). Seven were extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, all of which had gastrointestinal involvement (4 colon, 1 duodenum, 1 stomach, and 1 oropharynx/base of tongue). Notably, the preferential involvement of intestine distinguishes posttransplant extranodal MZL from sporadic cases. Immunoglobulin light-chain restriction was seen in all cases, with polymerase chain reaction showing a monoclonal pattern in 7 of 8 cases with successful amplification of polymerase chain reaction products. A clonally unrelated recurrence was seen in one case. Next-generation sequencing identified recurrent mutations previously reported in MZL in 3/5 cases. MZL was diagnosed at least 1 year after solid organ transplant (median time to presentation, 84\\u2009mo; range, 13 to 108\\u2009mo). The median age was 44 (range, 9 to 73\\u2009y); the male: female ratio was 5:4. The mean follow-up was 33.4 months, with an indolent clinical course observed. A subset responded to reduction in immunosuppression and anti-CD20 therapy alone. These data support the designation of Epstein-Barr virus-negative MZL as an uncommon form of monomorphic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders. We examine recent trends in the major cancers occurring in the Golestan province, a high-risk region for upper gastrointestinal cancers in Northern Iran, and provide short-term cancer predictions of the future cancer burden.\\nNew cancer cases diagnosed in Golestan 2004-2016 were obtained from the Golestan population-based cancer registry (GPCR) database, and age-standardized rates by cancer site, year and sex calculated per 100,000 person-years. Using IARC\\'s DepPred package we fitted time-linear age-period models to the available GPCR data to predict the cancer incidence burden in the year 2025. We calculated the contribution of demographic changes versus changes in risk to the overall changes in incidence from 2016 to 2025.\\nThe number of new cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) in 2025 is predicted to increase by 61.3% from 2678 cases in 2016 to 4319 cases. While a 17.6% reduction in the number of esophageal cancer cases is predicted by 2025, the number of new cases for each of the remaining major cancers is predicted to increase over the next decade, including cancers of the stomach (a 36.1% increase from 2016 to 2025), colorectum (56.2%), lung (67.8%), female breast (93.2%), prostate (101.8%) and leukemia (96.1%). The changes in the population structure and risk contributed 37.8% and 23.5% respectively, to the overall increase in incidence.\\nOther than for the major upper gastrointestinal cancer types, the incidence rates of common cancers observed in the province are on the rise, reinforcing the need for continuous surveillance, as well as the design and implementation of effective cancer control programs. Monitoring regional variation in population-based cancer survival is useful for assessing equity in national health-care system. This study quantifies variation in survival between municipalities and hospital districts responsible for primary care and for specialised care, respectively, in Finland.\\nFive-year relative survival of 11 cancers and close to 700,000 patients was estimated by municipality in Finland over 1962-2016 using hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Variation (i) between hospital districts, (ii) between municipalities within hospital districts, and (iii) between all municipalities (total variation) were quantified by the standard deviation of 5-year relative survival standardised by the average survival level.\\nIn 2007-2016, the largest variation in 5-year relative survival between all municipalities was in stomach, prostate, kidney and liver cancer and skin melanoma. In male skin melanoma, prostate, and kidney cancer and in male and female pancreatic cancer, there was substantial and statistically significant variation between hospital districts, too. Variation within hospital districts was on average 67% (95% posterior interval [58%,76%]) out of the total variation and had decreased by 18% [2%, 33%] from 1997-2006.\\nThe decrease in variation within hospital districts suggests that equity in diagnostics and primary care has improved in Finland. However, the variation between hospital districts in skin melanoma, prostate and kidney cancer reflects differences in early diagnostics. In pancreatic cancer, substantial variation between hospital districts may relate to regional differences in the accessibility and the quality of cancer treatments. Formin-like genes (FMNLs) are members of formins family and have been implicated to the development and progression of multiple cancers. This research aims to analyze the expression profiles, prognostic values, and immune infiltrating associations of FMNLs in gastric cancer (GC) using multiple online bioinformatics website, including Oncomine, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, TIMER, GeneMANIA, DAVID, and LinkedOmics databases. The mRNA levels of FMNL1/2/3 were higher in GC tissues than normal. Meanwhile, FMNLs expressions tend to be upregulated in advanced and poorly differentiated GC. Prognostic value analysis suggested that high transcription levels of FMNL1/3 were associated with poor overall survival in GC patients. Correlation analysis between FMNLs expressions and immune infiltrating GC revealed that the expressions of FMNLs were significantly associated with immune infiltrating. Protein-protein interaction network and enrichment analysis of FMNLs in GC showed that FMNLs coexpressed genes mainly participated in organizing actin cytoskeleton through affecting small G proteins activity. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis uncovered FMNLs and their coexpressed genes was tightly associated with immune-related cellular functions. These findings demonstrate that FMNLs might play significant immunomodulatory roles in tumor immunity and could be novel therapeutic targets and potential prognostic biomarkers in GC. Esophageal cancer patients sometimes have a history of previous gastrectomy. To determine whether we should resect or preserve the remnant stomach, we need to understand the frequency and sites of abdominal lymph node (LN) metastasis from esophageal cancer after gastrectomy.\\nIn 46 patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who had a history of previous gastrectomy due to gastric cancer (n\\u2009=\\u200920) or benign disease (n\\u2009=\\u200926), the frequency and sites of any LN metastasis including LN metastasis at surgery and LN recurrence were investigated. The factors associated with abdominal LN metastasis were also examined.\\nThe incidence of metastasis to cervical, mediastinal, and abdominal LNs at surgery was 10.8%, 30.4%, and 30.4%, respectively. The incidence of abdominal LN recurrence was 6.5%. Of 46 patients, 16 patients (34.8%) had any abdominal LN metastasis, including abdominal LN metastasis at surgery or abdominal LN recurrence. There was no significant difference in the incidence of any abdominal LN metastasis between the gastric cancer group and the benign disease group (25.0% vs. 42.3%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.222). Clinically, nodal status was identified as the only independent factor associated with the occurrence of any abdominal LN metastasis, although neither tumor location nor the reason for gastrectomy was.\\nThe present study showed that the incidence of abdominal LN metastasis from ESCC after gastrectomy was not necessarily low, regardless of the tumor location and the reason for previous gastrectomy. This result suggests that gastrectomy should not be omitted easily in ESCC patients after previous gastrectomy. Albeit early stage gastrointestinal (GI) carcinomas have a good prognosis if treated with surgery, diagnosis is often confirmed at a late stage and efficacious drugs are lacking. Recent progress in immune-based therapies has focused on dendritic cells (DCs), aiming to elicit tumor-specific responses by inducing immunological memory. Our previous microarray study indicated that a biomarker, termed lymphocyte antigen-6E (LY6E), is commonly overexpressed in two potentially lethal GI cancers: those of colon and stomach. In this study, we examined the antigenic potency of LY6E in stimulating DCs.\\nFollowing isolation, differentiation, and maturation of mononuclear cells, DCs were pulsed with LY6E peptide, a protein related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/II. Subsequently, DCs were co-cultured with mouse splenocytes to assess antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. Elucidated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses were assessed using subcutaneous colorectal murine tumor models.\\nOur in vitro results suggest that DCs loaded with LY6E peptide antigen are capable of stimulating and inducing proliferation of murine T-cells. Furthermore, our in vivo results demonstrate that LY6E peptide has a substantial impact on provoking immune responses against induced colon cancer in mice.\\nIn conclusion, based on the overexpression of LY6E in colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers, the role of this peptide should be further investigated with a goal of developing new therapies for these challenging diseases. Scrape cellblock (SCB) is a novel technique to suggest possible primary site in fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears from the liver, lung, and lymph nodes which are the common sites of metastasis of many primary tumors. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) on SCB averts the need of more invasive diagnostic procedures and gives a conclusive diagnosis. We present a series of four cases with unknown primary site, in which ICC was done on SCB to suggest possible primary site. Three of them were liver space-occupying lesions (SOL) and one from the periportal lymph node. In all four cases, wet-fixed smear for hematoxylin and eosin stain was prepared as routine procedure. FNAC was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma in two and metastatic spindle cell neoplasm in one liver SOL. Periportal node was reported metastatic adenocarcinoma. Two hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from each case with higher cellularity were used to scrape off the material to prepare SCB. ICC was put which gave conclusive diagnosis in all the cases. On ICC, two cases of metastatic carcinoma in the liver were diagnosed as metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm from Gastrointestinal Tract and metastatic adenocarcinoma from the stomach. Spindle cell neoplasm of the liver was diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor from the stomach. Pancreatic head mass in metastatic periportal node was confirmed later by radiologic examination. SCB is a useful technique to make the best use of available material where reaspiration is difficult. ICC on SCB is of maximum utility to suggest possible primary sites in metastatic cases with unknown primary or where biopsy of the lesion is not possible. Apatinib showed promising efficacy in the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (mGC) in previous clinical studies. However, the real-world data are limited, and this study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of apatinib for the treatment of advanced or mGC in this setting.\\nIn this prospective observational study, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were recorded and evaluated. \\ufeffUnivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore potential biomarkers which might be related to the effectiveness.\\nA \\ufefftotal of 321 mGC patients from 47 centers in China were enrolled between July 1, 2015, and March 1, 2018. Thirty-two patients achieved partial response, 155 patients achieved stable disease, and 115 patients had progressive disease, and no CR was achieved, illustrating an ORR of 10.60% and a DCR of 61.92%. The median PFS and OS were 4.0 and 8.2 months, respectively. Multivariate \\ufeffCox analysis showed that the potential biomarkers associated with longer PFS were combination regimens plus taxel/docetaxel, and apatinib initial dosage ≥500mg, occurrence of AEs of leukopenia, and hand\\ufeff-foot syndrome. Main AEs were proteinuria (17.1%), hypertension (15.9%), and handfoot syndrome (8.7%).\\nThe present prospective observational study showed favorable effectiveness and safety of apatinib in real\\ufeff-world patients with advanced or metastatic GC in China. (A prospective, multi-center, non-intervention study of \\ufeffapatinib in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer-Trial Registry Number: ChiCTR-OPN-15006601). The exhaustion and poor homing of activated lymphocytes are critical obstacles in adoptive cell immunotherapy for solid tumors. In order to effectively deliver immune cells into tumors, we encapsulated interferon-α2b (IFN-α2b) into macroporous hydrogels as an enhancement factor and utilized low-dose irradiation (LDI) as a tumoral attractor of T cells.\\nHydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels were prepared by irradiation techniques, and the cross-sectional microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The synergistic antitumor mechanism of combination of IFN-α2b and CIK cells was evaluated by detecting the expression of activation marker CD69 on CIK cell surface and IFN-γ production by CIK cells. The in vivo antitumor activity of IFN-α2b-incorporated hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels combined with CIK and radiation was evaluated in an MKN-45 xenografted nude mice model.\\nThe bioactivity of IFN-α2b was well maintained in ultraviolet-reactive, rapidly cross-linkable hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels. In vitro studies demonstrated IFN-α2b-activated T cells, as evidenced by upregulating early activation marker CD69 and secretion inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. In vivo real-time image showed our hydrogels kept a higher amount of drug delivery at the tumor site for a long time compared with free drug injection. Low-dose irradiation promoted T cell accumulation and infiltration in subcutaneous tumors. Combination of IFN-α2b-loaded hydrogels (Gel-IFN) with T cells and LDI exhibited higher efficacy to eradicate human gastric cancer xenograted tumors with less proliferating cells and more necrotic regions compared with IFN-α2b or T cells alone.\\nHPC hydrogels kept the activity of IFN-α2b and stably release of IFN-α2b to stimulate T cells for a long time. At the same time, low-dose radiation recruits T cells into tumors. This innovative integration mode of IFN-α2b-loaded hydrogels and radiotherapy offers a potent strategy to improve the therapeutic outcome of T cell therapy. Evaluate the feasibility of fluorine-18 (\\nThe PET/CT and PET/MR imaging were sequentially performed in 30 patients with gastric cancer diagnosed by gastroscope using a single-injection-with-dual-imaging protocol. After intravenous injection of \\nThe image quality and lesion conspicuity of the T2W-HASTE images were significantly improved compared to that of the T2W-BLADE images. A significantly higher number of artifacts were seen in the T2W-HASTE images compared with the T1W and CT images (p\\u2009<\\u20090. 05). No differences in the accuracy of image fusion between PET/MR and PET/CT (p\\u2009>\\u20090. 05); however, significant difference was seen in the lesion conspicuity measurements (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) with T2W-HASTE being superior. For information about the primary lesion characteristics, the T2W-HASTE images provided the most successful identifications compared with those of the T1W and PET/CT (13vs7vs5) images.\\nPET/MR with the T2W-HASTE was better at revealing the details of local stomach lesions compared with PET/CT imaging. Combining the PET/MR with the T2W-HASTE technique is a promising imaging method for diagnosing and staging gastric cancer. Signet ring cell adenocarcinomas (SRCCs) are a rare histological subtype of adenocarcinomas with a poor prognosis, typically due to advanced disease at diagnosis. A signet ring cell, mimicking its moniker, contains abundant intracytoplasmic mucin that pushes the nucleus to the periphery. In these cancers, this cell feature comprises more than 50% of the tumor. Despite predilection for the gastrointestinal tract, and in particular the stomach, primary SRCCs are also described in other sites, typically in case reports. This literature, however, lacks a standardized overview of the SRCC disease entity. Using a retrospective cohort approach, we summarize the clinicodemographic and mortality outcomes of SRCCs in thirteen primary sites, comprising 95% of all SRCCs in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER), a population-level cancer database covering nearly one-third of the United States population. SRCCs general trends compared to matching nonvariant adenocarcinomas are earlier age of onset, with initial presentation favoring higher rates of regional or distant disease presentation and poor tumor differentiation. After multivariable analysis, SRCCs typically have worse overall survivals, but substantial variances exist depending on tumor location. Identifying SRCCs at earlier disease stages is likely the single most important intervention to improving outcomes for these patients. Older patients (65 years and over) represent the majority of patients with a cancer diagnosis. For oesophageal carcinomas, the age peak is in the seventh to eighth decade of life. In gastric carcinoma, 1/3 of patients are older than 75 years and approximately 45\\u200a% of colon carcinoma patients are ≥\\u200a75\\xa0years old.Due to existing comorbidities, age-related changes and polypharmacy, older patients present a special challenge in tumor therapy.In studies, these patients are usually clearly under-represented and \"elderly\"-studies are rare.New surgical procedures with laparoscopy and also robotic provide advantages for esophageal and gastric carcinoma, which in the future can reduce postoperative morbidity in relation to cardiac and pulmonary complications for old and older patients. The selection of suitable patients is essential here.With regard to chemotherapy, fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin are well tolerated; triplet therapies should be avoided. Immunotherapy in particular offers an interesting alternative to standard chemotherapy due to its better side effect profile.\\nÄltere Patienten (65 Jahre und älter) stellen die Mehrheit der Patienten mit einer Krebsdiagnose dar. Für Ösophaguskarzinome liegt der Altersgipfel in der siebten bis achten Lebensdekade. Bei Magenkarzinomen ist 1/3 der Patienten älter als 75 Jahre, und ca. 45\\u200a% der Kolonkarzinom-Patienten sind ≥\\u200a75\\xa0Jahre alt.Aufgrund bestehender Komorbiditäten, altersbedingter Veränderungen und Polypharmazie stellen ältere und alte Patienten eine besondere Herausforderung in der Tumortherapie dar.In Studien sind diese Patienten meist deutlich unterrepräsentiert, und dezidierte „Elderly“-Studien sind rar. Neue Operationsverfahren mit der minimalinvasiven Technik wie der Laparoskopie oder mit Telemanipulatoren liefern gerade für das Ösophagus- und Magenkarzinom Vorteile, die zukünftig für alte und ältere Patienten die postoperative Morbidität in Bezug auf kardiale und pulmonale Komplikationen deutlich senken können.Bezüglich Chemotherapie zeigt sich eine gute Verträglichkeit von Fluoropyrimidinen und Oxaliplatin; von Triple-Therapien sollte eher Abstand genommen werden. Gerade die Immuntherapie bietet aufgrund des besseren Nebenwirkungsprofils eine interessante Alternative zur Standardchemotherapie. Differences in registration practices across population-based cancer registries may contribute to international variation in survival estimates. In particular, there are variations in recorded date of incidence (DOI) as cancer registries have access to different sources of information and use different rules to determine an official DOI. This study investigates the impact of different DOI rules on cancer survival estimates.\\nDetailed data on dates of pathological confirmation and hospital admittance were collected from three registries participating in the ICBP SURVMARK-2 project (England, Northern Ireland and Norway). Multiple dates of incidence were determined for each cancer patient diagnosed during 2010-2014 by applying three sets of rules that prioritize either: a) histological date, b) hospital admittance date or c) the earliest date recorded. For each set of rules and registry, 1- and 5-year net survival were estimated for eight cancer sites (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, lung and ovary).\\nThe mean difference between different DOIs within a country and cancer site ranged from 0.1-23 days. The variation in 1- and 5-year net survival using different DOIs were generally small for all registries and cancer sites. Only for liver and pancreatic cancer in Norway and ovarian cancer in England, were larger 1-year survival differences, of 2-3 % found.\\nIn the ongoing discussion of the comparability of survival estimates across registry populations, the use of different DOI definitions can be considered to have a very limited impact. Most patients with gastric cancer (GC) are first diagnosed at stage III-IV and surgery resection remains the primary therapeutic modality for these patients. However, clinical staging used for prediction of those patients provides limited information. We collected clinicopathological data and disease-progression information from 508 patients with stage III-IV GC at three Chinese hospitals and 1298 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Based on the stepwise multivariate regression model, we constructed a novel nomogram to predict overall survival (OS). The performance of discrimination for this model was measured using Harrell\\'s concordance index (C-index) and receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC), and was validated using calibration plots. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that tumor size, age at diagnosis, N stage, tumor grade, and distant metastases were outstanding independent prognostic factors of stage III-IV GC. We developed a nomogram based on these five prognostic predictors. In the training set, the C-index of the nomogram was 0.645 (95% CI: 0.611-0.679), which was higher than that of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM system alone (sixth TNM: 0.544; seventh TNM: 0.575; eighth TNM: 0.568). Similar results were observed in validation cohort. Moreover, calibration blots demonstrated good consistency between the actual and predicted OS probabilities. According to the nomogram, GC individuals could be classified into three groups (low-, middle-, and high-risk) (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001). Our nomogram complements the current staging system for prediction of individual prognosis with stage III-IV GC, and may be helpful for making individualized treatment decisions. Skip lymphatic metastasis (SK) is an exceptional and characteristic pattern of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer (GC) with infrequent incidence. This is an extremely rare report of occult gastric cancer with solitary skip lymphatic metastasis as the initial and primary observation.\\nA 61-year-old woman, who complained of epigastric discomfort for several years, presented a solitary nodule upon pancreas neck examination by CT without performance on the primary lesion, even gastroscopy. During the preoperative 4-month follow-up, the nodule stayed stable without any therapy. The postoperative pathological examination confirmed the consistent diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma between the nodule and the stomach lesion, which was found by preoperative random biopsy of the mucosa.\\nThis case highlights the concentration on vigilance to the SK of GC and a closer observation for intra-abdominal nodules, even radiological suspicion of a benign lesion. Classical microRNA (miRNA) has been so far believed as a single sequence, but it indeed contains multiple miRNA isoforms (isomiR) with various sequences and expression patterns. It is not clear whether these diverse isomiRs have potential relationships and whether they contribute to miRNA:mRNA interactions. Here, we aimed to reveal the potential evolutionary and functional relationships of multiple isomiRs based on let-7 and miR-10 gene families that are prone to clustering together on chromosomes. Multiple isomiRs within gene families showed similar functions to their canonical miRNAs, indicating selection of the predominant sequence. IsomiRs containing novel seed regions showed increased/decreased biological function depending on whether they had more/less specific target mRNAs than their annotated seed. Few gene ontology(GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were shared among the target genes of the annotated seeds and the novel seeds. Various let-7 isomiRs with novel seed regions may cause opposing drug responses despite the fact that they are generated from the same miRNA locus and have highly similar sequences. IsomiRs, especially the dominant isomiRs with shifted seeds, may disturb the coding-non-coding RNA regulatory network. These findings provide insight into the multiple isomiRs and isomiR-mediated control of gene expression in the pathogenesis of cancer. Clinical-trial design, analysis, and interpretation entails the use of efficient and reliable endpoints. Statistical issues related to endpoints warrant continued attention, as they may have a substantial impact on the conduct of clinical trials and on interpretation of their results.\\nWe review concepts and discuss recent developments related to the use of time-to-event endpoints in studies on adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for colon, pancreatic, and gastric adenocarcinomas. The definition of endpoints has varied to a considerable extent in these settings. Although these variations are relevant in interpreting results from individual trials, they probably have a small impact when considered in aggregate. In terms of surrogacy, most published reports so far have used aggregated data. A few studies based on the preferred method of a metaanalysis of individual-patient data have shown that disease-free survival (DFS) is a surrogate for overall survival in the adjuvant therapy of stage III colon cancer and in gastric cancer, whereas DFS with a landmark of six months is a surrogate for overall survival in the neoadjuvant therapy of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or stomach.\\nTesting novel agents in gastrointestinal cancer requires continued attention to statistical issues related to endpoints. A 59-year-old woman had a history of distal gastrectomy and D2 dissection in May 200X for advanced gastric cancer(GC) in the antrum area. The pathological stage was poorly differentiated, T2(SS), N2, H0, P0, CY0, M0, pStage ⅢA. After administration of S-1 for 1 year as adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient underwent surveillance with no recurrence. However, remnant GC was diagnosed in April 200X+12. Considering that there was no indication for curative resection due to severe invasion of the proper hepatic artery, gastrojejunostomy was performed for the anastomotic stenosis. Although the patient was administered 3 courses of S-1 plus oxaliplatin therapy as first-line treatment, partial response was not achieved. Therefore, chemoradiotherapy(CRT)with capecitabine was administered for local tumor control. Complete response was achieved, and the patient underwent surveillance with no recurrence 16 months after the recurrence. There were no serious acute adverse events(AEs)during CRT and late AEs after CRT. The patient was successfully treated with CRT for locally advanced remnant GC. Although there is no standard treatment for locally advanced remnant GC, this case showed the effectiveness of CRT. Ramucirumab(RAM)plus nab-paclitaxel(nab-PTX)therapy is a regimen that is recommended for the second round of chemotherapy in recurrent, progressive gastric cancer. We report the first case of a thoracic aortic dissection developed during RAM plus nab-PTX therapy. A 59-year-old male who had undergone a proximal gastrectomy for esophagogastric junction cancer had a recurrence of cancer 6 years later(metastasis to the para-aortic lymph node and left adrenal gland, local recurrence, and multiple bone metastases). He was treated with RAM plus nab-PTX therapy for second-line chemotherapy. On day 9 of the third cycle, he experienced sudden, severe neck pain and visited the outpatient emergency department. Computed tomography detected a Stanford type-A thoracic aortic dissection. However, the patient suffered from a myocardial infarction before the operation, and died. This is the first report of an aortic dissection associated with RAM. Clinicians must be aware of this complication. Immune checkpoint inhibitors(nivolumab)have been recommended as third-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer(AGC)according to the Guidelines of Gastric Cancer(5th edition). Therefore, they have been used in daily clinical practice. On the other hand, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio(NLR)has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of cancer patients.\\nTwenty patients treated with nivolumab for AGC between January 2018 and November 2019 were retrospectively examined.\\nMedian age of the 20 patients(18 males, 2 females)was 70 years(55- 84 years). Nivolumab was administered as second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-line therapy in 1, 11, 7, and 1 case, respectively. The best tumor response evaluation was observed in PR 1, SD 7 and PD 10 cases. Median overall survival(OS)was 10 months, and median progression-free survival(PFS)was 3 months. No serious adverse events occurred. Compared to the NLR>2.0 group, OS significantly prolonged(2.2 months vs 21.9 months)and PFS tended to prolong(1.4 months vs 6.2 months)in the NLR≤2.0 group.\\nNLR may be an effective prognostic factor in patients with AGC receiving nivolumab treatment. Choi IJ, Kim CG, Lee JY, et al.  Although cancer patients are known to experience mental disorders and face suicide risk, little is known about the relationship between mental illness and death by suicide in this group. As such, this study aims to examine the association between mental disorders and suicide risk among cancer patients. We used nationally representative cohort data, and included newly diagnosed cancer patients from 2004 to 2012 with whom we followed-up throughout 2013. We used the clinical diagnoses of all mental disorders as an independent variable and suicide death as a dependent variable to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of suicide deaths in patients with cancer using a Cox proportional hazard model. Among total cancer patients ( Gastrokines (GKNs) are anti-inflammatory proteins secreted by gastric epithelial (surface mucous and pit) cells, with their aberrant loss of expression causally linked to premalignant inflammation and gastric cancer (GC). Transcriptional mechanisms accounting for GKN expression loss have not been elucidated. Using human clinical cohorts, mouse transgenics, bioinformatics, and transfection/reporter assays, we report a novel mechanism of GKN gene transcriptional regulation and its impairment in GC.  The incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) following oesophagogastrectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction is reported to be between 1.7% and 50%. This variation is due to differing practices of intraoperative pylorus drainage procedures, which increase the risk of postoperative biliary reflux and dumping syndrome, resulting in significant morbidity. The aim of our study was to establish rates of DGE in people undergoing oesophagogastrectomy without routine intraoperative drainage procedures, and to evaluate outcomes of postoperative endoscopically administered \\nAll patients undergoing oesophagogastrectomy between 1 January 2016 and 31 March 2018 at our unit were included. No intraoperative pyloric drainage procedures were performed, and DGE resistant to systemic pharmacotherapy was managed with EBP.\\nNinety-seven patients were included. Postoperatively, 29 patients (30%) were diagnosed with DGE resistant to pharmacotherapy. Of these, 16 (16.5%) were diagnosed within 30 days of surgery. The median pre-procedure nasogastric tube aspirate was 780ml; following EBP, this fell to 125ml (\\nThis is the largest series of patients without routine intraoperative drainage procedures. Only 30% of patients developed DGE resistant to pharmacotherapy, which was managed safely with EBP in the postoperative period, thus minimising the risk of biliary reflux in people who would otherwise be at risk following prophylactic pylorus drainage procedures. Non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPNs) are a set of enzymes involved in the tyrosyl phosphorylation. The present study intended to clarify the associations between the expression patterns of PTPN family members, and diagnosis as well as the prognosis of digestive tract cancers.\\nOncomine and Ualcan were used to analyze PTPN expressions. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded through UCSC Xena for validation and to explore the relationship of the PTPN expression with diagnosis, clinicopathological parameters and survival of digestive tract cancers. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was conducted using the DAVID database. The gene-gene interaction network was performed by GeneMANIA and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built using STRING portal coupled with Cytoscape. The expression of differentially expressed PTPNs in cancer cell lines were explored using CCLE. Moreover, by histological verification, the expression of four PTPNs in digestive tract cancers were further analyzed.\\nMost PTPN family members were associated with digestive tract cancers according to Oncomine, Ualcan and TCGA data. Several PTPN members were differentially expressed in digestive tract cancers. For esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), PTPN1 and PTPN12 levels were correlated with incidence; PTPN20 was associated with poor prognosis. For stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), PTPN2 and PTPN12 levels were correlated with incidence; PTPN3, PTPN5, PTPN7, PTPN11, PTPN13, PTPN14, PTPN18 and PTPN23 were correlated with pathological grade; PTPN20 expression was related with both TNM stage and N stage; PTPN22 was associated with T stage and pathological grade; decreased expression of PTPN5 and PTPN13 implied worse overall survival of STAD, while elevated PTPN6 expression indicated better prognosis. For colorectal cancer (CRC), PTPN2, PTPN21 and PTPN22 levels were correlated with incidence; expression of PTPN5, PTPN12, and PTPN14 was correlated with TNM stage and N stage; high PTPN5 or PTPN7 expression was associated with increased hazards of death. CCLE analyses showed that in esophagus cancer cell lines, PTPN1, PTPN4 and PTPN12 were highly expressed; in gastric cancer cell lines, PTPN2 and PTPN12 were highly expressed; in colorectal cancer cell lines, PTPN12 was highly expressed while PTPN22 was downregulated. Results of histological verification experiment showed differential expressions of PTPN22 in CRC, and PTPN12 in GC and CRC.\\nMembers of PTPN family were differentially expressed in digestive tract cancers. Correlations were found between PTPN genes and clinicopathological parameters of patients. Expression of PTPN12 was upregulated in both STAD and CRC, and thus could be used as a diagnostic biomarker. Differential expression of PTPN12 in GC and CRC, and PTPN22 in CRC were presented in our histological verification experiment. We aimed to present the temporal and geographical trends in the incidence of stomach cancer in the Golestan province, a high-risk area in Northern Iran.\\nThis study was conducted on stomach cancer cases registered in the Golestan Population-based Cancer Registry (GPCR) during 2004-2016. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100000 person-years were calculated. The Joinpoint regression analysis was used to calculate the average annual percent changes (AAPC). We also calculated the contribution of population aging, population size and risk to the overall changes in incidence rates.\\nOverall, 2964 stomach cancer patients were registered. The ASR of stomach cancer was significantly higher in men (26.9) than women (12.2) (P<0.01). There was a significant decreasing trend in incidence of stomach cancer in men (AAPC=-1.80, 95% CI: -3.30 to-0.28; P=0.02). We found a higher ASR of stomach cancer in the rural (21.4) than urban (18.1) (P=0.04) population, as well as a significant decreasing trend in its rates (AAPC=-2.14, 95% CI: -3.10to-1.17; P<0.01). The number of new cases of stomach cancer increased by 22.33% (from 215 in 2004 to 263 in 2016), of which 18.1%, 25.1% and -20.9% were due to population size, population aging and risk, respectively. Our findings suggest a higher rate for stomach cancer in eastern areas.\\nWe found high incidence rates as well as temporal and geographical diversities in ASR of stomach cancer in Golestan, Iran. Our results showed an increase in the number of new cases, mainly due to population size and aging. Further studies are warranted to determine the risk factors of this cancer in this high-risk population.  Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world. Preoperative staging of gastric cancer has assumed pivotal role in deciding appropriate management of gastric cancer with multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) using hydro- and gaseous distension of stomach superseding endoscopic ultrasound in tumor (T) and nodal (N) staging. We undertook this study to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MDCT in the T and N staging of gastric cancer with an attempt to differentiate between early and advanced gastric carcinomas.\\nA total of 160 patients with endoscopically diagnosed and biopsy-proven gastric cancer were subjected to MDCT after adequate gaseous and hydro-distention of stomach. Multi-planar reformatted (MPR) as well as virtual gastroscopy images were also obtained. Gastric lesions were categorized into T1 to T4 stages with N staging from N0 to N3. Preoperative CT findings were correlated with histopathological findings.\\nOverall diagnostic accuracy of T staging in our study was 82.5% (132/160) with an accuracy of 75% (120/160) for N staging. The diagnostic accuracy of CT for early gastric carcinoma in our study was 93.75% with high specificity of 96% but low sensitivity of 66.7%.\\nMDCT using gaseous and hydro-distension of stomach is an excellent modality for near accurate preoperative T staging of gastric cancer. However, CT has a limited role in the N staging of gastric cancer. This study also suggested that the combined use of virtual gastroscopy and MPR images helps in better detection of early gastric cancers. Structural and numeric centrosome aberrations can induce chromosome segregation errors and promote tumor development and progression. We systematically evaluated associations of 19,603 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 136 centrosome-related genes with gastric cancer (GC) risk using four GWAS datasets with a total of 3771 cases and 5426 controls. We identified two loci at 15p13.3 and 7q11.23 significantly associated with GC risk, whose risk alleles were correlated with increased mRNA expression of CEP72 (P\\u2009=\\u20097.30\\u2009×\\u200910 DNA topoisomerases essentially remove topological strains generated during DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair, and other cytogenetic processes. However, distinct expression level and prognostic significance of individual topoisomerase isoforms in gastric cancer (GC) remain largely unexplored. In this study, we utilized Oncomine and Kaplan-Meier plotter database to detect the mRNA expression level of individual topoisomerase isoforms as well as assess their prognostic significance in GC patients. With the exception of TOP3B and TOP2B, levels of all topoisomerase isoforms were found to be elevated in GC patients when compared to the normal tissues. Elevated expression of TOP1 and TOP1MT was relevant to longer overall survival (OS) in GC and gastric intestinal type adenocarcinoma (GITA) patients, but not in diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma (DFA) patients. Increased expression of TOP2A and TOP2B was related to better OS in GC, as well as in GITA and DFA patients. In contrast, increased expression TOP3A and TOP3B was associated with shorter OS in GC, as well as in GITA and DFA patients. We also applied the Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) tool to assess the correlations between distinct topoisomerase isoforms and the infiltrating immune cell landscape. Furthermore, we found that down-regulating the expression of TOP3A by shRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation in GC cells compared to control shRNA treated cells. Thus our study lays the framework for utilizing topoisomerases in better understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of GC and for developing strategies for novel customized therapy in GC patients. Leclercia sp. W6 and W17, which belong to the Enterobacteriaceae, were isolated from a stomach sample from a 78-year-old female gastric cancer patient, and genomic sequencing and analysis were performed. The genome of Leclercia sp. W6 consists of one chromosome with a size of 4,945,486 bp, while that of Leclercia sp. W17 contains one chromosome and two plasmids with a total size of 5,125,645 bp. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculations indicated that strains W6 and W17 exhibited similarities\\u2009<\\u200991.0% to other strains within the Enterobacteriaceae, except for six Leclercia strains. Phylogenomic analysis based on core-genome showed that strains W6 and W17 belong to the genus Leclercia, and phylogenetic analysis based on ANI values revealed that strains W6 and W17 formed an independent clade from those six Leclercia strains. Furthermore, comparative genomic analysis revealed that strains W6 and W17 had 5086 orthologous clusters (OCs) in their pan-genomes, and 59 exclusive OCs which were absent in their closest relatives. Genomic annotations revealed that the genomes of strains W6 and W17 encoded genes related to multidrug resistance clusters, multiple antibiotic resistance loci, and multidrug efflux pumps and had an identical urease gene cluster and a dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathway. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that strains W6 and W17 represented a novel species within the genus Leclercia. Genomic annotations revealed that these strains encoded genes related to multidrug resistance, nitrate reduction, and urease activity, which contribute to gastric malignant transformation. This will broaden our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms of the Enterobacteriaceae and help improve the clinical conditions of gastric cancer patients. A 60-year-old woman presented with melena for 2 weeks. She had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to treat clear cell endometrial carcinoma 10 months before the presentation. She was anaemic and tachycardic; abdominal CT scan revealed a large duodenal mass. Her gastrointestinal bleed was not amenable to endoscopic intervention, so she had emergent laparotomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy with duodenal mass excision. Histopathology confirmed that the duodenal mass was a metastatic deposit from her clear cell endometrial cancer. Postoperatively, she was frail and chose hospice care and she died 90 days postoperatively. Clear cell endometrial cancer is a rare subtype of endometrial cancer, that has a worse prognosis compared with the more common endometrioid subtype. The duodenum is a rare site for metastatic endometrial cancer, and we report this case to alert clinicians to the possibility of metastases to the small intestine in patients with clear cell endometrial cancer. Stomach cancer is essentially represented by gastric adenocarcinomas. It remains one of the world\\'s top ten causes of death with a poor prognosis. The aim of our work is to describe the epidemiological characteristics of gastric adenocarcinoma through a retrospective, observational study over a period of one year. One hundred and twenty one cases were sent to the Pathology Laboratory of the IPM-Casablanca, 98 were selected for this study. There was a male predominance. Patients aged over 50 years represented the predominant age group (62%) (P-value=0.03). The average tumor size was 5,17±2,16cm, and most patients were diagnosed in the advanced TNM stage with a rate of 72.44%. In the absence of specific symptoms, gastric adenocarcinoma is a cancer of elderly, frequently diagnosed at a late stage, minimizing the chances of any curable treatment. The adoption of a screening policy in our area would probably be beneficial. Indeed, the benefit of annual screening at least among people aged over 50 years should be assessed. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric cancer (GC) is one of four major gastric cancer types and is traditionally considered to be related to lymphoepithelioma-like GC. Few studies have investigated the clinical significance of EBV infection in intestinal/solid type, diffuse (poorly cohesive) type, and lymphoepithelioma-like GC.\\nA total of 460 GC patients receiving curative surgery were enrolled. The clinicopathological features, genetic alterations and prognoses were compared between patients with and without EBV infection.\\nEBV-positive GC patients (\\nIntestinal/solid type GC patients with EBV-positive tumors were associated with higher PD-L1 expression and more liver metastases, while lymphoepithelioma-like GC patients with EBV-positive tumors had more PI3K/AKT pathway mutations. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy may be beneficial for these groups of patients. Routine EBV survey is recommended in GC. Gastric carcinoma (GC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancy characterized by early metastasis. Unlike that of cellular micro(mi)RNAs, the role of viral miRNAs in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in cancers has not been fully investigated. In this study, we elucidated the involvement of miR-BART11, an EBV-encoded viral miRNA, in the EMT and metastasis of GC cells. EBV-miR-BART11 upregulation can lead to downregulation of forkhead box protein P1 (FOXP1) in both tissues and cell lines of gastric carcinoma. Downregulation of FOXP1 might trigger the secretion of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and 1L-10 in cancer cells, resulting in poor survival of GC patients. We found that the observed EMT phenotypes resulted from the EBV-miR-BART11 overexpression-induced FOXP1 downregulation, which impacted the expression of the EMT-transcription factors E-cadherin and snail. We further demonstrated that conditioned medium-derived tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promoted phenotypic changes and expression of EMT-related molecules in GC cells. Additionally, EMT changes were significantly promoted in GC cells cultured in conditioned medium from TAMs infected with EBV-miR-BART11-containing lentivirus. On the contrary, GC cells cultured in conditioned medium from TAMs infected with FOXP1-carrying lentivirus showed little or no EMT change. Taken together, our results suggest that EBV-encoded viral miRNA BART11 downregulates the FOXP1 transcription factor, and promotes EMT by directly influencing gastric tumor cells or indirectly affecting the tumor microenvironment, which might, in turn, accelerate cancer invasion and metastasis, thereby affecting the survival and prognosis of patients. None Differently from other digestive malignancies, gastric cancer (GC) pathobiology is still little known and understood. Recently, cytopathology and molecular biology on gastric juice/gastric lavage (GJ/GL) of GC patients have provided novel and interesting results in terms of screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. However, entertaining cytologic examination and molecular test as a unified solo-run test is previously unreported. Our aim was to assess the new parameter \"GL Ca 72.4\" for GC patients.\\nBetween April 2012 and July 2013, GJ/GL obtained from 37 surgical GC patients were tested for the presence/absence (GL1/GL0) of exfoliated malignant cells along with the intragastric concentration of Ca 72.4 (normal value <6.49 ng/mL: Ca 72.4n; elevated level ≥6.49 ng/mL: Ca 72.4+).\\nAt a median follow-up of 79.3 months, all the GC alive patients were \"GL0 Ca 72.4n.\" The \"GL1 Ca 72.4+\" parameter, in comparison with GL0 Ca 72.4n, strongly correlated with deeper tumor invasion (p = 0.027), severe nodal metastasis (p = 0.012), worst metastatic node ratio (p = 0.041), higher number of metastatic lymph nodes (30 vs. 20 nodes, p = 0.014), angiolymphatic invasion (p = 0.044), advanced stage (p = 0.034), and adjuvant therapy (p = 0.044). The Kaplan-Meier model showed that GL1 Ca 72.4+ subjects had shorter overall survival (OS) than GL0 Ca 72.4n cases (9.7 vs. 43.2 months, respectively, p = 0.042). At univariate analysis, the GL1 Ca 72.4+ parameter resulted a significant prognostic factor for OS (p = 0.023).\\nThe combined cyto-molecular parameter \"GL1 Ca 72.4+\" appears to be a strong indicator of aggressive tumor behavior and a significant prognostic factor of poor survival for GC patients. None A low intake of fruits and vegetables is a risk factor for gastric cancer, although there is uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the associations. In our study, the relationship between fruits and vegetables intake and gastric cancer was assessed, complementing a previous work on the association betweenconsumption of citrus fruits and gastric cancer. Data from 25 studies (8456 cases and 21\\u2009133 controls) with information on fruits and/or vegetables intake were used. A two-stage approach based on random-effects models was used to pool study-specific adjusted (sex, age and the main known risk factors for gastric cancer) odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Exposure-response relations, including linear and nonlinear associations, were modeled using one- and two-order fractional polynomials. Gastric cancer risk was lower for a higher intake of fruits (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64-0.90), noncitrus fruits (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.73-1.02), vegetables (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.56-0.84), and fruits and vegetables (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49-0.75); results were consistent across sociodemographic and lifestyles categories, as well as study characteristics. Exposure-response analyses showed an increasingly protective effect of portions/day of fruits (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57-0.73 for six portions), noncitrus fruits (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.83 for six portions) and vegetables (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.43-0.60 for 10 portions). A protective effect of all fruits, noncitrus fruits and vegetables was confirmed, supporting further dietary recommendations to decrease the burden of gastric cancer. Surgical resection remains the primary choice of treatment and the only potentially curative option for gastric carcinoma, and is increasingly performed laparoscopically. Gastric resection represents a challenging procedure, with a significant morbidity and non-negligible postoperative mortality. The interpretation of imaging after gastric surgery can be challenging due to significant modifications of the normal anatomy. After the surgery, the familiarity with expected imaging appearances is crucial for diagnosis and appropriate management of potentially life-threatening complications in patients who underwent gastric surgery. We review various surgical techniques used in gastric surgery and describe fluoroscopic and cross-sectional imaging appearances of normal postoperative anatomic changes as well as early and late complications after gastric surgery. Cancer is the uncontrolled division of cells and can be caused by genetic or environmental factors. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest among all cancers. The role of bacteria as an anticancer agent dates back to almost 100\\xa0years ago. The microbiome has recently become a focus of research in carcinogenesis and even pancreatic cancer. Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative bacterium, which causes shigellosis with symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps in human. Shigella flexneri may play a very important role in the internal pathways of apoptosis and may induce apoptosis in some of the cancerous cells.\\nIn this experiment bacteria were cultured on Salmonella-Shigella agar, then inoculated into BHI Broth medium. After sonication, the protein concentration of the bacterium was measured by using the ZellBio Sensitive Protein Bradford Assay kit. MTT assay was performed to obtain IC\\nThe results showed that Shigella flexneri has the potential anti-proliferative effect in pancreatic cancer. The inhibitory concentration, pro-apoptotic amount to upregulate Bax, and meanwhile also to downregulate the bcl-2 found to be 10\\xa0μl.\\nIn general, due to defects in the apoptotic pathway in cancer cells and the existence of drug-resistant cells, the detection of new apoptotic inducers such as Shigella flexneri cell extract can be used for further studies on cancer therapy. Persistent \\nTo evaluate the clinicopathological features of early gastric cancer in \\nA total of 2462 patients with 3375 instances of early gastric cancers that were treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection were enrolled in our study between May 2000 and September 2019. Of these, 30 lesions in 30 patients were diagnosed as \\nThe frequency of HpUIGC was 1.2% (30/2462) for the patients in our study. The study included 19 males and 11 females with a mean age of 59 years. The location of the stomach lesions was divided into three sections; upper third (U), middle third (M), lower third (L). Of the 30 lesions, 15 were U, 1 was M, and 14 were L. Morphologically, 17 lesions were protruded and flat elevated type (0-I, 0-IIa, 0-IIa + IIc), and 13 lesions were flat and depressed type (0-IIb, 0-IIc). The median tumor diameter was 8 mm (range 2-98 mm). Histological analysis revealed that 22 lesions (73.3%) were differentiated type.The HpUIGC lesions were classified into fundic gland type adenocarcinoma (7 cases), foveolar type well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (8 cases), intestinal phenotype adenocarcinoma (7 cases), and pure signet-ring cell carcinoma (8 cases). Among 30 HpUIGCs, 24 lesions (80%) were limited to the mucosa; wherein, the remaining 6 lesions showed submucosal invasion. One of the submucosal invasive lesions showed more than 500 μm invasion. The mucin phenotype analysis identified 7 HpUIGC with intestinal phenotype and 23 with gastric phenotype.\\nWe elucidated the clinicopathological characteristics of HpUIGC, revealing recognition not only undifferentiated-type but also differentiated-type. In addition, intestinal phenotype tumors were also observed and could be an important tip. The therapeutic role of D2 lymphadenectomy in the management of gastric cancer is an ongoing controversy.\\nTo examine the morbidity and oncological outcomes of D2 lymph node dissection for gastric cancer patients treated in a stand-alone cancer center in rural India and to compare it with international data.\\nRetrospective study on patients treated for gastric cancer from June 2009 to December 2014.\\nAll patients underwent subtotal or total gastrectomy with modified D2 lymph node dissection preserving spleen and pancreas. The Clavien-Dindo model was used to stratify the severity of morbidity.\\nDescriptive statistics was used for data exploration. Chi-square test was used to compare the association of various factors with survival. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival rates (RFS and DFS). Log-rank test was used to compare the survival of different subgroups.\\nFifty-four patients (41 males and 13 females) were included in the study. Four (7.4%) patients had significant postoperative morbidity. The 5-year OS and DFS respectively were 34.9% and 37.6%. Female sex was associated with poorer survival. Lymph node ratio of more than 0.2 and advanced stage at presentation showed strong tendency towards lower OS and DFS.\\nAn R0 resection with D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer carries acceptable morbidity and mortality in Indian patients with survival rates comparable with the western studies. Lymph node ratio more than 0.2 and female gender and advanced stage were associated with poorer oncological outcomes. No predictive markers for chemotherapy activity have been validated in gastric cancer (GC). The potential value of class III β-tubulin (TUBB3) as biomarker for prognosis and resistance to taxane-based therapy was reported.\\nWe analyzed GC samples of patients enrolled in the Intergroup Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach (ITACA-S), a randomized adjuvant study comparing 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) and docetaxel-based sequential chemotherapy. TUBB3 was quantitated by selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry and patients were stratified using a threshold of 750 attomoles per microgram (amol/µg). Cox proportional modeling and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to assess the impact of TUBB3 expression on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival.\\nPatients with TUBB3 protein levels >750 and <750 amol/µg were 21.9% and 78.1%, respectively, and were well-balanced between treatment arms. TUBB3 protein levels were not prognostic. Whereas no survival differences according to the 2 arms were observed in the subgroup with low TUBB3 expression (5-year OS 47% vs 40%; \\nThe quantification of TUBB3 might be considered as a negative predictive biomarker of benefit from taxane-based therapy in GC. Studies are needed to evaluate its role in the neoadjuvant setting. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in China, while the nature of genetic factors related to GC has not been well-studied.\\nTo assess the inherited genetic factors regarding pathogenic germline mutations in Chinese GC population.\\nGenomic profiling of DNA was performed through next-generation sequencing with 381 cancer-related genes on tissue from patients with GC between January 1, 2017, and May 7, 2019.\\n470 GC patients were included for analysis. A total of 28 (6.0%) patients were identified to harbor 25 different pathogenic or very likely pathogenic germline mutations in 15 genes. The variants fell most frequently in BRCA2 (n = 6, 1.28%), CHEK2 (n = 5, 1.06%), MUTYH (n = 3, 0.64%), CDH1 (n = 2, 0.43%), and ATM (n = 2, 0.43%). Of all the germline-mutated genes, 66.7% (n = 10) lay in the DNA damage repair pathways. Seven patients were identified to have a high TMB status, among whom two were also identified as MSI-H. Overall, 20 out of the 28 patients (71.4%) carried clinically actionable mutations.\\nOur study has depicted the spectrum of pathogenic germline mutations in Chinese GC patients, which may provide valuable clues for the assessment of the genetic susceptibility and clinical management in GC. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome associated with an increased risk of developing Laurén\\'s diffuse-type gastric carcinoma and lobular breast carcinoma. Although signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) in situ (SRCC-pTis) has been reported as a characteristic lesion in HDGC cases with CDH1 germline mutations (CDH1 pathogenic variant), and a precursor of conventional intramucosal SRCC (SRCC-pT1a), its histopathologic features and specificity have not been sufficiently clarified. Here, we examined gastrectomy samples from 6 Japanese HDGC patients with CDH1 germline mutation, belonging to 4 families, and analyzed SRCC lesions histologically and immunohistochemically. Of the 274 foci found in the 6 samples, SRCC-pT1a accounted for 225 lesions (range: 8 to 107, mean 45.7 lesions per patient), while 46 foci were of SRCC-pTis (range: 1 to 15, mean 7.67 foci per patient). All SRCC-pTis foci were observed in the fundic gland area and on the superficial side of the mucosa. Histologically, tumor cells of SRCC-pTis were found between normal foveolar epithelial cells and the basement membrane, following a typical pagetoid spread pattern. Immunohistochemically, E-cadherin expression was lost in SRCC-pTis (27/28, 96.4%) more frequently than in SRCC-pT1a (95/197, 48.2%; P<0.001). To elucidate the specificity of SRCC-pTis for HDGC, 60 samples (range: 0.12 to 1.49\\u2009m, total 28.8\\u2009m of mucosal length) from gastric cancer cases were analyzed as controls, in which no SRCC-pTis were identified. Our results indicate that SRCC-pTis is a distinct histologic feature with high specificity for HDGC cases with CDH1 germline mutations. None Infection with the Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) can be molecularly classified based on different subtypes including mutations in  Adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) is a rare but rising tumor entity in the Western world. Treatment is complex, as multimodality is key to optimal results. However, trials solely including AEG are rare, and the question if neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (NRCT) or neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy (NACT) is superior remains unanswered.\\nPatients with AEG I-III treated between October 2010 and August 2019 at the Ordensklinikum Linz or the Kepler University Hospital were identified either from a monitored tumor registry or by chart review. Time-to-event data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Fisher\\'s exact test were used for comparing continuous and categorical data, respectively.\\nA total of 85 patients (median age 63 years; median Charlson Comorbidity Index 3; 98.8% ECOG PS 0-1) were analyzed. Of these, 52 patients received NRCT (81% CROSS protocol) and 33 NACT (65% EOX and 35% FLOT protocol). There was a significantly higher pathological complete response rate in the NRCT group (30 vs. 12%; p = 0.010); distant relapse rates were higher in the NRCT group and local relapse rates were higher in the NACT group (both not significant). These differences, however, did not translate into a different disease-free survival (20 months; 95% CI: 13-34) or overall survival (44 months; 95% CI: 33-NA). Patients >65 years old had the same advantage from treatment as patients <65 years of age.\\nAlthough treatment of AEG is complex, the progress documented over the last centuries can be reproduced in our real-life setting. Data regarding the superiority of either type of neoadjuvant/perioperative treatment are sparse. We assume no difference between EOX-based NACT and NRCT. Aim To evaluate dynamics of biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction (ED), including endothelin-1 (ET-1) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) in patients with stomach cancer (adenocarcinoma) before and after polychemotherapy (PCT); to compare these results with respective values in healthy volunteers and patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD); to study correlations of the ED biomarkers with indexes of instrumental evaluation of endothelial dysfunction.Material and methods The study included 75 participants, including 25 healthy volunteers (control group), 25 patients with documented CVDs (arterial hypertension + ischemic heart disease), and 25 patients of the main group with histologically documented stage II-IV stomach cancer (adenocarcinoma) who received different courses of PCT with platinum-based agents (oxaliplatin, cisplatin) and fluoropyrimidines (5 fluorouracil, capecitabin). Laboratory measurement of ED biomarkers, computerized nailfold video capillaroscopy (CNVC), and finger laser photoplethysmography (PPG) (methods for noninvasive evaluation of vascular wall and ED), electrocardiography, 24-h ECG Holter monitoring, and echocardiography (EchoCG) were performed for all patients of the main group prior to PCT and within one months after the last course completion. This evaluation was performed once for healthy volunteers and patients of the CVD group upon inclusion into the study.Results In the main group, ET-1 levels were non-significantly lower than normal and did not change during the courses of antitumor treatment (0.95 [0.6; 1.4] and 0.94 [0.7; 1.4]\\u2008pg\\u200a/ml (р&lt;0.9) before and after PCT, respectively). Statistically significant differences were found between the control group and oncological patients after the treatment (р&lt;0.04). Levels of VWF remained within the normal range in all examined participants and did not significantly differ between study groups, including oncological patients before and after the specific treatment (р&gt;0.05 for all comparisons). The correlation analysis detected significant correlations of ET-1 levels with functional disorders of microcirculation, ET-1 with the occlusion index (rs=0.56; p=0.005), ЕТ-1 with percentage of capillary restoration (PCR, rs= -0.72; p=0.018) and with the incidence rate of supraventricular extrasystole (rs=0.48; p=0.032).Conclusion The dynamics of ED biomarkers was studied for the first time in patients with stomach cancer receiving a specific antitumor therapy. Although no significant changes in ЕТ-1 and VWF were observed during the PCT (probably due to exhaustion of the endothelial system and a small patient sample), these indexes can be considered as early vasculotoxicity markers due to the presence of significant correlations with indexes of impaired endothelial function according to the results of instrumental evaluation. A 76-year-old man had a diagnosis of double primary cancers consisting of poorly differentiated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) invading the submucosa and poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) invading the submucosa. The clinical stage of both ESCC and GAC was T1N0M0 stage I. The tumor diameter of ESCC and GAC was 20\\xa0mm and 25\\xa0mm, respectively. We performed chemoradiotherapy for ESCC. Chemotherapy consisted of nedaplatin in an intravenous dose of 90\\xa0mg/m Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer [EBV-associated GC, EBV(\\u2009+) GC] is a distinct molecular subtype of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. It accounts for up to 10% of all molecular subtypes of gastric cancer (GC). It has unique genetic and epigenetic features, which determine its definitive phenotype with male and younger age predominance, proximal stomach localization, and diffuse adenocarcinoma histology. EBV(\\u2009+) GC also has a unique epigenetic profile and mutational status with frequent mutations of PIK3CA, ARID1A and BCOR, and PD-L1 and PD-L2 amplifications, as well. The aim of this review is to highlight clinical significance of EBV(\\u2009+) GC and prognostic role of EBV infection, and to determine potentially appropriate drug therapy for this disease. During the last few years, determination of microstatellite instability (MSI) status has become a routine part of clinical practice, essentially to detect Lynch syndrome. Recently, MSI testing has increased with the development of immunotherapy and has expanded to a large panel of solid tumours. The aim of our work was to evaluate a fully automated system developed by Biocartis, the Idylla MSI Test, which performs an MSI analysis within 150\\u2009min.\\nA comparison between pentaplex PCR, immunohistochemistry and Idylla MSI Test was performed in 53 colorectal carcinoma samples, 7 small intestine adenocarcinomas, 15 duodenal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 16 gastric tumours, 15 endometrial adenocarcinomas, 5 ovarian carcinomas and 4 cases of urinary tract tumours using extracted DNA. Limit-of-detection (LOD) experiment was also done using a commercial DNA known to harbour MSI phenotype.\\nThe overall sensitivity was 94% and the overall specificity was 100%. Two invalid and three false-negative results were observed. Our experiments showed that the amount of DNA loaded into the cartridge was decisive and should be superior to 25\\u2009ng. LOD comprised between 4% and 8%.\\nOverall, we have demonstrated that the Idylla MSI Test is a rapid and valid option to detect MSI phenotype which can be used in a large panel of solid tumours. Glutamine is a major dietary amino acid that is both a fuel and nitrogen donor for healing tissues damaged by chemotherapy and radiation. Evidence supports the benefit of oral (enteral) glutamine to reduce symptoms and improve and/or maintain quality of life of cancer patients. Benefits include not only better nutrition, but also decreased mucosal damage (mucositis, stomatitis, pharyngitis, esophagitis, and enteritis). Glutamine supplementation in a high protein diet (10 grams/day) + disaccharides, such as sucrose and/or trehalose, is a combination that increases glutamine uptake by mucosal cells. This increased topical effect can reduce painful mucosal symptoms and ulceration associated with chemotherapy and radiation in the head and neck region, esophagus, stomach and small intestine. Topical and oral glutamine seem to be the preferred routes for this amino acid to promote mucosal healing during and after cancer treatment. A considerable amount of health record (HR) data has been stored due to recent advances in the digitalization of medical systems. However, it is not always easy to analyze HR data, particularly when the number of persons with a target disease is too small in comparison with the population. This situation is called the imbalanced data problem. Over-sampling and under-sampling are two approaches for redressing an imbalance between minority and majority examples, which can be combined into ensemble algorithms. However, these approaches do not function when the absolute number of minority examples is small, which is called the extremely imbalanced and small minority (EISM) data problem. The present work proposes a new algorithm called boosting combined with heuristic under-sampling and distribution-based sampling (HUSDOS-Boost) to solve the EISM data problem. To make an artificially balanced dataset from the original imbalanced datasets, HUSDOS-Boost uses both under-sampling and over-sampling to eliminate redundant majority examples based on prior boosting results and to generate artificial minority examples by following the minority class distribution. The performance and characteristics of HUSDOS-Boost were evaluated through application to eight imbalanced datasets. In addition, the algorithm was applied to original clinical HR data to detect patients with stomach cancer. These results showed that HUSDOS-Boost outperformed current imbalanced data handling methods, particularly when the data are EISM. Thus, the proposed HUSDOS-Boost is a useful methodology of HR data analysis. This study assessed preoperative quality of life (QoL) of gastric cancer patients exposed to inconsistent illness information by pre-post-operative stage discordance. The impact of information-stressors on patients\\' QoL was investigated to determine information processing as a potential target for QoL management. Early-stage gastric cancer (EsGC) and late-stage gastric cancer (LsGC) groups based on their final stage were categorized by the consistency of preoperative staging information that was being shared. Those with consistent preoperative staging information were rated as EsGC (n=1,420) and LsGC (n=153) controls. EsGC and LsGC patients with misdirected information about their LsGC and EsGC were categorized as EsGC/iLsGC (n=32) and LsGC/iEsGC (n=55), respectively. Preoperative QoL data was obtained using EORTC QLQ-C30 and -STO22. QoL outcomes of EsGC/iLsGC and LsGC/iEsGC were compared with those of the EsGC and LsGC controls. QoL outcomes of the EsGC/iLsGC group matched that of EsGC control, but were significantly better than those of LsGC control on multiple scales including global health status/QoL, physical/role/social-functioning, and ten symptom scales/items. On the other hand, QoL outcomes of LsGC/iEsGC group were significantly better than those of LsGC control on multiple scales (global health status/QoL, physical/role-functioning, and nine symptom scales/items) while they roughly matched with those of EsGC control. Intensified information-stressors did not exacerbate QoL beyond the influence of the patients\\' medical condition, while de-intensified information-stressor improved QoL. Fear of negatively impacting QoL should not prevent the sharing of stressful illness information. As the de-intensified information-stressor improves QoL, information processing is recommended as a potential target for QoL management in cancer patients. Proximal gastrectomy (PG) has become an increasingly preferred procedure for early cancer in the upper third of the stomach, owing to reportedly superior quality of life (QOL) after PG when compared with total gastrectomy. However, various methods of reconstruction have currently been proposed. We compared the postoperative QOL among the three different reconstruction methods after PG using the Postgastrectomy Syndrome Assessment Scale-45 (PGSAS-45) questionnaire.\\nPost Gastrectomy Syndrome Assessment Study (PGSAS), a nationwide multi-institutional survey, was conducted to evaluate QOL using the PGSAS-45 among various types of gastrectomy. Of the 2,368 eligible data from the PGSAS survey, data from 193 patients who underwent PG were retrieved and used in the current study. The PGSAS-45 consists of 45 items including 22 original gastrectomy specific items in addition to the SF-8 and GSRS. These were consolidated into 19 main outcome measures pertaining postgastrectomy symptoms, amount of food ingested, quality of ingestion, work, and level of satisfaction for daily work, and the three reconstruction methods (n\\u2009=\\u2009193; 115 esophago-gastrostomy [PGEG], 34 jejunal interposition [PGJI], and 44 jejunal pouch interposition [PGJPI]) were compared using PGSAS-45.\\nSize of the remnant stomach was significantly larger in PGEG, and significantly smaller in PGJI and PGJPI (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). There was no difference in other patient background factors among the groups. EGJPI tended to be superior to PGEG in several of the 19 main outcome with marginal significance (P\\u2009=\\u20090.047-0.076).\\nPGJPI appears to be the most favorable of the three reconstruction methods after PG especially when the size of remnant stomach is rather small.\\nUMIN-CTR #000002116 entitled as \"A study to observe correlation between resection and reconstruction procedures employed for gastric neoplasms and development of postgastrectomy syndrome\". Although many studies have evaluated the prognostic significance of signet ring cell (SRC) histology for gastric cancer (GC) patients, the results were conflicting. The objective of this study was to compare clinicopathologic characteristics between SRC type and other types, and evaluate its impact on survival outcome.\\nWe retrospectively reviewed clinicopathologic and survival data of 1891 patients who underwent curative resection for GC. All patients were divided into differentiated, undifferentiated and SRC type according to the histological classification. The prognostic differences between different types were compared and clinicopathologic factors were analyzed.\\nSRC histology type had a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) than differentiated type (5-year DFS, 37.7% vs 52.2%, P<0.001), but there was no prognostic difference between SRC type and undifferentiated type (37.7% vs 41.9%, P>0.05). For early GC patients, SRC type was more frequent in younger, female patients and T1a stage tumors; the 5-year DFS of SRC type was similar to that of any other histology type (P>0.05). SRC type showed more aggressive biological features, including extensive stomach involvement, large tumor size, advanced pTstage and pN stage, than other types for locally advanced GC patients; poorer DFS was observed in SRC type compared with differentiated type. Multivariate analysis indicated that SRC type (HR:1.71, 95%CI:1.10-1.68, P<0.01) and undifferentiated type (HR:1.21, 95%CI:1.04-1.40, P<0.05) were independently associated with poor DFS in locally advanced GC patients.\\nThere was a significant difference between early and locally advanced GC patients with regard to clinicopathologic features and prognostic significance of SRC histology. SRC type was an independent prognostic factor for locally advanced GC patients, but not for early GC patients. No ideal and generally accepted method of reconstruction for laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG) has been established because of a high incidence of postoperative reflux and anastomotic stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term outcomes of LPG with a non-flap hand-sewn technique as a simple anti-reflux procedure for the upper part of clinical Stage I gastric cancer.\\nBetween November 2016 and June 2019, 23 consecutive gastric cancer patients, who underwent curative LPG with lymphadenectomy, were enrolled in the study. In this study, we devised a simple hand-sewn technique for esophagogastrostomy, which comprises a 5-cm pseudo-fornix as a fundoplication, the posterior pressure mechanism by the remnant stomach and bilateral crus, and a flat-shaped anastomotic hole as a valvuloplasty.\\nThe median operation time and hospital stay was 325\\xa0min and 10\\xa0days, respectively. There was no patient with anastomotic leakage and delayed gastric empting. No patient had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, but two patients (8.6% (2/23): Grade M and Grade A) had endoscopic findings during a follow-up period of more than 6\\xa0months. There was no patient with Grade B or more severe reflux esophagitis. One patient (4.3%, 1/23) developed anastomotic stenosis, which was resolved with endoscopic dilatation. The mean body weight loss at 6\\xa0months after surgery was 7.5% in comparison with the preoperative body weight.\\nOur non-flap hand-sewn technique for esophagogastrostomy had favorable outcomes and might be one of reliable techniques as an anti-reflux procedure in LPG for gastric cancer. This study aimed to further understand the role of relative telomere length (RTL) in susceptibility to gastric carcinoma (GC) and investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in the telomere length related genes and GC risk.RTL was measured using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction from 1000 patients and 1100 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using the Agena MassARRAY platform. The statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square/ Welch T tests, Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression analysis.The association analysis of telomere length and GC showed that the RTL in the case group was shorter than in the controls, and the shorter RTL was associated with an increased risk of GC. The association analysis between telomere length related genes polymorphisms and genetic susceptibility to GC indicated that: In the allele models and genetic models, TERT (rs10069690, rs2242652 and rs2853676) and TN1F1 (rs7708392 and rs10036748) were significantly associated with an increased risk of GC. In addition, the haplotype \\'Grs10069690Crs2242652\" of TERT and the haplotype \\'Grs7708392Trs10036748\" of TNIP1 were associated with an increased risk of GCOur results suggested that shorter RTL was associated with an increased risk of GC; The association analysis have identified that the TERT (rs10069690, rs2242652 and rs2853676) and TN1P1 (rs7708392 and rs10036748) were associated with GC risk. JLC has been widely applied as a promising adjunctive drug for GC. However, the exact effects and safety of JLC have yet to be systematically investigated. We aimed to summarize the efficacy and safety of JLC for the treatment of advanced GC through the meta-analysis, in order to provide scientific reference for the design of future clinical trials.\\nThe protocol followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols. Relevant randomized controlled trials were searched from Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science (WOS), Excerpt Medica Database (Embase), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and Wanfang Database. Papers in English or Chinese published from their inception to January 2020 will be included without any restrictions.Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by 2 investigators. The clinical outcomes including overall response rate, complete response rate, overall survival, Disease-free survival, quality of life (QoL), immune function, and adverse events, were systematically evaluated. Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 14.0 were used for data analysis, and the quality of the studies was also evaluated.\\nThe findings of this research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and provide more evidence-based guidance in clinical practice. INTERNATIONAL PLATFORM OF REGISTERED SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS PROTOCOLS (INPLASY) REGISTRATION NUMBER:: INPLASY202040105. URL: https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2020-4-0105/. We conducted a study to evaluate the prognostic and diagnostic values of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) in gastric cancer (GC) based on meta-analysis and TCGA database. Relevant studies were searched in English and Chinese database and meta-analysis was conducted on Stata 12.0. The expression value of miR-10b and clinical parameters of GC patients were downloaded from TCGA database, and relevant analyses were conducted on SPSS. High expression of miR-10b was linked with unfavorable overall survival (OS) in GC (HR\\u200a=\\u200a1.572, 95% CI: 1.240-1.992, P\\u200a<\\u200a.001). However, the meta-analysis was significant for patients in early stage, but not for patients in advanced stage. The expression of miR-10b-3p was significantly lower in cancer tissue compared with adjacent tissue (P\\u200a<\\u200a.001). Meanwhile, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was 0.652 (0.562-0.742), P\\u200a=\\u200a.001. Disease-free survival analysis showed increasing miR-10b-5p was correlated with worse survival outcome (HR\\u200a=\\u200a2.366, 95% CI: 1.414-3.959, P\\u200a=\\u200a.001). In conclusion, miR-10b acts as a tumor suppressor with prognostic and diagnostic values for GC. This study will be proposed for investigating the effects of high-quality nursing intervention (HQNI) on the psychological disorder in patients with gastric cancer during perioperative period (GC-PPP).\\nA cumulative search from inception up to the March 31, 2020 will be performed in the following databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, VIP database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. We will search all potential studies from those electronic databases regardless their language and publication status. We will only consider randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for inclusion, which explores the effect of HQNI on the psychological disorder in patients with GC-PPP. Study identification, information extraction, and study quality appraisal will be independently and respectively done by 2 researchers. Any different opinions between 2 researchers will be disentangled by a third researcher after discussion. Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used for study quality assessment, and RevMan 5.3 software will be utilized for statistical analysis.\\nThis study will provide a high-quality synthesis of psychological disorder outcomes to evaluate the effects and safety of HQNI for patients with GC-PPP.\\nThe findings of this study will provide reference and evidence to appraise whether HQNI is an effective on the psychological disorder in patients with GC-PPP STUDY REGISTRATION NUMBER:: INPLASY202040080. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most frequent mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Inactivating mutations or epigenetic deregulation of succinate dehydrogenase complex (SDH) genes are considered defining features of a subset of GIST occurring in the stomach. Based on comprehensive molecular profiling and biochemical analysis within a precision oncology program, we identified hallmarks of SDH deficiency (germline SDHB-inactivating mutation accompanied by somatic loss of heterozygosity, lack of SDHB expression, global DNA hypermethylation, and elevated succinate/fumarate ratio) in a 40-year-old woman with undifferentiated gastric spindle cell sarcoma that did not meet the diagnostic criteria for other mesenchymal tumors of the stomach, including GIST. These data reveal that the loss of SDH function can be involved in the pathogenesis of non-GIST sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Artificial intelligence (AI) that surpasses human ability in image recognition is expected to be applied in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopes. Accordingly, its research and development (R &D) is being actively conducted. With the development of endoscopic diagnosis, there is a shortage of specialists who can perform high-precision endoscopy. We will examine whether AI with excellent image recognition ability can overcome this problem.\\nSince 2016, papers on artificial intelligence using convolutional neural network (CNN in other word Deep Learning) have been published. CNN is generally capable of more accurate detection and classification than conventional machine learning. This is a review of papers using CNN in the gastrointestinal endoscopy area, along with the reasons why AI is required in clinical practice. We divided this review into four parts: stomach, esophagus, large intestine, and capsule endoscope (small intestine).\\nPotential applications for the AI include colorectal polyp detection and differentiation, gastric and esophageal cancer detection, and lesion detection in capsule endoscopy. The accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis will increase if the AI and endoscopist perform the endoscopy together. The prognostic potential of PD-L1 is currently unclear in gastric carcinomas, although the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have produced promising results in clinical trials.\\nWe explored the prognostic implications of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 514 consecutive surgically-resected gastric carcinomas. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, CD8, FOXP3, and PD-1, and molecular grouping by in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNAs and multiplex PCR for microsatellite instability (MSI) markers were performed. Additionally, to explore the function inherent to PD-L1, PD-L1-specific siRNA transfection, cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis assays were conducted in five gastric carcinoma cell lines.\\nPD-L1(+) tumor and immune cells were observed in 101 (20%) and 244 patients (47%), respectively. \"Tumoral PD-L1(+)/immune cell PD-L1(-)/CD8\\nThe prognostic impact of PD-L1 may depend on the tumor microenvironment, and statuses of EBV and MSI, although PD-L1 innately promotes cancer cell survival in cell-based assays. The combination of \"tumoral PD-L1/immune cell PD-L1/CD8 Suppression of risk factors including smoking, overdrinking and infections by human papilloma and hepatitis B and C viruses has been recommended for cancer prevention; however, identification of other environmental risk factors has not been enough. Besides the 2003 report that Kawasaki disease may be triggered by pollen exposure, 40 Japanese specific intractable diseases have recently been reported as \"pollen diseases,\" also potentially triggered by pollen exposure．Various human organs are affected by pollen exposure, leading to systemic vasculitis; autoimmune connective tissue diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases and intractable neuromuscular and bone diseases, suggesting the common effects of pollen exposure on fundamental functions of vital metabolism. In this context, cancer and malignant tumors may be another group of intractable diseases triggered by epigenetic pollen exposure. Thus, this study compared the number of newly registered patients with 24 types of cancer and airborne pollen levels measured from 1975 to 2015. We searched for statistical correlations with Bonferroni correction between the annual number of newly registered patients for all cancers or for each of lung, stomach, colorectal, pancreatic and breast cancers in the patient-registry year \"x\", and annual airborne pollen levels measured in the same year as \"x\", or 1-7 years prior to the year \"x\". The number of newly registered patients for lung, and pancreatic cancers in the patient-registry year \"x\" was highly correlated with airborne pollen levels measured 2 years prior to \"x\". That for breast cancer was correlated with pollen levels measured 2 and 5 years prior to \"x\". To our knowledge, this is the first rapid communication of the association between pollen levels and cancer incidence. Gallstone disease (GSD) has, for many years, remained a high-cost, socially significant public health problem. Over the past decade, a number of studies have been carried out-both in humans and in animal models-confirming the role of the microbiota in various sections of the gastrointestinal tract as a new link in the etiopathogenesis of GSD. The microbiome of bile correlates with the bacterial composition of saliva, and the microbiome of the biliary tract has a high similarity with the microbiota of the duodenum. Pathogenic microflora of the oral cavity, through mechanisms of immunomodulation, can affect the motility of the gallbladder and the expression of mucin genes ( The role of RecQ protein-like 5 (RECQL5) in gastric carcinoma (GC) is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of RECQL5 in human GC and its potential regulatory network via bioinformatics analysis.\\nBioinformatic analysis was performed using data in the Oncomine database, Kaplan- Meier Plotter online software, MethHC database, catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC), cbioportal database and String database. Then, we verified the association between RECQL5 expression and GC prognosis by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The independent prognostic factors were determined by Cox multivariate analysis.\\nIt was found that both the mRNA and protein expression levels of RECQL5 were downregulated in GC samples (P\\xa0<\\xa0.05). Low RECQL5 expression indicated a poor prognosis in GC patients and is the independent prognostic factors for GC. No correlation between RECQL5 mRNA and DNA methylation was found using the MethHC database. The analysis of the COSMIC database showed a high proportion of missense mutation in GC. The functional enrichment analysis predicted that RECQL5 plays a role in DNA repair and cellular responses to DNA damage stimulus. RECQL5 might be enriched in homologous recombination pathways and Fanconi anemia pathway. Bioinformatics analysis identified 5 genes, namely POLR2D, POLR2G, DXO, KIN, and EIF2D, that were significantly correlated with RECQL5.\\nThe low expression of RECQL5 predicts poor overall survival in GC. RECQL5 may be a novel tumor suppressor for patients with GC. To investigate the impact of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) on the postoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with colorectal cancer.\\nA total of 200 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery between January 2015 and November 2018 were enrolled in the study. They were divided into a traditional treatment group (n=100) and an ERAS group (n=100). The traditional treatment group underwent radical laparoscopic colorectal surgery, and the ERAS group underwent traditional treatment plus the ERAS protocol (preoperative improvement of glucose tolerance, unconventional indwelling stomach and urinary tubes, intraoperative body temperature management, fluid management, postoperative pain management, early oral feeding, and early activities). Clinical data were collected for all patients. NLR levels before and after surgery, and complications were compared between the two groups.\\nPostoperative NLR was significantly lower in the ERAS compared with the traditional treatment group. The incidence of complications, including anastomotic leakage, pulmonary infection, urinary tract infection, and cardiopulmonary dysfunction were also significantly lower in the ERAS group.\\nEnhanced recovery after surgery can reduce the increase in postoperative NLR and reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications, which results will be of clinical value. Colostomy via the intraperitoneal route is often performed during laparoscopic Hartmann\\'s operation or abdominoperineal resection. Internal hernia of the small intestine often occurs after colostomy. This report shows a rare case of internal hernia of the stomach associated with sigmoid colostomy after laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer.\\nThe patient was a 79-year-old woman with a sigmoid colostomy. Computed tomography scan showed a markedly distended stomach in the space between the lifted sigmoid colon and the lateral abdominal wall. Laparoscopy revealed that the body of the stomach had passed through a hernia orifice located between the lifted sigmoid colon and the left lateral abdominal wall. The dislocated stomach was restored to its normal position, and the lateral defect was closed with the lateral peritoneum and the lifted sigmoid colon laparoscopically.\\nInternal hernia associated with colostomy can lead to not only obstruction of the small intestine, but also obstruction of the stomach. We reported a successful case of the suture repair for the internal hernia of the stomach associated with colostomy. We previously reported the HERBIS-4A phase II trial comparing S-1 plus cisplatin (SP) with\\xa0capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) in chemotherapy-naïve patients with HER2-negative advanced gastric cancer (GC). We performed a pooled analysis of HERBIS-4A and HERBIS-2, the phase II trial comparing SP with XP in HER2-negative recurrent GC patients with a recurrence-free interval after S-1 adjuvant therapy of\\u2009≥\\u20096\\xa0months.\\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either SP [S-1 (40-60\\xa0mg twice daily for 21\\xa0days) plus cisplatin (60\\xa0mg/m\\nIn the pooled analysis, SP (n\\u2009=\\u200944-50) showed a longer progression-free survival [6.4 versus 5.1\\xa0months; hazard ratio (HR), 0.666; P\\u2009=\\u20090.062], overall survival (14.8 versus 10.6\\xa0months; HR, 0.695; P\\u2009=\\u20090.099), and time to treatment failure (4.6 versus 3.6\\xa0months; HR, 0.668; P\\u2009=\\u20090.045) as well as a higher disease control rate (86.4% versus 68.1%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.149) compared with XP (n\\u2009=\\u200947-51). A significant survival advantage for SP over XP was apparent in patients with a performance status of 0, a differentiated-type tumor histology, or a primary tumor localization to the upper portion of the stomach.\\nOur pooled analysis supports the use of SP in the first-line setting for patients with HER2-negative advanced or recurrent GC with a recurrence-free interval of\\u2009≥\\u20096\\xa0months.\\nThe HERBIS-2 trial was registered with UMIN-CTR as UMIN000006105. Pancreatoduodenectomy with resection of the portal vein or superior mesenteric vein confluence has been safely performed in patients with pancreatic head cancer associated with infiltration of the portal vein or superior mesenteric vein. In recent years, left-sided portal hypertension, a late postoperative complication, has received focus owing to increased long-term survival with advances in chemotherapy. Left-sided hypertension may sometimes cause fatal gastrointestinal bleeding because of the rupture of gastrointestinal varices. Here, we present a case of colonic varices caused by left-sided portal hypertension after pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein resection.\\nA 69-year-old man diagnosed with pancreatic head cancer was referred to our department for surgery after undergoing chemotherapy with nine courses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Computed tomography showed a mass 25\\u2009mm in diameter and in contact with the portal vein. He had undergone subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein resection. Four centimeters of the portal vein had been resected, and end-to-end anastomosis was performed without splenic vein reconstruction. We had to completely resect the right colic vein, accessary right colic vein, and middle colic vein due to tumor invasion. The pathological diagnosis was ypT3, ypN1a, ypM0, and ypStageIIB, and he was administered TS-1 as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Seven months after therapeutic radical surgery, he presented with melena with progressive anemia. Computed tomography revealed transverse colonic varices. He was offered interventional radiology. Trans-splenic arterial splenic venography showed that transverse colonic varices had developed as collateral circulation of the splenic vein and inferior mesenteric vein system. An embolic substance was injected into the transverse colonic varices, which halted the progression of the anemia caused by melena. Fifteen months after therapeutic radical surgery, local recurrence of the tumor occurred; he died 28\\u2009months after the surgery.\\nWhen subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein resection is performed without splenic vein reconstruction, colonic varices may result from left-sided portal hypertension. Interventional radiology is an effective treatment for gastrointestinal bleeding due to colonic varices, but it is important to be observant for colonic necrosis and new varices. The 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) of the digestive tract introduced a new category of tumors named well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors (NET G-3). These lesions show a number of mitosis, or a Ki-67 index higher than 20% with a well-differentiated morphology, therefore separating them from neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) which are poorly differentiated. It has become clear that NET G-3 show differences not only in morphology but also in genotype, clinical presentation, and treatment response. The incidence of digestive NET G-3 represents about one third of NEN G-3 with main tumor sites being the pancreas, the stomach and the colon. Treatment for NET G-3 is not yet standardized because of lack of data. In a non-metastatic setting, international guidelines recommend surgical resection, regardless of tumor grading. For metastatic lesion, chemotherapy is the main treatment with similar regimen as NET G-2. Sunitinib has also shown some positive results in a small sample of patients but this needs confirmation. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and immunotherapy could be future available treatments after ongoing studies. The goal of this review was to sum up the latest data on the epidemiology and management of digestive NET G-3. Overweight and obesity are regarded as world epidemics and are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Two new highly palatable extruded mixes based on rice and pea ( Siphonaxanthin has been known to possess inhibitory effects against obesity, inflammation, and angiogenesis. However, little information on its in vivo bioavailability and biotransformation is available. To assess the bioavailability and metabolism of siphonaxanthin, its absorption and accumulation were evaluated using intestinal Caco-2 cells and Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Siphonaxanthin was absorbed and exhibited non-uniform accumulation and distribution patterns in tissues of ICR mice. Notably, in addition to siphonaxanthin, three main compounds were detected following dietary administration of siphonaxanthin. Because the compounds showed changes on mass spectra compared with that of siphonaxanthin, they were presumed to be metabolites of siphonaxanthin in ICR mice. Siphonaxanthin mainly accumulated in stomach and small intestine, while putative metabolites of siphonaxanthin mainly accumulated in liver and adipose tissues. Furthermore, siphonaxanthin and its putative metabolites selectively accumulated in white adipose tissue (WAT), especially mesenteric WAT. These results provide useful evidence regarding the in vivo bioactivity of siphonaxanthin. In particular, the results regarding the specific accumulation of siphonaxanthin and its metabolites in WAT have important implications for understanding their anti-obesity effects and regulatory roles in lipid metabolism. Zanthoxylum nitidum (Roxb.) DC. (Z. nitidum), which is known in China as Liang-Mian-Zhen, is mainly distributed in southern China and is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is traditionally used for treating stomach ache, toothache, rheumatic arthralgia, traumatic injury and venomous snake bites. Additional medical applications include the treatment of inflammations, various types of cancer, bacterial and viral infections, gastric and oral ulcers and liver damage.\\nThis paper aims to offer up-to-date information on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicity of Z. nitidum. This review also discussed the perspectives for possible future research on Z. nitidum.\\nA comprehensive review was carried out on studies about Z. nitidum conducted in the past 60 years by using different resources, including Flora of China, Pharmacopoeia of the People\\'s Republic of China and academic databases.\\nAt present, more than 150 chemical constituents have been separated and identified from Z. nitidum, most of which include alkaloids. Biological activities, including anti-inflammation, analgesia, haemostasis, anticancer and antibacterial, were determined via in vitro and in vivo studies. The variations in the efficacy of Z. nitidum can be attributed to the biological activities of its natural products, especially alkaloids. Toxicity studies on Z. nitidum are relatively few, thus requiring further study.\\nThis article generalises the current research achievements related to Z. nitidum, which is an important medicinal material in China. Some traditional uses of Z. nitidum have been assessed by pharmacological studies. Unresolved problems remain, including molecular mechanisms underlying biological activities, pharmacokinetics, toxicology and therapeutic effect, which are still being studied and explored before Z. nitidum can be integrated into clinical medicine. Sentinel node navigation surgery reduces the extent of gastric and lymph node dissection, and may improve quality of life. The benefit and harm of laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery (LSNNS) for early gastric cancer is unknown. The SENORITA (SEntinel Node ORIented Tailored Approach) trial investigated the pathological and surgical outcomes of LSNNS compared with laparoscopic standard gastrectomy (LSG) with lymph node dissection.\\nThe SENORITA trial was an investigator-initiated, open-label, parallel-assigned, non-inferiority, multicentre RCT conducted in Korea. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival. The secondary endpoints, morbidity and mortality within 30\\u2009days of surgery, are reported in the present study.\\nA total of 580 patients were randomized to LSG (292) or LSNNS (288). Surgery was undertaken in 527 patients (LSG 269, LSNNS 258). LSNNS could be performed according to the protocol in 245 of 258 patients, and a sentinel node basin was detected in 237 (96·7 per cent) Stomach-preserving surgery was carried out in 210 of 258 patients (81·4 per cent). Postoperative complications occurred in 51 patients in the LSG group (19·0 per cent) and 40 (15·5 per cent) in the LSNNS group (P\\u2009=\\u20090·294). Complications with a Clavien-Dindo grade of III or higher occurred in 16 (5·9 per cent) and 13 (5·0 per cent) patients in the LSG and LSNNS groups respectively (P\\u2009=\\u20090·647).\\nThe rate and severity of complications following LSNNS for early gastric cancer are comparable to those after LSG with lymph node dissection. Registration number: NCT01804998 ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).\\nLa cirugía de navegación del ganglio centinela (sentinel node navigation surgery, SNNS) reduce la extensión de la resección gástrica y ganglionar, y puede mejorar la calidad de vida. Se desconoce el beneficio y el daño de la cirugía de navegación del ganglio centinela por vía laparoscópica (laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery, LSNNS) para el cáncer gástrico precoz. El ensayo clínico SENORITA investigó los resultados patológicos y quirúrgicos de LSNNS en comparación con la gastrectomía laparoscópica estándar (laparoscopic gastrectomy, LSG) con disección ganglionar (lymph node dissection, LND). MÉTODOS: El ensayo SENORITA fue un ensayo multicéntrico aleatorizado y controlado, iniciado por investigadores, abierto, con asignación a grupos paralelos y de no inferioridad llevado a cabo en Corea. El resultado primario fue la supervivencia libre de enfermedad a los 3 años. En el presente estudio, se describen los resultados secundarios correspondientes a morbilidad y mortalidad a los 30 días del postoperatorio.\\nUn total de 580 pacientes fueron aleatorizados a LG (n =\\u2009292) o LSNNS (n =\\u2009288). La cirugía se realizó en 527 pacientes (LG 269, LSNNS 258). LSNNS pudo ser realizada de acuerdo con el protocolo en 245 de 258 pacientes y en 237 de 245 pacientes (96,7%) se detectó un ganglio centinela. La cirugía con preservación del estómago se realizó en 210 de 258 pacientes (81,4%). Las complicaciones postoperatorias se presentaron en 51 pacientes del grupo LSG (19,0%) y en 40 pacientes (15,5%) del grupo LSNNS (P =\\u20090,294). Las complicaciones grado III o mayor de Clavien-Dindo se detectaron en 16 (5,9%) y 13 pacientes (5,0%) de los grupos LSG y LSNNS, respectivamente (P =\\u20090,647). CONCLUSIÓN: El porcentaje y la gravedad de las complicaciones tras LSNNS para cancer gástrico precoz son comparables a la LSG con LND. Most metastatic lung tumors display well-defined, round, multiple nodular shadows, whereas the presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography generally suggests non-malignant conditions. Here, we report an unusual case of pulmonary metastasis from gastric cancer in which diffuse ground-glass opacities were observed in all lung segments. A 59-year-old man with a 3-month history of worsening chest pain and shortness of breath was referred to the pulmonary clinic. Chest computed tomography revealed low attenuation areas, suggesting emphysema, along with diffuse ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs. A transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed signet-ring cell carcinoma infiltrating the alveolar septa. Immunohistochemical staining of the cancer cells was positive for CDX-2, cytokeratin 7, and cytokeratin 20, and negative for surfactant apoprotein-A, TTF-1, and Napsin A. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an ulcerative tumor in the stomach, and a biopsy from the tumor demonstrated malignant cells with similar morphology and immunophenotypes as those in the lungs. The final diagnosis was diffuse lung metastasis from gastric cancer. Our case shows that although multiple, well-defined nodules are typically considered to be the classic presentation of pulmonary metastasis, clinicians should also be aware of the possibility of pulmonary metastasis presenting as diffuse ground-glass opacities. To investigate the mechanism of Coptidis Rhizoma-Pinelliae Rhizoma in the treatment of gastric cancer based on syste-matic pharmacology and data mining. The chemical constituents of Coptidis Rhizoma and Pinelliae Rhizoma were obtained from Traditio-nal Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database(TCMSP) and Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry database of Chinese Academy of Sciences by data mining. Then the active ingredients were screened by ADME, and the targets of the active ingredients were predicted by chemometrics. Molecular docking and free energy analysis were used to verify and screen the targets, so as to obtain the therapeutic targets of Coptidis Rhizoma and Pinelliae Rhizoma for gastric cancer. The biological functions, diseases and related signal pathways corresponding to the targets were further analyzed, and then the multi-component, multi-target and multi-channel mechanism of Coptidis Rhizoma and Pinelliae Rhizoma for gastric cancer were elaborated. Finally, MTT, Scratch, Transwell and Western blot experiments were carried out to verify the inhibitory effect of Coptidis Rhizoma and Pinelliae Rhizoma on human gastric cancer cell line MKN-45. A total of 46 active ingredients of Coptidis Rhizoma and Pinelliae Rhizoma were screened, as well as 77 corresponding targets, 38 targets related to gastric cancer and its complications, top 8 related signaling pathways, and top 20 target molecular functions by GO analysis. Cell experiments also proved that Coptidis Rhizoma and Pinelliae Rhizoma could effectively inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration ability of gastric cancer cells and inhibit TGF-β1-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activation. Coptidis Rhizoma and Pinelliae Rhizoma drug pair has many active ingredients, which can regulate nervous and mental system, cell cycle, cell differentiation and metastasis, and enhance anti-inflammatory and immune functions, playing a synergistic anti-cancer role in gastric cancer and its complications and providing new ideas for the follow-up clinical treatment of gastric cancer. The tight junction molecule Claudin 18.2 is selectively expressed in healthy and malignant gastric epithelial tissue and is a promising therapy target for high Claudin 18.2 expressing adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction and stomach (AEG/S).\\nThis study analyzed the prevalence, characteristics and prognostic impact of Claudin 18.2 expression in primary tumor, lymph node and distant metastasis in a large Caucasian AGE/S cohort with 414 patients.\\nClaudin 18.2 was highly expressed in 17.1% of primary tumors, 26.7% of lymph node metastasis and 16.7% of distant metastasis. High Claudin 18.2 expression in lymph node metastasis and primary tumors correlated significantly (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). High expression of Claudin 18.2 was neither associated with histomorphogical subtype, or tumor state, nor with overall survival.\\nIn Caucasian AEG/S patients, 17.1% appeared to be eligible for an anti-Claudin 18.2 therapy. Claudin 18.2 expression itself has no impact on prognosis and is not related to any tumor subtype. We encountered a case of marginal ulcer in the jejunum after distal gastrectomy with jejunal pouch interposition. However, it has not been reported and not confirmed the treatment. We chose truncal vagotomy, considering reduced morbidity and postoperative complications.\\nA case was a 69-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital with melena. She had received curative distal gastrectomy with a 15-cm jejunal pouch reconstruction for early gastric cancer. Marginal ulcer in the jejunal pouch was detected by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. She was given medication; however, she repeated hospitalization for melena and abdominal pain. Therefore, we decided to perform surgery, and truncal vagotomy was performed. The patient\\'s postoperative course was uneventful and was discharged on the 22nd postoperative day. Symptoms such as abdominal pain and melena were improved after truncal vagotomy.\\nWe presented a case with a complicated peptic ulcer after distal gastrectomy with reconstruction by jejunal pouch interposition, which was successfully treated by truncal vagotomy, a surgical acid-reducing procedure which does not require resection of remnant stomach. The increasing prevalence of morbid obesity in the United States has been accompanied by a concomitant rise in bariatric surgery to help combat the epidemic. The relationship between obesity and certain cancers, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, is well established. The need for minimally invasive techniques to treat esophageal cancer in patients with previous bariatric surgery is growing and can present a unique surgical challenge. This report presents the case of a 55-year-old woman with a previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who was shown by endoscopy to have an invasive adenocarcinoma located in the distal thoracic esophagus. This necessitated an excision of the thoracic esophagus and the gastric pouch. A laparoscopic and thoracoscopic Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy was performed for this complex patient with esophageal adenocarcinoma. The remnant stomach was fashioned into a gastric conduit using a 60-mm linear stapler with a staple height of 4.1 mm (Echelon, Ethicon Endosurgery, Blue Ash, OH). The reconstruction was performed using a 25-mm Orvil (Covidien, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and EEA 25-mm DST XL (Covidien) to create a circular stapled thoracic esophagogastric anastomosis. A feeding jejunostomy was placed in the residual 130-cm Roux limb. The study demonstrated that minimally invasive esophagectomy is safe and technically feasible with appropriate oncologic outcomes for patients with previous gastric bypass. This cohort of patients will undoubtedly continue to grow in the coming years. In local staging of gastric adenocarcinoma CT is the modality of choice. Less frequently used in a few selected patients is echo-endoscopy. Aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of hydro-multidetector-computed tomography (hydro-MDCT) in the evaluation of gastric adenocarcinomas with subsequent surgical and histopathological correlation to select cases for echo-endoscopy.\\nA total of 65 patients with gastric adenocarcinomas, diagnosed by endoscopy and biopsy, underwent contrast-enhanced hydro-MDCT with subsequent tumor, nodes, metastases (TNM) classification. The distension of the gastric lumen was obtained after the oral administration of 500 ml of water.\\nHydro-MDCT always detected gastric cancer and in 49/65 patients the assessment of T-parameter was identical to the histopathological results (accuracy: 75%). We found overstaging in 12 and understaging in 4 cases. N-parameter with MDCT was in agreement with histo-pathology in 69%of patients; in metastatic disease hydro-MDCT had an accuracy of 99%. Hydro-MDCT has proven to be a reliable diagnostic technique in evaluating gastric cancer T3-T4 stages in comparison to T1 and T2: in defining T2-stage we found the highest number of errors (37%).\\nHydro-MDCT is a reliable technique in the preoperative staging of gastric adenocarcinoma. Echo-endoscopy could be particularly useful in doubtful cases to evaluate the muscularis propria infiltration (T2 vs. T3) and characterize the peri-gastric lymph nodes. Rta, a transactivator of Epstein-Barr virus, is associated with progression of nasopharyngel carcinoma (NPC); however, its mechanism of contribution to the pathogenesis of NPC remains unclear. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a tumor promoter, is detected in NPC. This in vitro study examined whether and how Rta promotes NPC progression by up-regulating IL-6.\\nSemiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA, immunoblotting assays, reporter gene assays, and transwell migration assays were performed.\\nIn NPC cells, Rta up-regulated IL-6 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, and the Rta\\'s C-terminus was essential for promoter activation and expression of IL-6. The induction of IL-6 by Rta also required activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and activator protein-1. Furthermore, IL-6 secreted from Rta-expressing NPC cells promoted migration of Rta-negative NPC cells by activating IL-6 receptor/Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway.\\nRta contributes to progression of NPC cells through induction of IL-6 in vitro. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an anticancer drug commonly used to treat gastric cancer; however, continuous 5-FU chemotherapy causes drug resistance.\\nWe established five sublines of 5-FU-resistant AGS gastric cancer cells to investigate changes that may have occurred in the development of 5-FU resistance. Drug resistance to other chemotherapeutic reagents, proliferation, cell-cycle changes, and wound healing ability were assessed for each subline.\\nRetarded cell growth, G\\nOur data support the notion that G We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of gastric carcinoma with high excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) expression and the prognostic value of ERCC1 expression.\\nERCC1 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 309 surgically resected gastric carcinoma specimens using a tissue microarray. Cancer-related survival was analysed using competing risk analysis.\\nCompared to ERCC1-low gastric carcinomas, ERCC1-high gastric carcinomas showed less local invasion (p=0.0013), lower N stage (p=0.0302), earlier pTNM stage (p=0.0003), and less frequent recurrence (p=0002). Patients with ERCC1-high gastric carcinoma showed lower cumulative incidence function estimate of cancer-related death [3.37; 95% confidence intervaI (CI)=0.89-8.75] than did those with ERCC1-low gastric carcinoma (17.12; 95% CI=12.24-22.69; p-value by Gray\\'s test=0.0012). Adjusted proportional sub-distribution hazard ratio for cancer-related death in the patients with ERCC1-high tumour was 0.272 (95% CI=0.084-0.878; p=0.0295).\\nHigh ERCC1 expression may be an independent positive prognostic marker for gastric carcinoma. Ultrasonically activated surgical devices (USADs) have become indispensable instruments for gastrointestinal surgery. In this study, we investigated the oncological safety of the use of USADs.\\nWe harvested and cultivated the splashes and mist scattered from an USAD when cutting MKN45-derived cancer nodules. Seven days later, we observed viable cancer cells and the total number of cells was counted. The histopathology of the nodules cut by the USAD was also examined.\\nThe existence of viable cancer cells was confirmed by ex vivo cell culture. The number of viable cancer cells was reduced by slow grasping of the USAD. The surface of cancerous tissue cut by the USAD was partially heat-denatured, however, there were some parts in which cancerous tissue was exposed on the surface.\\nSurgeons should recognize the possibility that cancer cells may be scattered by USAD use. Cutaneous metastases are rare. They usually present as nodules or tumors. Diagnosis is based on histopathological examination and prognosis is unfavorable. This report describes the case of a female patient, 72 years old, with surgically treated gastric antrum adenocarcinoma. Pathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells. It evolved with bone involvement, lymph node enlargement in the inguinal region, and skin infiltration in the lower limbs, abdomen, and root of the upper limbs. Skin biopsy demonstrated signet ring carcinoma embolizing the dermal and hypodermic vessels and invasion of adipose tissue, confirming carcinomatous lymphangitis. Carcinomatous lymphangitis is the cutaneous and subcutaneous lymphatic invasion by tumor cells. Cutaneous metastasis is relatively uncommon and presents mainly as cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules, and more rarely as inflammatory lesions. The present case reports carcinomatous lymphangitis associated with gastric cancer. Stomach cancer (SC) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC.\\nSC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed. The miRNAs (miRanda, miRTarget2, PicTar, PITA and TargetScan databases), SC-related miRNAs (HMDD and miR2Disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, dbSNP database), and SC-related SNPs (ClinVar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases. Moreover, gene_disease (OMIM and GAD databases), copy number variation (CNV, DGV database), methylation (PubMeth database), drug (WebGestalt database), and transcription factor (TF, TRANSFAC database) analyses were performed for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).\\nIn total, 9990 SC-related genes (including 8347 up-regulated genes and 1643 down-regulated genes) were identified, among which, 65 genes were further confirmed as SC-related genes by performing enrichment analysis. Besides this, 457 miRNAs, 20 SC-related miRNAs, 1570 SNPs, 108 SC-related SNPs, 419 TFs, 44,605 CNVs, 3404 drug-associated genes, 63 genes with methylation, and KM survival curves of 20,264 genes were obtained. By integrating these datasets, an integrated database of stomach cancer, designated as SCDb, (available at http://www.stomachcancerdb.org/) was established.\\nAs a comprehensive resource for human SC, SCDb database will be very useful for performing SC-related research in future, and will thus promote the understanding of the pathogenesis of SC. Numerous studies conducted over the past 30\\u2009years have pointed to the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in gastric cancer samples. This study was aimed to provide a meta-analytic review of the prevalence of EBV in gastric cancer patients, and to clarify the relationship between EBV infection and gastric cancer.\\nA literature search was performed electronically using online databases for English language publications until July 1, 2019. The pooled EBV prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model. To determine the association between EBV and gastric cancer, pooled odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI were computed for case-control studies. Two separate analyses were performed on data from case-control studies with matched and non-match pairs designs to calculate the pooled estimates of ORs.\\nThe pooled prevalence of EBV in 20,361 gastric cancer patients was 8.77% (95% CI: 7.73-9.92%; I\\nEBV infection is associated with more than 18 times increase the risk of gastric cancer. Although the prevalence of EBV was higher in male patients than in female patients with gastric cancer, women are more likely than men to develop EBV-associated gastric cancer. Our findings showed that using tumor-adjacent normal tissues as the control group provides more robust and accurate results regarding the relationship between EBV infection and gastric cancer. Pancreatic heterotopia is a well-described entity occurring at multiple abdominal sites, most commonly the stomach and small intestine. They can develop similar disease processes as the pancreas ranging from acute pancreatitis, cyst formation, or neoplasms, most commonly ductal adenocarcinoma. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) arising in pancreatic heterotopias are exceedingly rare with only 3 prior published cases. In this article, we describe the first reported case of a NET arising in a jejunal pancreatic heterotopia in a 59-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain and diarrhea. The submucosal tumor was composed of a well-differentiated NET (World Health Organization grade 1) directly intermixed with a heterotopic pancreas consisting of acinar cells, islet cells, and ducts. This case illustrates that NETs can occur in association with pancreatic heterotopias at any site. Also, the importance for pathologists to recognize that pancreatic heterotopias can give rise to a variety of neoplasms and is not limited to ductal adenocarcinoma. None  A 28-year-old man was admitted to the first medical center of Chinese People\\'s Liberation Army General Hospital because of multiple myalgia and intramuscular nodules for more than 2 months. The patient complained of dysphagia, fever and weight loss 2 months ago. Magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy revealed nodular fasciitis. Inflammatory indicators including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count and fibrinogen were slightly elevated. Urine occult blood was positive. Abdominal ultrasound revealed left hydronephrosis. Because nodular fasciitis could not explain the whole situation, a needle biopsy of intramuscular nodules was performed. Pathological examination revealed intramuscular metastatic adenocarcinoma with poor differentiation. Gastric endoscope and positron emission tomography-computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma with extensive metastases of esophagus, lymph nodes, muscles, ureter and bone. Although chemotherapy was given, the patient died of disease progression six months later.\\n患者男性，28岁。因多发肌肉疼痛伴肌内结节2月余入院。患者吞咽困难、发热、消瘦，外院病理及磁共振成像均提示结节性筋膜炎可能。入院后查C反应蛋白11 mg/L，红细胞沉降率24 mm/1h，血小板计数388×10(9)/L，血浆纤维蛋白原4.59 g/L，尿潜血阳性，腹部超声示左肾积水。考虑结节性筋膜炎不能解释疾病全貌，再次行肌内结节穿刺活检，病理及免疫组化提示肌间转移性低分化腺癌。患者至肿瘤医院完善胃镜及正电子发射断层成像检查，最终诊断为胃低分化腺癌Ⅳ期（食管、淋巴结、肌肉、输尿管、骨多发转移），接受化疗，半年后死亡。. The Wnt signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved, regulating both embryonic development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. Wnt signaling controls several fundamental cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and stemness. It therefore plays an important role in the epithelial homeostasis and regeneration of the gastrointestinal tract. Often, both hypo- or hyper-activation of the pathway due to genetic, epigenetic, or receptor/ligand alterations are seen in many solid cancers, such as breast, colorectal, gastric, and prostate. Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth commonest cause of cancer worldwide and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death annually. Although the number of new diagnoses has declined over recent decades, prognosis remains poor, with only 15% surviving to five years. Geographical differences in clinicopathological features are also apparent, with epidemiological and genetic studies revealing GC to be a highly heterogeneous disease with phenotypic diversity as a result of etiological factors. The molecular heterogeneity associated with GC dictates that a single \\'one size fits all\\' approach to management is unlikely to be successful. Wnt pathway dysregulation has been observed in approximately 50% of GC tumors and may offer a novel therapeutic target for patients who would otherwise have a poor outcome. This mini review will highlight some recent discoveries involving Wnt signaling in GC.  TAS-102 is a preconstituted drug combination comprising an oral fluoropyrimidine (trifluridine, TFT) and a potent inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylase (tipiracil hydrochloride, TPI). TFT/TPI has recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval also for the treatment of gastric cancer after at least two lines of chemotherapy. The approval was based on a large phase 3 trial (TAGS), in which TAS-102 showed a 31 % decrease in the risk of death compared with placebo. Here, we review the pharmacological properties, clinical development and potential future directions of TAS-102 in gastric cancer. Helicobacter\\xa0pylori is the most infectious human pathogen that causes gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancer. H.\\xa0pylori DNA polymerase I (HpPol I) is found to be essential for the viability of H.\\xa0pylori, but its intrinsic property and attribution to the H.\\xa0pylori DNA replication remain unclear. HpPol I contains a 5\\'→3\\' exonuclease (5\\'-Exo) and DNA polymerase (Pol) domain, respectively, but lacks a 3\\'→5\\' exonuclease, or error proofreading activity. In this study, we characterized the 5\\'-Exo and Pol functions of HpPol I and found that HpPol I is a multifunctional protein displaying DNA nick translation, strand-displacement synthesis, RNase H-like, structure-specific endonuclease and exonuclease activities. In the in\\xa0vitro DNA replication assay, we further demonstrated that the 5\\'-Exo and Pol domains of HpPol I can cooperate to fill in the DNA gap, remove the unwanted RNA primer from a RNA/DNA hybrid and create a ligatable nick for the DNA ligase A of H.\\xa0pylori to restore the normal duplex DNA. Altogether, our study suggests that the two catalytic domains of HpPol I may synergistically play an important role in the maturation of Okazaki fragments during the lagging-strand DNA synthesis in H.\\xa0pylori. Like the functions of DNA polymerase I in Escherichia\\xa0coli, HpPol I may involve in both DNA replication and repair in H.\\xa0pylori. Metastases to the subcutaneous scrotum are extremely rare. Here, we report a 78-year-old man who presented with pain to the scrotum and inguinal area. Two years ago, he underwent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The pain was attributed to increased scrotal wall thickness. Incisional biopsy of the thickened scrotal wall revealed diffused infiltration of the subcutaneous tissue by islands of scirrhous type malignant cells. Moreover, immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumor cells were positive for CK7, CK20, and CDX-2. These features suggested a metastatic adenocarcinoma of upper gastrointestinal origin. Although there were no visceral metastases, the tumor cells were too widely spread to be dissected curatively. Palliative chemotherapy with tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil (S-1) was restarted, and local pain was subsequently ameliorated. Since scrotal metastasis is unlikely to occur it is difficult to diagnose. Therefore, in patients with groin discomfort or swelling and a history of gastric cancer, metastatic adenocarcinoma should be included in the differential diagnosis for early detection of a tumor. Despite a need for assessment of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) skills in order to track progress and determine competence, there is no structured measure of assessing competency in ESD performance. The present study aims to develop and examine validity evidence for an assessment tool to evaluate the recorded performance of ESD for gastric neoplasms.\\nThe ESD video assessment tool (EVAT) was systematically developed by ESD experienced endoscopists. The EVAT consists of a 25-item global rating scale and 3-item checklist to assess competencies required to perform ESD. Five unedited videos were each evaluated by 2-blinded experienced ESD endoscopists to assess inter-rater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Seventeen unedited videos in total were rated by 3 blinded experienced ESD endoscopists. Validity evidence for relationship to other variables was examined by comparing scores of inexperienced (fellows) and experienced endoscopists (attending staff), and by evaluating the relationship between the EVAT scores and ESD case experience. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach\\'s alpha.\\nThe inter-rater reliability for the total score was high at 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.99). The total score [median, interquartile range (IQR)] was significantly different between the inexperienced (71, 63-77) and experienced group (95, 91-97) (P\\u2009=\\u20090.005). The total scores demonstrated high correlation with the number of ESD cases (Spearman\\'s ρ\\u2009=\\u20090.79, P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). The internal consistency was 0.97.\\nThis study provides preliminary validity evidence for the assessment of video-recorded ESD performances for gastric neoplasms using EVAT. Despite the comparable results between ESD and gastrectomy reported in multiple Asiatic studies, limited data are currently present on the long-term efficacy of ESD for EGC in Western countries. The aim of this study was to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of the endoscopic submucosal dissection and surgery for non-diffuse early gastric cancer treatment in a Western cohort of patients.\\nAll patients with a diagnosis of intestinal type EGC located in the middle and lower third of the stomach from 2005 to 2015 were enrolled in the study. All patients completed a 5-year follow-up. Patients were divided according to the procedure performed (ESD/subtotal gastrectomy). The two groups were matched for age, gender, ASA score, tumor dimension, and grade of infiltration (mucosa/submucosa).\\nAfter matching, 84 patients (42 per group) were included in the analysis. Peri-procedural morbidity rate was 7.1% and no difference was observed between the two groups (4.8% vs 9.5% for ESD and STG groups, respectively; p\\u2009=\\u20090.3). Similar results in terms of 5-year OS and DFS were observed for ESD and STG (77.7% vs 71.8% ; p\\u2009=\\u20090.78 and 74.9% vs 72% ; p\\u2009=\\u20090.7, respectively). At the multivariate analysis, ASA3 score was recognized as the only negative predictor factor for the 5-year OS (OR 6.2; 95% CI 2.2-16.8; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Regarding the DFS, both ASA3 score (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.7-10.9; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and submucosal infiltration(OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.2-22.4 ; p\\u2009=\\u20090.02) were identified as independent risk factors for a worse outcome.\\nOur results confirm the safety and feasibility ESD for EGC treatment in a Western setting. In addition, this is one of the few reports showing comparable results both in terms of short- and long-term outcomes between ESD and surgery for intestinal type ECG treatment in Western countries.  Application of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for treating undifferentiated-type early gastric cancers (EGCs) remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to compare long-term outcomes of ESD with those of surgery for patients with undifferentiated-type EGCs by a retrospective study.We retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent curative ESD or gastrectomy for undifferentiated-type EGCs between 2010 and 2017. Gastric cancers were undifferentiated-type adenocarcinoma without ulceration confined to the mucosal layer and 2\\u200acm or smaller in size. Demographics, complications, recurrence cancer rates, and survival data were collected and compared.Forty patients who underwent curative ESD and 52 patients who underwent surgery were included. The median follow-up duration was 74.6 months. There was no significant difference of metachronous gastric cancer rate (5.0% vs 3.8%, P\\u200a=\\u200a.75) or total cancer recurrence rate (10.0% vs 3.8%, P\\u200a=\\u200a.33) between the 2 groups. The 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, recurrence-free survival rates did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (P\\u200a=\\u200a.72, .26, .27 respectively). There were no gastric cancer-related deaths in either group.Long-term outcomes after curative ESD for undifferentiated-type EGCs that met the expanded indication were comparable to that achieved with surgery. ESD without additional surgery is an acceptable choice to treat undifferentiated-type EGCs that meet the curative criteria. We explored the potential of combining carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and salivary mRNAs for gastric cancer (GC) detection.This study included 2 phases of study: a biomarker discovery phase and an independent validation phase. In the discovery phase, we measured CEA levels in blood samples and expression level of messenger RNAs (SPINK7, PPL, SEMA4B, SMAD4) in saliva samples of 140 GC patients and 140 healthy controls. We evaluated the clinical performance of each biomarker and developed a predictive model using machine-learning algorithm to differentiate GC patients and healthy controls.Our biomarker panel successfully discriminated GC patients from healthy controls with both high sensitivity (0.94) and high specificity (0.91). We next applied our biomarker panel in the independent validation phase, in which we recruited a new patient cohort of 60 GC patients and 60 healthy controls. Using our biomarker panel, the GC patients were discriminated from healthy controls in the validation phase, with sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.87.A combination of blood CEA and salivary messenger RNA could be a promising approach to detect GC. Patients with esophageal cancer suffer from anxiety in the perioperative period surrounding esophagectomy; this may increase the risk of postoperative complications. In particular, postoperative aspiration pneumonia carries a high risk of hospital mortality. Bukuryoingohangekobokuto (BRIHK) is a traditional Japanese medicine formula used to treat anxiety, the feeling of a foreign body in the esophagus, and water brash. We hypothesize that BRIHK might be effective for both anxiety and water brash in perioperative patients with esophageal cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BRIHK compared to a placebo for anxiety and water brash in perioperative esophageal cancer patients.\\nThis will be a single-center, single blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. Twenty-four patients with esophageal cancer undergoing radical resection surgery will be registered to participate, then randomly and blindly assigned to the BRIHK treatment group or control group. Patients will be administered BRIHK or the placebo from 2 weeks before to 6 weeks after surgery. Primary outcome measures will be anxiety and depression (assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and water brash (assessed using the 10-item Eating Assessment Tool, Esophagus and Stomach Surgery Symptom Scale, and videofluoroscopy swallowing measurement). Incidences of aspiration pneumonia will be noted and abdominal gas volume, inflammatory markers, and nutrition status will be evaluated.\\nThis investigative study will provide clinical evidence of BRIHK administration for anxiety and water brash, which might improve mental distress and reduce postoperative mortality.\\nThe protocol and progress are registered on the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCT s021190001) and University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000031330). The protocol was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare certified clinical research review board, Tohoku University (CRB2180001). Immune checkpoint inhibitors including nivolumab, an antibody against programmed death-1, have been increasingly introduced in various cancer treatment regimens, and are reported to be associated with immune-related adverse events. Nivolumab-induced renal injury is generally caused by acute interstitial nephritis and is managed by drug discontinuation and steroid therapy. Although this agent can infrequently induce glomerulonephritis, the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategy remain undetermined.\\nA 78-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer with portal thrombosis. First- and second-line chemotherapies were ineffective; thus, nivolumab monotherapy was initiated. Although it effectively prevented tumor growth, proteinuria and microhematuria appeared 2 months later. Despite drug discontinuation, serum creatinine progressively increased from 0.72 to 1.45\\u200amg/dL. Renal biopsy revealed mesangial IgA and C3 deposition in immunofluorescence analysis and mesangial proliferation with crescent formation in light microscopy.\\nThe patient was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. Based on the temporal relationship between the nivolumab therapy and abnormal urinalysis, IgA nephropathy was considered to have been induced by nivolumab.\\nA moderate dose (0.6\\u200amg/kg/day) of prednisolone was orally administrated, with tapering biweekly.\\nSteroid therapy stabilized his serum creatinine levels and markedly reduced proteinuria. However, bacterial pneumonia substantially impaired his performance status; thus, nivolumab could not be restarted despite tumor regrowth.\\nIgA nephropathy should be recognized as an uncommon renal adverse event during nivolumab therapy. After drug discontinuation, nivolumab-induced IgA nephropathy is likely to respond to moderate doses of steroid therapy with early tapering. However, more evidence is needed to determine whether nivolumab can be safely restarted during or after steroid therapy. To investigate the different expression of epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in gastric cancer based on tumor locations and its impact on patients survival.Gastric cancer is heterogeneous disease, recent years have established a molecular classification and described distribution of molecular subtypes in stomach. However, the difference of EGFR and HER-2 expression among tumor location is still unknown.Between January 2010 and August 2014, 2477 consecutive patients with gastric cancer were treated in our surgery department. The tumor locations were classified into 4 groups: cardia, fundus, corpus, and antrum. Based on tumor locations, the clinicopathologic characteristics, EGFR and HER-2 expression, and follow-up data were analyzed by univariant analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis retrospectively.There were difference of gender, age, Borrmann type, pathological type, differentiation, T-stage, tumor size, gastrectomy method, and complications among the locations. The positive rate of EGFR expression in fundus was 18.18%, which was lower than cardia (46.21%), corpus (43.62%), and antrum (48.83%) (P\\u200a<\\u200a.001). The 5-year survival rate in EGFR positive patients was 50.8%, which was significantly lower than EGFR negative patients (64.0%, P\\u200a=\\u200a.021). The positive rate of HER-2 expression in cardia was 48.15%, which was significantly higher than fundus (37.5%), corpus (35.45%), and antrum (38.54%) (P\\u200a=\\u200a.009), but HER-2 expression did not correlate with 5-year survive (P\\u200a=\\u200a.548).Our results suggest that there exist difference of EGFR and HER-2 expression based on tumor locations, and the distribution of EGFR impact on patients survival. Emphasizing the role of EGFR and HER-2 in the context of location contribute to make appropriate treatment strategy and improve prognosis of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer (GC) continues to be 1 of the malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although the improvements in targeted inhibitor therapy have promoted survival, the first choice for GC patients is still surgery. However, prolonged surgery may tire surgeons and affect surgical outcomes.To detect whether different time-of-day radical gastrectomy influenced short-term and long-term surgical outcomes.This study included 117 patients between 2008 and 2012 who underwent a radical gastrectomy. These patients were grouped into the morning (before 13:00) and afternoon (after 13:00) groups or divided into 2 groups according to the median operation start time (before or after 11:23). Then, the relevant influence of the surgical start time was analyzed.The morning group (before 13:00) and the front median group (before 11:23) showed longer operative time (P\\u200a=\\u200a.008 and P\\u200a=\\u200a.016, respectively), lower estimated blood loss (P\\u200a<\\u200a.001 and P\\u200a=\\u200a.158, respectively), and longer time before resuming oral intake (P\\u200a<\\u200a.001 and P\\u200a<\\u200a.173, respectively) than the afternoon group (after 13:00) or latter median group (after 11:23). Starting the operation in the morning had no effect on the rate of postoperative complications. The operation start time had no significant influence on the overall survival of patients who underwent a radical gastrectomy. However, in subgroup analysis, patients who underwent a distal gastrectomy faced poor prognosis when their surgery started after 13:00 (P\\u200a=\\u200a.030).The results suggest that the operation start time might be an indicator of total operative time, estimated blood loss, and the time to resuming oral intake. The operation start time may also influence the prognosis of radical gastrectomy in patients with GC. Self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement is widely used for relieving symptoms in malignant gastric outlet obstruction (MGOO). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple gastroduodenal stent placement using the stent-in-stent technique and to identify factors predictive of stent patency.We retrospectively analyzed data from 170 patients with GOO receiving SEMS using the stent-in-stent technique between July 2006 and July 2018. Of these, 90 had been treated with SEMS placement for MGOO. Technical and clinical success rates were evaluated. Clinical outcomes and predictors of stent patency were also analyzed.Second SEMS placement was used in 34.4% of cases and 9.7% were treated with third SEMS placement because of prior stent dysfunction. Median stent patency time was 15.7 weeks for the first SEMS, 10.4 weeks for the second, and 11.3 weeks for the third. The technical and clinical success rates were 100% and 97.8% for the first SEMS, 100% and 90.3% for the second, respectively, and both 100% for the third. Multivariable analysis showed that use of covered SEMS and chemotherapy after first and second SEMS placement was significant predictors of stent patency. Serious complications such as bleeding or perforation did not occur in any patient.Second and third gastroduodenal SEMS placement using the stent-in-stent technique is safe and effective for management of first stent dysfunction in MGOO. Stent patency is significantly associated with the use of covered SEMS and chemotherapy after SEMS placement. Helicobacter pylori causes a Gram-negative bacterial infection that can increase the risk of gastric cancer. Consequently, meticulous prevention of an H. pylori infection is significant for averting gastric cancer in humans. Nobiletin, an important dietary polymethoxylated flavonoid in citrus fruits, possesses multidimensional pharmaceutical properties, including its ability to act as an anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, cardiovascularly defensive, neuroprotective, and antimetabolic agent. Our study evaluates the role of nobiletin in inflammation-mediated gastric carcinogenic signaling of H. pylori-arbitrated coculture in the human gastric epithelial (GES)-1 cell line. Our results show that the culture system of H. pylori-tainted GES-1 cells demonstrates maximum fabrication of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mediating DNA injury and augmenting nuclear fragmentations. Treatment with nobiletin reduces ROS levels and apoptotic morphological changes by dual staining and decreases levels of lipid peroxides and glutathione content in H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/phosphatase and tensin homolog signaling have been implicated to affect cell endurance, inflammation, proliferation, and carcinogenic activity in gastric GES-1 cells. We find that nobiletin strongly impedes tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2, PI3K, AKT, and mitogen-activated protein kinase molecules, including p38, extracellular receptor kinase 1, and c-Jun amino-terminal expression in H. pylori-infected GES-1 cells. We conclude that nobiletin potentially impedes H. pylori infection and its related activation, likely preventing H. pylori infection-mediated gastric cancer. The relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and nonhepatocellular cancers remains inconclusive. This large case-control study aimed to assess the associations between HBV infection status and multiple cancers. Cases (n = 50\\u2009392) and controls (n = 11\\u2009361) were consecutively recruited from 2008 to 2016 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Multivariable adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using logistic regression by adjusting age and gender. A meta-analysis based on published studies was also performed to verify the associations. Of these, 12.1% of cases and 5.5% of controls were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive. We observed significant associations between HBsAg seropositivity and esophagus cancer (aOR [95% CI] = 1.32 [1.13-1.54]), stomach cancer (1.46 [1.30-1.65]), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 39.11 [35.08-43.59]), intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma (ICC and ECC; 3.83 [2.58-5.67] and 1.72 [1.28-2.31]), pancreatic cancer (PaC; 1.37 [1.13-1.65]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 1.88 [1.61-2.20]) and leukemia (11.48 [4.05-32.56]). Additionally, compared to participants with HBsAg-/anti-HBs-/anti-HBc-, participants with HBsAg-/anti-HBs-/anti-HBc+, indicating past HBV-infected, had an increased risk of esophagus cancer (aOR [95% CI] =\\u20091.46 [1.24-1.73]), stomach cancer (1.20 [1.04-1.39]), HCC (4.80 [3.95-5.84]) and leukemia (15.62 [2.05-119.17]). Then the overall meta-analysis also verified that HBsAg seropositivity was significantly associated with stomach cancer (OR [95% CI] =\\u20091.23 [1.14-1.33]), ICC (4.05 [2.78-5.90]), ECC (1.73 [1.30-2.30]), PaC (1.26 [1.09-1.46]), NHL (1.95 [1.55-2.44]) and leukemia (1.54 [1.26-1.88]). In conclusion, both our case-control study and meta-analysis confirmed the significant association of HBsAg seropositivity with stomach cancer, ICC, ECC, PaC, NHL and leukemia. Of note, our findings also suggested that the risk of stomach cancer elevated for people whoever exposed to HBV.  Gastric Schwannomas are rare benign slow-growing tumors and warrant treatment/resection only when symptomatic. Watchful waiting is recommended for incidental or asymptomatic schwannomas. Screening and surveillance for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers by endoscope guided biopsy is invasive, time consuming, and has the potential for sampling error. Tissue endogenous fluorescence spectra contain biochemical and physiological information, which may enable real-time, objective diagnosis. We first briefly reviewed optical biopsy modalities for GI cancer diagnosis with a focus on fluorescence-based techniques. In an  The conventional guidelines to obtain a safe proximal resection margin (PRM) of 5-6 cm during advanced gastric cancer (AGC) surgery are still applied by many surgeons across the world. Several recent studies have raised questions regarding the need for such extensive resection, but without reaching consensus. This study was designed to prove that the PRM distance does not affect the prognosis of patients who undergo gastrectomy for AGC.\\nTo investigate the influence of the PRM distance on the prognosis of patients who underwent gastrectomy for AGC.\\nElectronic medical records of 1518 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for AGC between June 2004 and December 2007 at Asan Medical Center, a tertiary care center in Korea, were reviewed retrospectively for the study. The demographics and clinicopathologic outcomes were compared between patients who underwent surgery with different PRM distances using one-way ANOVA and Fisher\\'s exact test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The influence of PRM on recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard analysis.\\nThe median PRM distance was 4.8 cm and 3.5 cm in the distal gastrectomy (DG) and total gastrectomy (TG) groups, respectively. Patient cohorts in the DG and TG groups were subdivided into different groups according to the PRM distance; ≤ 1.0 cm, 1.1-3.0 cm, 3.1-5.0 cm and > 5.0 cm. The DG and TG groups showed no statistical difference in recurrence rate (23.5% \\nThe distance of PRM is not a prognostic factor for patients who undergo curative gastrectomy for AGC. Uruguay is the south American country which has the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates. The National Cancer Registry collects data on cancer cases nationwide since 1989 and has reached high quality standards in the last decades. This is the first report on incidence trends.\\nData from the National Cancer Registry of all new cases of invasive cancer from twelve sites diagnosed in 2002-2015 was analyzed. Age-standardized rates were calculated. Trends of incidence rates were analyzed using joinpoint regression models.\\nFor both, men and women, incidence rates trends for all cancer sites, colo-rectal and bladder cancer remained stable. Esophageal and gastric cancers descended while thyroid and kidney cancer incidence increased. In men lung cancer decreased; testicular cancer increased, and prostate cancer increased at the beginning of the period and decreased in the final years. In women, lung cancer increased, breast cancer remained stable and cervical cancer presented a significant decline from 2005 to 2010 and reached a plateau since then.\\nCancer incidence dynamics are complex and affected not only by Public Health policies such as tobacco control, vaccination and screening programs, but also by environmental and life style changes and the attitude of the medical community towards the application of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The aim of this paper is to analyze cancer incidence time trends in the country and provide possible explanations to them.\\nUruguay es el país de Sudamerica que tiene las mayores tasas de incidencia y mortalidad por cáncer. El Registro Nacional de Cáncer recoge los datos de cáncer de todo el país desde 1989 y en las últimas décadas ha alcanzado los más altos estándares de calidad. Este es el primer reporte de tendencias de incidencia de cáncer de Uruguay.\\nSe analizaron los datos de todos los casos de cáncer invasivo diagnosticados entre 2002 y 2015 incluidos en el Registro Nacional de Cáncer y los de once topografías en particular. Se calcularon las tasas de incidencia estandarizada y se analizaron las tendencias utilizando los modelos de regresión de Joinpoint.\\nLas tasas de incidencia de cáncer colorrectal, vejiga y todos los sitios reunidos se mantuvieron estables tanto en hombres como en mujeres. La tasa de incidencia de cáncer de estómago y esófago disminuyeron mientras que las de tiroides y riñón aumentaron. En los hombres, el cáncer de pulmón disminuyó, el cáncer de testículo aumentó y el de próstata aumentó en un lapso inicial y decreció en los últimos años. En las mujeres el cáncer de pulmón aumentó y el de mama se mantuvo estable mientras que el cáncer de cérvix presentó un descenso significativo entre 2005 y 2010 alcanzando una meseta desde entonces.\\nLa dinámica de la incidencia de cáncer es compleja y está afectada no sólo por las políticas de Salud Pública como las campañas de control de tabaco, vacunación y programas de tamizaje sino por los cambios ambientales y de los estilos de vida y la actitud de los médicos respecto a la aplicación de técnicas diagnósticas y terapéuticas. En este trabajo se analizan las tendencias de incidencia en el país y se plantean posibles explicaciones para los cambios. To investigate the effects of ginsenoside Rg5 on the proliferation, cycle and invasion of gastric carcinoma cell lines, providing experimental evidence for the anti-tumor mechanism of ginsenoside Rg5.\\nIn this experimental study, the human immortalized normal gastric mucosa cell GES-1 and gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines AGS and MKN-45 were treated with Rg3 and Rg5 at the concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 μmol/L for 24 h, 3 parallel holes were set for each group. A cell viability test, cell cycle analysis, transwell assay, ELISA and immunoblotting were performed.\\nThe viabilities of AGS and MKN-45 were suppressed by Rg3 and Rg5 in a concentration-dependent manner. The activity of Rg5 against gastric cancer cells was stronger than that of Rg3, and its toxicity to GES-1 was lower than that of Rg3. After the treatment of 20 μmol/L of Rg5 for 24 h, Rg5 could generate cell cycle S phase arresting by decreasing the CyclinA1/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)/proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) complex production and increasing the P21\\nThese results suggest that Rg5 exhibits stronger anti-cancer activity than Rg3 in gastric cancer cells, and has higher anti-gastric cancer cell activity than Rg3 and inhibits cell proliferation and migration by regulating the Notch1 pathway.

Here, we present a case of superficial hypopharyngeal cancer and superficial esophageal cancer for which endoscopic laryngo-pharyngeal surgery (ELPS) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) were performed simultaneously. The patient was a 67-year-old male. During his follow-up for distal gastrectomy performed earlier for stomach cancer, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed three primary cancers: superficial hypopharyngeal cancer, superficial esophageal cancer, and esophagogastric junction cancer. Total resection of the remnant stomach was performed followed by hypopharyngeal ELPS combined with esophageal ESD. He developed aspiration pneumonia after the surgery; however, he recovered and was discharged on the 16th day. Thus, safe and effective endoscopic therapy can be performed even for double superficial cancers of the laryngopharynx and esophagus. Many components of the gastric non-Helicobacter pylori microbiota have been identified recently thanks to advances in DNA sequencing techniques. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the gastric microbiome is essential for gastric disorders such as gastric cancer. Microbial interactions impact the pathophysiology of various gastric disorders. This chapter provides an overview of recent findings regarding general gastric microbial community profiling, microbial interactions in the stomach, and microbial characteristics in various gastric disorders. Developing the natural medicine that allow for the specific targeting cytotoxicity is a very important research area in the development of anti-tumor drugs.\\nThis study was conducted to determine the targeted inhibitory effects of luteolin-loaded Her-2-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) on gastric cancer cells and to delineate the mechanism underlying the inhibition of tumors by luteolin.\\nLuteolin-loaded Her-2-PLGA NPs (Her-2-NPs) were prepared, physically and chemically characterized, and their effects on gastric cancer cells were investigated. The rate of NP uptake by cells and the cell morphology were observed using confocal microscopy; the rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis were identified using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry, respectively; and the mRNA and protein expression levels of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively.\\nCompared with nontargeted microspheres, Her-2-NPs led to significantly enhanced uptake of luteolin by SGC-7901 cells. Luteolin-loaded Her-2-NPs also significantly inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, weakened their migratory ability, and increased both the mRNA and protein expression levels of FOXO1.\\nLuteolin-loading of Her-2-NPs could potentially be used as a novel anti-cancer drugs for targeted cancer therapy. The relative effectiveness of tracers in guiding para-aortic lymph node dissection (PAND) in advanced gastric cancer is undefined. In this single-center, prospective study, we aimed to discuss the effectiveness of such tracers.\\nBetween January 2015 and January 2016, 90 consecutive patients with stage T4a gastric cancer were evenly assigned to receive 0.2 mL of carbon nanoparticles (a), methylene blue (b), or no tracer (c) injection through no. 12b lymph nodes before PAND.\\nThere was no difference in the baseline characteristics between the three groups. Group A vs. B or C had a higher number of dissected lymph nodes (34.1 ± 9.8, 25.5 ± 5.5, and 22.6 ± 3.7; P < 0.001; B vs. C: P =0.321) and no. 16a2/b1 para-aortic lymph nodes (PANs; 11.8 ± 4.8, 7.0 ± 1.2, and 5.5 ± 1.2; P < 0.001; B vs. C: P =0.178) and similar rates of lymph node metastasis (20.9 ± 17.5%, 19.1 ± 15.1%, and 23.6 ± 19.7%; P = 0.511), positive dissected PAN (23.3% [7/30], 16.7% [5/30], and 16.7% [5/30]), surgery duration (252.9 + 35.4, 244.4 ± 29.0, and 250.3 + 29.9 min; P = 0.421), and blood loss (266.7 ± 115.5, 270.0 ± 82.6, and 260.0 ± 116.3 mL, P = 0.933). There was no common bile duct damage by tracer injection, and one case of duodenal stump fistula, one abdominal infection, and two anastomotic leakages in Groups A-C, respectively, were treated successfully.\\nIn advanced gastric cancer treatment, carbon nanoparticle injection into no. 12b nodes appears to better trace no. 16a2/b1 PAN.

There is a need to monitor and improve care for this disease. Pathologic information is a cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Few population-based studies combine pathology information and clinical outcomes. The objective of this study is to develop a clinical and pathological database of oesophagogastric cancers to study practice patterns, resource utilisation and clinical outcomes.\\nThe Population Registry of Esophageal and Stomach Tumours in Ontario (PRESTO) will include all patients with oesophagogastric cancer diagnosed from 2002 onwards within the province of Ontario. We estimate that the sample over the first 14 years of the study will include 26\\u2009000 patients. Pathologic information from diagnostic procedures, endomucosal resection specimens and surgical resection specimens is being abstracted into a purpose-built database. Pathology information will be linked to administrative data, which capture baseline demographics, patient-reported symptoms, physician billings, hospital visits, hospital characteristics, geography and vital statistics. The registry will be updated prospectively.\\nEthics approval for this study was obtained from the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Research Ethics Board. The PRESTO database will enable the study of oesophagogastric cancer in Ontario under six themes of inquiry: treatment, surgical outcomes, pathology, survival, health system and resource utilisation and cost. This information will be a valuable addition to the global efforts to understand ways to optimise care for these diseases. The purpose of the pilot study was to determine the potential diagnostic capabilities for the analysis of oxygen-containing salivary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in stomach and colorectal cancer.\\nSaliva samples of 11 patients with stomach cancer, 18 patients with colorectal cancer, and 16 healthy volunteers were analyzed through capillary gas chromatography. The levels of lipid peroxidation products and catalase activity were determined in all samples. To assess saliva diagnostic potential, we constructed a Classification and Regression Tree (CART).\\nIt was shown that the use of a combination of saliva VOCs (acetaldehyde, acetone, propanol-2, and ethanol) allowed classification into Cancer/Control groups with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.7 and 90.9%, respectively. To clarify the location of the tumor, it was necessary to add a methanol level; in this case, the sensitivity for detecting stomach and colorectal cancer was 80.0% and 92.3%, respectively, while the specificity in both cases was 100%. When the lipid peroxidation product content was added to the VOC indicators, they were selected as the main factors for constructing the decision tree. For classification into Cancer/Control groups, only the triene conjugate and Schiff base content in saliva was sufficient. The combination of VOCs in saliva and lipid peroxidation indices improved the sensitivity and specificity for classification to 100%.\\nPreliminary data were obtained on the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of stomach and colorectal cancer, which confirmed the promise of further studies on saliva VOCs for the purpose of clinical laboratory diagnostics. To analyze large-scale data obtained from telephone cancer consultations and clarify sex differences in the information sought by callers to guide future cancer survivor support.\\nWe qualitatively analyzed 10,534 cases of telephone consultations with cancer patients. The relationships between callers\\' words and sex were visualized through a correspondence analysis, and the keywords extracted were visualized with a dependency relationship to the words \"worry\" and \"anxiety,\" which had a high prevalence in the text data.\\nMost of the male callers sought consultation about stomach cancer (11.8%), the consultations were predominantly about \"suspicion of having cancer\" (25.2%), and males indicated that the goal was to gather accurate information. Female callers mostly sought consultation about breast cancer (18.4%) were mainly interested in learning about \"treatment\" (31.0%), and mostly used the keywords \"worry\" and \"anxiety.\" The total number of callers without a definitive diagnosis accounted for 20% of all consultations.\\nHealthcare providers need to understand unique sex-based coping styles and perform regular follow-ups. There is also a need for online platforms that provide information from the patient\\'s perspective.\\nProviding a cancer consultation support system and easy-to-understand medical information will improve communication between survivors, their families, and medical staff. The proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) family of serine/threonine-specific kinases consist of three isoforms, that regulate proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. Among these, abnormally elevated kinase activity of PIM-1 contributes to the progression of gastric cancer and predicts poor prognosis and a low survival rate in gastric cancer patients. In the present study, we found that resveratrol, one of the representative chemopreventive and anticarcinogenic phytochemicals, directly binds to PIM-1 and thereby inhibits its catalytic activity in human gastric cancer SNU-601 cells. This resulted in suppression of phosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bad, a known substrate of PIM-1. Resveratrol, by inactivating PIM-1, also inhibited anchorage-independent growth and proliferation of SNU-601\\xa0cells. To understand the molecular interaction between resveratrol and PIM-1, we conducted docking simulation and found that resveratrol directly binds to the PIM-1 at the ATP-binding pocket. In conclusion, the proapototic and anti-proliferative effects of resveratrol in gastric cancer cells are likely to be mediated through suppression of PIM-1 kinase activity, which may represent a novel mechanism underlying its chemopreventive and anticarcinogenic actions. In laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, the hepatic left lateral segment often obstructs the operative field of view, especially around the esophageal hiatus. Therefore, a safe retraction method is needed. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of inverting the hepatic left lateral segment in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.\\nThis was a retrospective review of 81 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy. Patients were divided into two groups, i.e., the Nathanson liver retractor group (n\\u2009=\\u200941) and hepatic left lateral segment inverting group (n\\u2009=\\u200940). The unedited video recordings of the procedures and the patients\\' medical records were reviewed and compared.\\nThe hepatic left lateral segment inverting method provided a more satisfactory view of the operative fields and a wider working space around the esophageal hiatus than the Nathanson liver retractor. No intraoperative hepatic congestion and significantly improved postoperative liver enzyme elevations were observed with hepatic left lateral segment inverting method compared with the Nathanson liver retractor method.\\nIn laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, the hepatic left lateral segment inverting method appears to provide improvements in both the operative field of view and liver protection compared with the Nathanson liver retractor method. Distinct prevalence of inherited genetic predisposition may partially explain the difference of cancer risks across ancestries. Ancestry-specific analyses of germline genomes are required to inform cancer genetic risk and prognosis of diverse populations.\\nWe conducted analyses using germline and somatic sequencing data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Collapsing pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants to cancer predisposition genes (CPG), we analyzed the association between CPGs and cancer types within ancestral groups. We also identified the predisposition-associated two-hit events and gene expression effects in tumors.\\nGenetic ancestry analysis classified the cohort of 9899 cancer cases into individuals of primarily European (N\\u2009=\\u20098184, 82.7%), African (N\\u2009=\\u2009966, 9.8%), East Asian (N\\u2009=\\u2009649, 6.6%), South Asian (N\\u2009=\\u200948, 0.5%), Native/Latin American (N\\u2009=\\u200941, 0.4%), and admixed (N\\u2009=\\u200911, 0.1%) ancestries. In the African ancestry, we discovered a potentially novel association of BRCA2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (OR\\u2009=\\u200941.4 [95% CI, 6.1-275.6]; FDR\\u2009=\\u20090.002) previously identified in Europeans, along with a known association of BRCA2 in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OR\\u2009=\\u20098.5 [95% CI, 1.5-47.4]; FDR\\u2009=\\u20090.045). In the East Asian ancestry, we discovered one previously known association of BRIP1 in stomach adenocarcinoma (OR\\u2009=\\u200912.8 [95% CI, 1.8-90.8]; FDR\\u2009=\\u20090.038). Rare variant burden analysis further identified 7 suggestive associations in African ancestry individuals previously described in European ancestry, including SDHB in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, ATM in prostate adenocarcinoma, VHL in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, FH in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and PTEN in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Most predisposing variants were found exclusively in one ancestry in the TCGA and gnomAD datasets. Loss of heterozygosity was identified for 7 out of the 15 African ancestry carriers of predisposing variants. Further, tumors from the SDHB or BRCA2 carriers showed simultaneous allelic-specific expression and low gene expression of their respective affected genes, and FH splice-site variant carriers showed mis-splicing of FH.\\nWhile several CPGs are shared across patients, many pathogenic variants are found to be ancestry-specific and trigger somatic effects. Studies using larger cohorts of diverse ancestries are required to pinpoint ancestry-specific genetic predisposition and inform genetic screening strategies. Metastatic intraluminal cancer arising from gastrointestinal tract cancer is very rare. In this report, we describe a case of an 82-year-old man with sequentially metastatic gastric and jejunal cancer originating from primary colon cancer.\\nAn 82-year-old Korean male patient with a history of right colon cancer was initially treated with extended right hemicolectomy. The tumour was classified as pT3N0M0 and stage II. After nine months, a gastroscopy revealed an infiltrating ulcerative mass in the cardia of the stomach, a colonoscopy revealed no specific findings in the previous operation site, and a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan revealed no distant metastasis. The patient underwent radical total gastrectomy, and the final pathologic diagnosis was T3N2M0, stage IIIA. During follow-up without chemotherapy, a gastroscopy revealed tumours in the blind jejunal loop of Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and an endoscopic biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. The patient then underwent segmental resection of the blind loop jejunal cancer. Finally, further pathological examination of the resected specimen confirmed that the lesion represented a sequentially metastatic gastric and jejunal cancer originating from colon cancer.\\nThe exact mechanism of intraluminal metastasis of gastrointestinal tract cancer is not known. Immunohistochemical staining might prove useful in sequentially metastatic cases when a differential diagnosis must be assessed on consecutive biopsies.\\nAlthough intraluminal metastasis of gastrointestinal tract cancer is very rare, researchers should be aware of this uncommon intraluminal metastasis. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor. The drug may have efficacy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.\\nIn an open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan as compared with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. Patients with centrally confirmed HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed while they were receiving at least two previous therapies, including trastuzumab, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks) or physician\\'s choice of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review. Secondary end points included overall survival, response duration, progression-free survival, confirmed response (response persisting ≥4 weeks), and safety.\\nOf 187 treated patients, 125 received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 62 chemotherapy (55 received irinotecan and 7 paclitaxel). An objective response was reported in 51% of the patients in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group, as compared with 14% of those in the physician\\'s choice group (P<0.001). Overall survival was longer with trastuzumab deruxtecan than with chemotherapy (median, 12.5 vs. 8.4 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.88; P\\u2009=\\u20090.01, which crossed the prespecified O\\'Brien-Fleming boundary [0.0202 on the basis of number of deaths]). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 51% of the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 24% of the physician\\'s choice group), anemia (38% and 23%, respectively), and decreased white-cell count (21% and 11%). A total of 12 patients had trastuzumab deruxtecan-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis (grade 1 or 2 in 9 patients and grade 3 or 4 in 3), as adjudicated by an independent committee. One drug-related death (due to pneumonia) was noted in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group; no drug-related deaths occurred in the physician\\'s choice group.\\nTherapy with trastuzumab deruxtecan led to significant improvements in response and overall survival, as compared with standard therapies, among patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Myelosuppression and interstitial lung disease were the notable toxic effects. (Funded by Daiichi Sankyo; DESTINY-Gastric01 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03329690.). Gastric cancer (GC) has a very poor prognosis when diagnosed at a late stage. Acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (ACOT7) is a major isoform of the acyl coenzyme family that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs into unesterified free fatty acid and coenzyme A. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression levels of ACOT7 in GC and mechanisms related therewith.\\nScreening of systematic biology studies revealed ACOT7 as a key gene in GC, as well as involvement of the long non-coding RNA NMRAL2P in ACOT7 expression. In this study, GC tissues and adjacent tissue samples were obtained from 10 GC patients at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery. GES1 and SGC-7901 cells were collected and treated to silence ACOT7 and overexpress NMRAL2P. The expressions of ACOT7 and NMRAL2P were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. Additionally, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were examined.\\nACOT7 was upregulated in gastric tumor tissues and GC cell lines. ACOT7 gene silencing induced a less malignant phenotype and was closely correlated to reduced cell proliferation and migration, altered cell cycle, and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, NMRAL2P was downregulated in tumor tissues and GC cell lines. NMRAL2P overexpression induced a more malignant phenotype and significantly inhibited the expression of ACOT7. Importantly, NMRAL2P indirectly methylated ACOT7 by binding to DNMT3b, thereby suppressing ACOT7 expression.\\nNMRAL2P activation suppresses ACOT7 expression in GC. Thus, ACOT7 could be a promising target for the treatment of GC. None We encountered a rare case of gastric adenocarcinoma considered to arise from a sporadic fundic gland polyp (FGP). A woman in her 70\\xa0s, who had been prescribed a proton pump inhibitor for 5\\xa0years, was referred to our institution for further investigation and treatment of a gastric lesion. White light endoscopy showed numerous isochromatic FGPs in the greater curvature of the gastric body and a 15-mm reddish polypoid lesion with uneven surface characteristics. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging revealed an irregular granular microsurface structure with irregular microvessels, which is suggestive of cancer. The absence of atrophic changes in the entire gastric mucosa was confirmed endoscopically and histologically, and multiple Helicobacter pylori (HP) tests were negative. An en bloc resection was performed by polypectomy. The specimen showed adenocarcinoma that was thought to arise from an FGP. The lesion consisted of cystically dilated fundic glands in the basal part and neoplastic cells with nuclear atypia and high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio in the foveolar part; on the basis of these findings, noninvasive adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. Although both adenocarcinoma in an HP-uninfected stomach and epithelial high-grade dysplasia in a sporadic FGP are extremely rare, this possibility should be considered when performing esophagogastroduodenoscopy. A 48-year-old man presented with epigastralgia and back pain. Radiological evaluation revealed a pancreatic tail tumor with contrast enhancement and an intratumoral fluid component involving the splenic artery and invading the left kidney. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma, and based on invasion of the left kidney, the patient was diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer with suspected peritoneal dissemination. Radiological evaluation performed after the administration of eight courses of gemcitabine combined with nab-paclitaxel revealed stable disease without distant metastases or peritoneal dissemination. We planned to perform radical resection; however, the patient developed a pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery preoperatively and initially underwent preoperative coil embolization, followed by radical resection (distal pancreatectomy with combined left nephrectomy and partial resection of the colon and stomach), 11\\xa0days after embolization. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen confirmed R0 resection, and the splenic artery pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic cancer was attributed to tumor invasion of this vessel. He showed satisfactory postoperative recovery and was discharged on the 24th day after surgery with administration of S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus‑2 (SARS‑CoV2) is the cause of a new disease (COVID‑19) which has evolved into a pandemic during the first half of 2020. Older age, male sex and certain underlying diseases, including cancer, appear to significantly increase the risk for severe COVID‑19. SARS‑CoV‑2 infection of host cells is facilitated by the angiotensin‑converting enzyme\\xa02 (ACE‑2), and by transmembrane protease serine\\xa02 (TMPRSS2) and other host cell proteases such as cathepsin\\xa0L (CTSL). With the exception of ACE‑2, a systematic analysis of these two other SARS‑CoV2 infection mediators in malignancies is lacking. Here, we analysed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 and CTSL across a wide spectrum of tumors and controls. TMPRSS2 was overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma, with PRAD and READ exhibiting the highest expression of all cancers. CTSL was upregulated in lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma, oesophageal carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, lower grade glioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thymoma. Hypo‑methylation of both genes was evident in most cases where they have been highly upregulated. We have expanded on our observations by including data relating to mutations and copy number alterations at pan‑cancer level. The novel hypotheses that are stemming out of these data need to be further investigated and validated in large clinical studies. Tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are self-molecules abnormally expressed on tumor cells, which elicit humoral and cellular immunity and are targets of immunosurveillance. Immunity to TAAs is found in some healthy individuals with no history of cancer and correlates positively with a history of acute inflammatory and infectious events and cancer risk reduction. This suggests a potential role in cancer immunosurveillance for the immune memory elicited against disease-associated antigens (DAA) expressed on infected and inflamed tissues that are later recognized on tumors as TAAs. To understand probable sources for DAA generation, we investigated  Oral vaccination enables pain-free and self-administrable vaccine delivery for rapid mass vaccination during pandemic outbreaks. Furthermore, it elicits systemic and mucosal immune responses. This protects against infection at mucosal surfaces, which may further enhance protection and minimize the spread of disease. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract presents a number of prospective mucosal inductive sites for vaccine targeting, including the oral cavity, stomach, and small intestine. However, currently available oral vaccines are effectively limited to live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines against enteric diseases. The GI tract poses a number of challenges, including degradative processes that digest biologics and mucosal barriers that limit their absorption. This review summarizes the approaches currently under development and future opportunities for oral vaccine delivery to established (intestinal) and relatively new (oral cavity, stomach) mucosal targets. Special consideration is given to recent advances in oral biologic delivery that offer promise as future platforms for the administration of oral vaccines. Expected final online publication date for the  Gastric cancer patients with severe peritoneal metastases, defined as massive ascites and/or inadequate oral intake, have been excluded from clinical trials of new treatments due to poor prognosis and tumor-related complications, such as ileus. Based on the results of the JCOG1108/WJOG7312G study, their prognosis when treated with 5-fluorouracil/ Transcription factors represent the crucial role of controlling gene transcription in cancer development and progression. However, their functions in gastric cancer have not been thoroughly characterized. For this study, we comprehensively evaluated the correlation between infiltration patterns of tumor microenvironment (TME) cells and TFs expression in the cohort of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) from TCGA database. We integrally explored differential expression panel and prognostic value of candidate TFs in TCGA-STAD cohort. Notably, we found a key transcription factor named HEYL, which its expression level was correlated with stromal component transformation of TME. HEYL was regularly high expressed in gastric cancer and correlated with patients\\' poor prognosis. Knockdown of HEYL prominently abrogated the tendency of cell proliferation, migration, and progression in gastric cancer. Consistently, overexpression of HEYL strikingly accelerated the gastric carcinoma development through activating oncogenic signaling pathways and transcriptional activation of cadherin 11 (CDH11). Our findings not only identified the close relationship between TFs and TME phenotype, but also emphasized the crucial importance of TFs, especially HEYL, which could be identified as a candidate biomarker to evaluate prognostic risk and therapeutic effect in gastric cancer. Gold supra-pyramid structures were obtained by the addition of acidic solution of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) to an aqueous solution of citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNP). The reaction resulted in the precipitation of supra-pyramid from the solution after just 1\\u2005min of shaking. Microscopic images confirmed formation of the supra-pyramid. The stepwise structural transformation towards the supra-pyramid was examined with variable concentrations of CB[8] to AuNP solution. Anionic counter parts of these acids (Br It is unknown whether the degree of response to preoperative therapy correlates with locoregional recurrence (LR) or distant recurrence (DR) after resection of gastric cancer.\\nPatients who underwent resection of gastric adenocarcinoma following chemotherapy and chemoradiation (1995-2015) were reviewed. The tumor regression grade (TRG) was defined by the percentage of viable tumor cells in the specimen (TRG0\\u2009=\\u20090%; TRG1\\u2009=\\u20091%-2%; TRG2\\u2009=\\u20093%-50%; TRG3\\u2009≥\\u200950%). The relationships among TRG, recurrence-free survival (RFS), LR, and DR were examined.\\nTwo hundred forty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria (TRG0, 52 [21%]; TRG1, 49 [20%]; TRG2, 98 [40%]; TRG3, 48 [19%]). LR and DR occurred in 6.1% and 32.0% of patients, respectively. No patient with TRG0 experienced LR. R1 resection (6%-15%) and LR (6%-8%) rates were similar among TRG1-3 patients. R1 resection was associated with LR (hazard ratio [HR], 17.85; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). ypN status (HR, 2.44; P\\u2009=\\u2009.004) and linitis plastica (HR, 2.90; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001) were associated with DR. TRG was not independently associated with RFS, LR, or DR.\\nTRG0 imparted excellent local control. However, TRG1-3 patients had similar R1 resection rates and therefore similar LR. DR is associated with ypN status and linitis plastica, not TRG. The prognosis for gastric carcinoma (GC) remains challenging with less than 35% of patients surviving 5\\xa0years. GC survival varies greatly by anatomical site, cardia and non-cardia. However, these important differences have not been thoroughly studied in relation to the increasing diversity in US populations such as Florida. In this study we examined, for the first time, the effect of race-ethnicity on risk of death from GC controlling for potential risk factors separately for cardia and non-cardia GCs.\\nData on GCs diagnosed in Florida from 2005-2016 were obtained from the statewide cancer registry. Age-standardized GC-specific 5-year survival was computed by anatomical site and race-ethnicity. In addition, a competing risk analysis was performed to assess prognostic factors and to estimate subdistribution hazard ratios of death from GC.\\nWhites had high proportions of cardia GC (43.9%) compared to all racial/ethnic minorities (10.9%, 19.6%, and 13.8% in Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, respectively; p\\u2009<\\u2009.0001). Among 12,302 cases included, there were 7534 deaths from GC and 1179 from other causes. Age standardized GC-specific 5-year survival was significantly lower for Whites (28.0%) compared to Blacks (31.6%), Hispanics (37.6%), and Asians, (39.6%) and significantly lower for cardia GC (25.0%, 95% CI 23.4-26.6) compared to non-cardia GC (37.0%, 95% CI 35.5-38.4). Multivariable competing risk analysis in patients with non-cardia GC showed that Asians (sHR: 0.64, 95% CI 0.51-0.80), Hispanics (sHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.78), and Blacks (sHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.92) all had lower risks of death from GC compared to Whites. In patients with cardia GC, only Hispanics had statistically significant lower risk of death from GC than Whites (sHR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.95, p\\u2009=\\u20090.005).\\nThe study of racial/ethnic survival disparities in patients with GC in Florida reveals Whites as the most disadvantaged group. Whites are more afflicted by cardia GC, which is associated with higher risk of death than non-cardia GC. However, even within non-cardia GC, Whites had higher risk of death than the other racial-ethnic groups. Commonly assessed survival determinants do not adequately explain these unusual disparities; thus, further investigation is warranted. Air pollution and smoking are associated with various types of mortality, including cancer. The current study utilizes a publicly accessible, nationally representative cohort to explore relationships between fine particulate matter (PM\\nNational Health Interview Survey and mortality follow-up data were combined to create a study population of 635,539 individuals surveyed from 1987 to 2014. A sub-cohort of 341,665 never-smokers from the full cohort was also created. Individuals were assigned modeled PM\\nThe risk of all cancer mortality was adversely associated with PM\\nExposure to PM Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases atherosclerotic cardiovascular complications and cancer risks. Stomach cancer is the most common cancer in Korea. Although the survival rate of stomach cancer has improved, the disease burden is still high.\\nThis retrospective study investigated the association between metformin use and stomach cancer incidence in a Korean population using the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort database. Participants aged 40-80 years old at the baseline period (2002-2003) were enrolled. The study population was categorized into three groups of metformin non-users with DM, metformin users with DM, and individuals without DM (No DM group).\\nA total of 347,895 participants (14,922 metformin non-users, 9891 metformin users, and 323,082 individuals without DM) were included in the final analysis. The median follow-up duration was 12.70\\xa0years. The estimated cumulative incidence of stomach cancer was highest in metformin non-users and lowest in the No DM group (men vs. women: 3.75 vs. 1.97% in metformin non-users, 2.91 vs. 1.53% in metformin users, and 2.54 vs. 0.95% in the No DM group). Compared with metformin non-users, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for stomach cancer incidence of metformin users and the No DM group were 0.710 (0.579-0.870) and 0.879 (0.767-1.006) in men and 0.700 (0.499-0.981) and 0.701 (0.544-0.903) in women, respectively, after full adjustment.\\nMetformin users with DM in the Korean population were at lower risk of stomach cancer incidence after controlling for potential confounding factors. To quantify the change in risk and aging factors with a two time point analysis for major cancers to assess supportive strategies.\\nThe 2004 and 2015 mortality statistics in China were accessed. The standardized mortality rates of the two periods were used to calculate the ratio of change (RC) value to assess the risk of death associated with time (social development with time) for cancers. The role of age in mortality with time was evaluated by the interaction between time and age using a Poisson regression.\\nIn ascending order of RC, the factors were uterus; other malignant neoplasms; esophagus; stomach; skin; liver; leukemia; \"lip, oral cavity, and pharynx\"; bladder; \"colon and rectum\"; breast; prostate; lung; ovary; pancreas; \"lymphoid, hematopoietic, and related tissue\"; and cervix cancers. According to their location on the scatter diagram, the 17 neoplasms could be divided into three groups, comprising undeveloped cancers (including four cancers), developed cancers (including three cancers), and cancers insensitive to social development. Unexpectedly, about 60% (as assessed by type of cancer) and two-thirds (as assessed by constituent ratio of death from all cancers) of cancers did not change with time.\\nMost cancers may be insensitive to social development. Internal factors, including aging, may be a key factor for the occurrence of cancer. This is the first report on near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) clip-guided gastrectomy. The NIRF clip, ZEOCLIP FS, emits NIRF signals when excited. We hypothesized that preoperative placement of the ZEOCLIP FS near a gastric lesion would allow fluorescence laparoscopic localization of the clip, and hence, the lesion, during surgery. We report this technique in two cases.\\nCase 1: An 81-year-old female was diagnosed with early gastric cancer and a pedunculated 4 cm large hyperplastic polyp that had prolapsed into the duodenum, and was scheduled for laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, due to the potential risk of dissection of the polyp with the duodenal wall. On the day before surgery, ZEOCLIP FS clips were endoscopically placed at the cancer site and the polyp. The locations of the fluorescent clips were confirmed intraoperatively using a full-color fluorescence laparoscope.\\nAn 81-year-old male was scheduled for laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer under fluorescent clip-guidance. Clip locations could not be confirmed during initial intraoperative observation. However, when the stomach wall was raised using forceps during a second observation attempt, the fluorescent clip locations were confirmed.\\nIn case 1, it was easy to confirm clip location, facilitating complete resection of early gastric cancer without dissecting the polyp. In case 2, the fluorescent clip was located by raising the stomach and adjusting the angle between the stomach wall and the fluorescence laparoscope.\\nThe positive results of these two cases warrant conducting feasibility studies for use of this method. Neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for advanced stages of gastric cancer (> T2, N+) before tumour resection in many European guidelines. However, there is no consensus as to whether perioperative chemotherapy is as effective in distal as in proximal tumours, in addition to a relevant uncertainty concerning appropriate treatment modalities for elderly patients.\\nTo investigate the role of perioperative chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer in patients from a German tertiary clinic with respect to efficacy, localisation, and age.\\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of 158 patients from our clinic with adenocarcinoma of the stomach or the gastroesophageal junction who underwent resection between 2008 and 2016. The data were evaluated particularly in relation to patient age, tumour site, and perioperative therapy.\\nAdministration of perioperative chemotherapy did not lead to a significant survival advantage in our study population. The 5-year survival rates were 40% for patients who received perioperative chemotherapy and 29% for the group without perioperative chemotherapy (\\nThis analysis reconfirms our previous data concerning the effectiveness of perioperative chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer. There is reasonable doubt that the quality of the existing randomized controlled trials is sufficient to generally justify perioperative chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer independent of tumour localization or age. Radiation therapy for mesothelioma remains challenging, as normal tissue toxicity limits the amount of radiation that can be safely delivered to the pleural surfaces, especially radiation dose to the contralateral lung. The physical properties of proton therapy result in better sparing of normal tissues when treating the pleura, both in the postpneumonectomy setting and the lung-intact setting. Compared with photon radiation, there are dramatic reductions in dose to the contralateral lung, heart, liver, kidneys, and stomach. However, the tissue heterogeneity in the thorax, organ motion, and potential for changing anatomy during the treatment course all present challenges to optimal irradiation with protons.\\nThe clinical data underlying proton therapy in mesothelioma are reviewed here, including indications, advantages, and limitations.\\nThe Particle Therapy Cooperative Group Thoracic Subcommittee task group provides specific guidelines for the use of proton therapy for mesothelioma.\\nThis consensus report can be used to guide clinical practice, insurance approval, and future research. Decades of research show that people with schizophrenia have an increased risk of death from cancer; however, the relationship between schizophrenia and cancer incidence remains less clear. This population-based study investigates the incidence of seven common types of cancer among people with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia and accounting for the effects of age, sex and calendar time.\\nThis population-based study used 1990-2013 data from three nationwide Swedish registries to calculate the incidence (in total, by age group and by sex) of any cancer and of lung, oesophageal, pancreatic, stomach, colon, (in men) prostate and (in women) breast cancer in 111 306 people with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia. The incidence in people with diagnosed schizophrenia was compared with the incidence in the general population. Risk estimates accounted for the effects of calendar time.\\nIn 1 424 829 person-years of follow-up, schizophrenia did not confer an overall higher cancer risk (IRR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91-1.13) but was associated with a higher risk for female breast (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.26), lung (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.28-1.58), oesophageal (IRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.46) and pancreatic (IRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.21) and a lower risk of prostate (IRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.55-0.79) cancer. Some age- and sex-specific differences in risk were observed.\\nPeople with schizophrenia do not have a higher overall incidence of cancer than people in the general population. However, there are significant differences in the risk of specific cancer types overall and by sex calling for efforts to develop disease-specific prevention programmes. In people with schizophrenia, higher risk generally occurs in those <75 years. Gastric cancer (GC) is a common gastrointestinal cancer with a high global mortality. Recent reports have suggested that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are implicated in multiple aspects of GC, including pathogenesis, progression, and therapeutic response. Herein, we investigated the function of FOXD1-AS1 in GC progression and chemoresistance. Expression of FOXD1-AS1 was low in normal stomach tissues but was upregulated in GC cell lines. Silencing of FOXD1-AS1 impaired GC cell proliferation and motility in\\xa0vitro, and repressed tumor growth and metastasis in\\xa0vivo. Importantly, FOXD1-AS1 upregulation increased the resistance of GC cells to cisplatin. Moreover, we found that FOXD1-AS1 promoted FOXD1 protein translation through the eIF4G-eIF4E-eIF4A translational complex. We also demonstrated that FOXD1-AS1 released eIF4E from phosphorylated 4E-BP1 and thereby strengthened the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was due to the post-transcriptional upregulation of PIK3CA, in turn induced by FOXD1-AS1-mediated sequestering of microRNA (miR)-466. Furthermore, we verified that FOXD1-AS1 facilitated GC progression and cisplatin resistance in a FOXD1-dependent manner. In conclusion, FOXD1-AS1 aggravates GC progression and chemoresistance by promoting FOXD1 translation via PIK3CA/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. These findings highlight a novel target for treatment of patients GC, particularly patients with cisplatin resistance. None None None None None Results of comparative ELISA investigation of pretreatment sPD-1 and sPD-L1 content in blood plasma of 100 gastric cancer patients at various disease stages aged 25 to 81 years are presented. Control group included 60 practically healthy donors aged 18 - 68 years. Plasma sPD-L1 concentrations did not differ between gastric cancer patients and control group, and sPD-1 levels were statistically significantly lower in patients than in healthy donors (p<0.0001). Positive correlation (R=0.38; p=0.003) was revealed between plasma sPD-1 и sPD-L1 levels in control group and negative (R= -0.26; p=0,009) - in gastric cancer patients. ROC curve revealed the best sPD-1 cut-off level (< 21 pg/ml) with 77% sensitivity and 63.3% specificity, which is not sufficient for its application as diagnostic marker. Statistically significant increase of plasma sPD-L1 from stage I to stage IIIC (R=0.50; p=0.000011) was found. Analysis of associations between the evaluated markers\\' levels and indices of gastric cancer expansion according to TNM system revealed statistically significant positive associations of plasma sPD -L1 levels with T (tumor invasiondepth) and N (number of affected lymph nodes) indices: R=0.33; p=0.00093, and R=0.27; p=0.0099 respectively. sPD-L1 level was significantly increased in patients with low differentiated adenocarcinoma and cricoid-cell cancer as compared to highly differentiated adenocarcinoma (p=0.02 and p=0.004 respectively); in patients with cricoid-cell cancer it was also higher than in those with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (p=0.043) and undifferentiated cancer (p=0.049). Plasma sPD-1 level did not depend on disease stage, TNM system indices and tumor histological structure. Thus, soluble ligand sPD-L1, but not its receptor sPD-1, plasma level is increased in patients with unfavorable clinical and morphological characteristics, may be regarded as potentially valuable prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients\\' survival, and probably as a predictor of anti - PD-1/PD-L1 treatment efficiency. One of the most common treatment for gastric cancer is chemotherapy, however, multiple drug resistance (MDR) induce the therapeutic effect which result in the failure of anticancer therapy. Dihydromyricetin (DMY) was reported to have antitumor activities on various human cancer cells in vitro, our previous studies demonstrated that DMY combined with mitomycin has inhibitory effect on proliferation of gastric carcinoma cells. However, the underlying role of DMY reversing the MDR of gastric carcinoma is poor understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reversal effect of DMY on MDR and investigate the molecular mechanisms in vitro.\\nUsing MTT assay, we identified the toxicity of DMY on SGC7901 and SGC7901/5-FU cells. The effect of DMY on 5-FU induced apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. Using RT-PCR and Western blot, we determined the MDR1 mRNA and protein expression.\\nDMY induced growth inhibition in both SGC7901 and SGC7901/5-FU cells, the IC50 value was 13.64±1.15 µg/mL, 20.69±1.82 µg/mL respectively. DMY treatment sensitized SGC7901/5-FU cells to cytotoxicity of 5-FU. The combination of DMY with 5-FU increased the apoptosis rate (9.91%, 16.67%) comparing with 5-FU alone (5.25%). Comparing with the control group, the MDR1 mRNA and protein expression in SGC7901/5-FU cells after treatment of DMY decreased significantly (P< 0.05).\\nIn brief, our study demonstrated that DMY effectively reversed multi-drug resistance occurring in SGC7901/5-FU cells cultured in vitro, and the potential mechanism was involved in the downregulation of the MDR1 expression. To examine the effect of schistosomiasis on the development of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer.\\nThe clinical data of patients with gastric cancer and colorectal cancer with and without schistosomiasis japonica that were admitted to the Yijishan Hospital Affiliated to Wannan Medical College from January 2014 to December 2018 were collected. All cases were divided into schistosomal gastric cancer group and non - schistosomal gastric cancer group, schistosomal colorectal cancer group and non-schistosomal colorectal cancer group. The risk factors of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer were identified using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the effects of schistosomiasis on the development and progression of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer were evaluated. In addition, the survival of 32 patients with schistosomal colorectal cancer and 68 cases with non-schistosomal colorectal were estimated using telephone follow-up, and compared.\\nThere were 113 patients with schistosomal gastric cancer and 3 741 cases with non-schistosomal gastric cancer enrolled in this study, and there were significant differences between them in terms of sex ratio, age and prevalence of \\nSchistosomiasis may alter the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, resulting in the differences in the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and 5-year survival rate between patients with schistosomal and non-schistosomal colorectal cancer. Periodical gastrointestinal endoscopy and other examinations are recommended to exclude the likelihood of gastrointestinal cancers in men with anemia of unknown causes and at ages of 60 years living in schistosomiasis-endemic areas. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a group 1 carcinogen, induces mutagenic DNA adducts. Myricetin is present in many natural foods with diverse biological activities, such as anti-oxidative and anti-cancer activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of myricetin against B[a]P-induced toxicity. Treatment of B[a]P induced cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells, whereas co-treatment of myricetin with B[a]P reduced the formation of the B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)-DNA adduct, which recovered cell viability. Furthermore, we found a protective effect of myricetin against B[a]P-induced genotoxicity in rats, via myricetin-induced inhibition of 8-hydroxy-2\\'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and BPDE-DNA adduct formation in the liver, kidney, colon, and stomach tissue. This inhibition was more prominent in the liver than in other tissues. Correspondingly, myricetin regulated the phase I and II enzymes that inhibit B[a]P metabolism and B[a]P metabolites conjugated with DNA by reducing and inducing CYP1A1 and glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression, respectively. Taken together, this showed that myricetin attenuated B[a]P-induced genotoxicity via regulation of phase I and II enzymes. Our results suggest that myricetin is anti-genotoxic, and prevents oxidative DNA damage and BPDE-DNA adduct formation via regulation of phase I and II enzymes. A 75-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer (T1N0M0, Gleason score 4 + 3) was referred to radionuclide bone scan and Ga-PSMA PET/CT to detect recurrence. Multiple abnormal foci were observed in the axial and appendicular skeleton, which were suggestive of metastatic superscan from prostate cancer. However, histopathological examinations (from bone biopsy) did not support the metastases from prostate cancer. Ga-FAPI PET/CT was then performed to detect the occult tumor, which showed intense activity in the gastric wall. Subsequent gastroscopy examination revealed the diagnosis of GSRCC (gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma). The diagnosis of GSRCC with widespread bone metastases was finally made. Cancer mortality has declined over the last three decades in most high-income countries reflecting improvements in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and management. However, there are persisting and substantial differences in mortality, incidence, and survival worldwide. In order to provide an up-to-date overview of trends in mortality, incidence, and survival, we retrieved data from high-quality, population-based cancer registries for all cancers and 10 selected cancer sites in six high-income countries and the European Union. We computed age-standardized (world standard population) mortality and incidence rates, and applied joinpoint regression models. Mortality from all cancers and most common cancer sites has declined over the last 25\\u2009years, except for the pancreas and lung (in women). The patterns for incidence are less consistent between countries, except for a steady decrease in stomach cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in men. Survival for all cancers and the selected cancer sites increased in all countries, even if there is still a substantial variability. Although overall cancer death rates continue to decline, incidence rates have been levelling off among men and have been moderately increasing among women. These trends reflect changes in cancer risk factors, screening test use, diagnostic practices, and treatment advances. Many cancers can be prevented or treated effectively if they are diagnosed early. Population-based cancer incidence and mortality data can be used to focus efforts to decrease the cancer burden and regularly monitor progress towards cancer control goals. Patients who receive trastuzumab (T-mab) plus chemotherapy for stage IV HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer sometimes respond remarkably well and can undergo radical surgery. However, the clinical outcomes of preoperative T-mab combined chemotherapy with radical gastrectomy remain unclear. We conducted this study to investigate the clinical outcomes of this multimodal treatment.\\nFrom among a total of 199 patients who received T-mab-based chemotherapy for stage IV HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer between 2011 and 2018, the subjects of this retrospective analysis were 20 patients who subsequently underwent radical gastrectomy.\\nSeven patients had gastroesophageal junction cancer and 13 had gastric cancer. Eleven patients had unresectable stage IV cancer and 9 had resectable metastatic disease. Chemotherapy regimens included capecitabine, cisplatin\\u2009+\\u2009T-mab (11 patients), and S-1, oxaliplatin\\u2009+\\u2009T-mab (nine patients). The median number of chemotherapy cycles before surgery was three (range, 2-62). During preoperative chemotherapy, grade 3/4 adverse events developed in six patients. None suffered grade\\u2009≥\\u20093b postoperative complications. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 58.9% and 89.5%, respectively.\\nCombined preoperative T-mab-based chemotherapy and surgery appears to be safe and effective for stage IV HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, with a clinically meaningful impact on RFS and OS. To investigate the clinicopathological features and survival outcomes between young and old patients with gastric cancer (GC), and further determine the role of young age in the prognosis of GC.\\nPatients with stage I-III gastric adenocarcinomas undergoing curative surgery were enrolled, divided into young (aged 18-49\\xa0years, YG), middle-aged (50-59\\xa0years, MG), and old (≥\\u200960\\xa0years, OG) groups. Exclusion criteria were neoadjuvant therapy and history of malignant tumors. Clinicopathological features, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and recurrence patterns were compared among three groups.\\n1131 patients were finally included, with 270, 314, and 547 cases in the YG, MG, and OG, respectively. Compared to others, YG had higher proportion of female, middle-third gastric cancer, poor differentiation, N3b stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy. YG demonstrated poorer 5-year OS than MG (62.4% vs. 70.8%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.019), but better than OG (62.4% vs. 58.7%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.031). YG also suffered inferior 5-year DFS (75.2% vs. 82.8%, P\\u2009=\\u20090.040) compared with MG, and higher incidence of peritoneal recurrence than MG (15.1% vs. 5.2%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and OG (15.1% vs. 4.1%, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis identified young age as the independent prognostic factor for OS [hazard ratio (HR)\\u2009=\\u20091.347, 95% CI 1.018-1.781, P\\u2009=\\u20090.037], DFS (HR\\u2009=\\u20091.601, 95% CI 1.079-2.376, P\\u2009=\\u20090.019), and peritoneal recurrence (HR\\u2009=\\u20092.936, 95% CI 1.505-5.726, P\\u2009=\\u20090.002).\\nYoung GC patients demonstrated aggressive features with poor prognosis and enhanced management may be warranted for this subgroup. Previous studies have suggested that in addition to respiratory system cancers, exposure to external airborne agents (EAAs) may also affect the risk of digestive tract cancer. However, previous epidemiological studies have been limited. To clarify this relationship, we conducted a Workers\\' Korea National Health Insurance Service cohort study. The EAA exposure group comprised participants who had ever visited a hospital as an inpatient for \\'lung diseases due to external agents\\'. The reference population comprised men from the general working population. The EAA exposure group and reference group included a total of 98,666 and 79,959,286 person-years, respectively. Age-adjusted standardized incident rates (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated for each 5-year age stratum. The SIR (95% CI) of EAA exposure was 1.30 (1.19-1.38) for all digestive tract cancers. The highest risk associated with EAA exposure was observed for oral cancer, followed by esophageal and stomach cancers [SIRs (95%CI): 3.96 (3.02-4.78), 3.47(2.60-4.25), and 1.34(1.17-1.47), respectively.] These statistically significant associations did not be attenuated in a subgroup analysis using logistic regression adjusted for age, smoking and alcohol consumption. Our findings suggest that EAA exposure should address risk reduction of both digestive tract and respiratory system cancers. Colonization of the human stomach with Helicobacter pylori strains containing the cag pathogenicity island is a risk factor for development of gastric cancer. The cag pathogenicity island contains genes encoding a secreted effector protein (CagA) and components of a type IV secretion system (Cag T4SS). The molecular architecture of the H. pylori Cag T4SS is substantially more complex than that of prototype T4SSs in other bacterial species. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries pertaining to the structure and function of the Cag T4SS and its role in gastric cancer pathogenesis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising treatment option for potential resectable gastric cancer, but patients\\' responses vary. We aimed to develop and validate a radiomics score (rad_score) to predict treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to investigate its efficacy in survival stratification.\\nA total of 106 patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before gastrectomy were included (training cohort: n\\u2009=\\u200974; validation cohort: n\\u2009=\\u200932). Radiomics features were extracted from the pre-treatment portal venous-phase CT. After feature reduction, a rad_score was established by Randomised Tree algorithm. A rad_clinical_score was constructed by integrating the rad_score with clinical variables, so was a clinical score by clinical variables only. The three scores were validated regarding their discrimination and clinical usefulness. The patients were stratified into two groups according to the score thresholds (updated with post-operative clinical variables), and their survivals were compared.\\nIn the validation cohort, the rad_score demonstrated a good predicting performance in treatment response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AUC [95% CI] =0.82 [0.67, 0.98]), which was better than the clinical score (based on pre-operative clinical variables) without significant difference (0.62 [0.42, 0.83], P\\u2009=\\u20090.09). The rad_clinical_score could not further improve the performance of the rad_score (0.70 [0.51, 0.88], P\\u2009=\\u20090.16). Based on the thresholds of these scores, the high-score groups all achieved better survivals than the low-score groups in the whole cohort (all P\\u2009<\\u20090.001).\\nThe rad_score that we developed was effective in predicting treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in stratifying patients with gastric cancer into different survival groups. Our proposed strategy is useful for individualised treatment planning. India is now regarded as the country with one of the highest incidence of oral cancer in the world. Considering poor survival in cases with late diagnosis, early detection can reduce morbidity and mortality of cancer patients and may impede malignant transformation in cases of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD). Most of the diagnostic aids are expensive and not available for mass screenings in developing countries. There is a need to develop a sensitive and affordable technique for screening of oral cancer, which can be accurate even in hands of health care workers with limited experience. Fluorescein dye has been used for tumour detection in colon, stomach, breast and brain. However, its utility in the diagnosis of oral cancer and OPMD has not yet been explored.\\nThis is the first study to report the role of fluorescein in the detection of oral cancer and OPMD. The present cross sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care dental centre. It included 100 individuals presenting with 42 OPMDs, 40 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 18 controls.\\nThe sensitivity and specificity for the fluorescein detection method for OPMDs and OSCC was found to be 96.6% and 52.4% respectively. The positive predictive value was 73.7% and the negative predictive value was 91.7% for the fluorescein method. The likelihood ratios stood at 2.03 for a positive test and 0.066 for a negative test.\\nWe conclude that fluorescein staining along with blue light is likely to improve detection of early oral cancers and dysplasia and can play a vital role in mass screening programmes of oral cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are implicated in tumor initiation, development and recurrence after treatment, and have become the center of attention of many studies in the last decades. Therefore, it is important to develop methods to investigate the role of key genes involved in cancer cell stemness. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and mortal types of cancers. Gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) are thought to be the root of gastric cancer relapse, metastasis and drug resistance. Understanding GCSCs\\xa0biology is needed to advance the development of targeted therapies and eventually to reduce mortality among patients. In this protocol, we present an experimental design using a conditional knockdown system and an adapted sphere formation assay to study the effect of clusterin on the stemness of patient-derived GCSCs. The protocol can be easily adapted to study both in vitro and in vivo function of stemness-associated genes in different types of CSCs.  Gastric cancer represents one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide.  Individuals with pathogenic germline variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are at increased risk of developing colorectal, endometrial and other cancers (Lynch syndrome, LS). While previous studies have extensively described cancer risks in LS, cancer risks in individuals from families without detectable MMR gene defects despite MMR deficiency (Lynch-like syndrome, LLS), and in individuals from families fulfilling the Amsterdam-II criteria without any signs of MMR deficiency (familial colorectal cancer type X, FCCX) are less well studied. The aim of this prospective study was to characterise the risk for different cancer types in LS, LLS, and FCCX, and to compare these with the cancer risks in the general population.\\nData was taken from the registry of the German Consortium for Familial Intestinal Cancer, where individuals were followed up prospectively within the framework of an intensified surveillance programme at recommended annual examination intervals. A total of 1120 LS, 594 LLS, and 116 FCCX individuals were analysed. From this total sample, eight different cohorts were defined, in which age-dependent cumulative risks and standardised incidence ratios were calculated regarding the first incident occurrence of any, colorectal, stomach, small bowel, urothelial, female breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer, separately for LS, LLS, and FCCX.\\nThe number of individuals at risk for first incident cancer ranged from 322 to 1102 in LS, 120 to 586 in LLS, and 40 to 116 in FCCX, depending on the cancer type of interest. For most cancer types, higher risks were observed in LS compared to LLS, FCCX, and the general population. Risks for any, colorectal, stomach, urothelial, and endometrial cancer were significantly higher in LLS compared to the general population. No significantly increased risks could be detected in FCCX compared to LLS patients, and the general population. Colorectal and endometrial cancer risks tended to be higher in LLS than in FCCX.\\nThe characterisation of cancer risks in patients with LLS and FCCX is important to develop appropriate surveillance programmes for these specific intermediate risk groups. Larger prospective studies are needed to obtain more precise risk estimates. To investigate the role of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) compared to volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), realised with RapidArc and RapidPlan methods (RA_RP) for neoadjuvant radiotherapy in locally advanced oesophagal cancer.\\nTwenty patients were retrospectively planned for IMPT (with two fields, (IMPT_2F) or with three fields (IMPT_3F)) and RA_RP and the results were compared according to dose-volume metrics. Estimates of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of secondary cancer induction were determined for the lungs. For the cardiac structures, the relative risk (RR) of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) were estimated.\\nBoth the RA_RP and IMPT approached allowed to achieve the required coverage for the gross tumour volume, (GTV) and the clinical and the planning target volumes, CTV and PTV (V\\nWith regard to cancer of the oesophagogastric junction type I and II, the use of intensity-modulated proton therapy seems to have a clear advantage over VMAT. In particular, the reduction of the heart and abdominal structures dose could result in an optimised side effect profile. Furthermore, reduced risk of secondary neoplasia in the lung can be expected in long-term survivors and would be a great gain for cured patients. Gastric carcinoma (GC) ranks fifth in terms of cancer morbidity and third in cancer-related death worldwide and imposes enormous health and economic burdens. The molecular mechanisms underlying GC formation and progression remain unclear. Our aim was to identify the involvement of circular RNA circFOXO3 in GC, and to determine the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we revealed a stimulatory role of circular RNA circFOXO3 in tumor growth in vivo. CircFOXO3 enhanced GC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and promoted tumor growth of GC cells in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that circFOXO3 might regulate USP44 expression by specifically binding to microRNA (miR)-143-3p. Existence of circFOXO3-miR-143-3p-USP44 axis in GC cells was confirmed by RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, and an RNA pull-down experiments. All the data indicate that circFOXO3 promotes GC cell proliferation and migration by upregulating USP44 expression via targeting of miR-143-3p. None Many hereditary disorders in dogs have equivalents in humans and thus attract attention as natural animal models. Breed predisposition to certain diseases often provides promising clues to explore novel hereditary disorders in dogs. Recently, cases of gastrointestinal (GI) polyps in Jack Russell Terriers (JRTs) have increased in Japan. In 21 affected JRTs, polyps were found in either or both the stomach and colorectum, with a predilection for the gastric antrum and rectum. Multiple polyps were found in 13 of 21 examined dogs, including 5 dogs with both gastric and colorectal polyps. Some dogs were found to have GI polyps at an early age, with the youngest case being 2.3 years old. Histopathologically, 43 of 46 GI polyps (93.5%) were diagnosed as adenomas or adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in the tumor cells. As in the case of human patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, all examined JRTs with GI polyps (n=21) harbored the identical heterozygous germline APC mutations, represented by a two-base pair substitution (c.[462A>T; 463A>T]). The latter substitution was a nonsense mutation (p.K155X) resulting in a truncated APC protein, thus suggesting a strong association with this cancer-prone disorder. Somatic mutation and loss of the wild-type APC allele were detected in the GI tumors of JRTs, suggesting that biallelic APC inactivation was involved in tumor development. This study demonstrated that despite differences in the disease conditions between human and dog diseases, germline APC mutation confers a predisposition to GI neoplastic polyps in both dogs and humans. None None None The stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 protects stomach cells, maintains gastric integrity against various noxious agents such as alcohol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and exerts cytoprotection/ adaptive cytoprotection/organoprotection in other epithelia, that is, skin, liver, pancreas, heart, and brain. Especially BPC 157 counteracts gastric endothelial injury that precedes and induces damage to the gastric epithelium and generalizes \"gastric endothelial protection\" to protection of the endothelium of other vessels including thrombosis, prolonged bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. In this background, we put the importance of BPC 157 as a possible way of securing GI safety against NSAIDs-induced gastroenteropathy since still unmet medical needs to mitigate NSAIDs-induced cytotoxicity are urgent. Furthermore, gastrointestinal irritants such as physical or mental stress, NSAIDs administration, surfactants destroyer such as bile acids, alcohol can lead to leaky gut syndrome through increasing epithelial permeability. In this review article, we described the potential rescuing actions of BPC 157 against leaky gut syndrome after NSAIDs administration for the first time. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most appearing mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we are aiming to share the most up to date knowledge about diagnosis and treatment of these tumors by transferring our clinical experience about GISTs.\\nThe 151 patients who were operated between 2006-2020 and whose pathological examination was reported as GIST were analyzed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and pathological features and treatment methods of patients were evaluated.\\nSeeventy-six of the patients were women and 75 of them were men whose age averages were 66.1 (31-86). The most common location was the stomach (55.6%), followed by the small intestine, retroperitoneal, large intestine, rectum, esophagus, and another organ. With surgical intervention, 139 of them had been cured. Twelve of cases were accepted as inoperable. The diameter of tumors in our cases were between 0.4\\xa0cm and 35\\xa0cm. Determined mitotic activity was ≤\\u20095 in 71 patients and 5\\u2009<\\u2009in 80 patients. In 8 of 12 unresectable cases, it has been seen that partial remission after the treatment of 12-month tyrosine kinase inhibitors, C-KIT, was positive in 96.7% of our cases. CD34 and Ki-67 was analyzed in patients. CD34 was found positive in 98 (64.9%) of them, Ki-67 was positive in 82 (54.3%) patients. Patients had been observed for 40\\xa0months.\\nDespite GISTs are not appearing frequently, nowadays they have started to be seen more frequently than before with the growing present-day diagnostic methods. The ideal treatment is performing radical resection without leaving any tumor cells behind. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have an important place in unresectable cases. Digitizing whole-slide imaging in digital pathology has led to the advancement of computer-aided tissue examination using machine learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks. A number of convolutional neural network-based methodologies have been proposed to accurately analyze histopathological images for cancer detection, risk prediction, and cancer subtype classification. Most existing methods have conducted patch-based examinations, due to the extremely large size of histopathological images. However, patches of a small window often do not contain sufficient information or patterns for the tasks of interest. It corresponds that pathologists also examine tissues at various magnification levels, while checking complex morphological patterns in a microscope. We propose a novel multi-task based deep learning model for HIstoPatholOgy (named Deep-Hipo) that takes multi-scale patches simultaneously for accurate histopathological image analysis. Deep-Hipo extracts two patches of the same size in both high and low magnification levels, and captures complex morphological patterns in both large and small receptive fields of a whole-slide image. Deep-Hipo has outperformed the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We assessed the proposed method in various types of whole-slide images of the stomach: well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated, and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma; poorly cohesive carcinoma, including signet-ring cell features; and normal gastric mucosa. The optimally trained model was also applied to histopathological images of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Stomach Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-STAD) and TCGA Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD), which show similar pathological patterns with gastric carcinoma, and the experimental results were clinically verified by a pathologist. The source code of Deep-Hipo is publicly available athttp://dataxlab.org/deep-hipo. Patients with osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have lower cancer-related mortality than the general population. We examined risks of solid cancers at 16 sites in elderly patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (KHOA) or ankylosing spondylitis.\\nIn this population-based retrospective cohort study, we used US Medicare data from 1999 to 2010 to identify cohorts of persons with KHOA or ankylosing spondylitis, and a general population group without either condition, who were followed through 2015. We compared cancer incidence among groups, adjusted for age, sex, race, socioeconomic characteristics, geographic region, smoking and comorbidities.\\nWe studied 2\\xa0701\\xa0782 beneficiaries with KHOA, 13\\xa0044 beneficiaries with ankylosing spondylitis, and 10\\xa0859\\xa0304 beneficiaries in the general population group. Beneficiaries with KHOA had lower risks of cancer of the oropharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon/rectum, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, and ovary than the general population. However, beneficiaries with KHOA had higher risks of melanoma, renal cell cancer, and cancer of the bladder, breast, uterus and prostate. Associations were similar in ankylosing spondylitis, with lower risks of cancer of the oesophagus, stomach, and lung, and higher risks of melanoma, renal cell cancer, and cancer of the renal pelvis/ureter, bladder, breast, and prostate.\\nLower risks of highly prevalent cancers, including colorectal and lung cancer, may explain lower cancer-related mortality in patients with KHOA or ankylosing spondylitis. Similarities in cancer risks between KHOA and AS implicate a common risk factor, possibly chronic NSAID use. Geographical variations in cancer mortality can be explained, in part, by their association with social inequalities. The objective of our study was to analyse the spatial pattern of mortality in relation to the most common causes of cancer in the Spanish autonomous community of Andalusia and its possible association with social inequalities.\\nA small area cross-sectional study in Andalusia, with census tracts as units of spatial analysis, for the period 2002-2013. Cases and person-years, sex and age group came from the Longitudinal Population Database of Andalusia. Standardized mortality rates and smoothed risk ratios were calculated using the Besag, York and Mollié model for lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, bladder and stomach cancer. In order to evaluate the association with social inequalities we included the deprivation index of the census tract as a covariate.\\nThe results show an East-West mortality pattern with higher risk in the west for lung and bladder cancer among men, and breast cancer among women. For all of Andalusia, the association between deprivation index of the census tract and mortality relative risks is positive and significant for lung, stomach and bladder cancers in men, while in women we observed a negative association for lung cancer and a positive for stomach cancer.\\nKnowledge regarding the spatial distribution of cancer mortality and the socioeconomic inequalities related should contribute to the design of specific health and social policies-aimed at tackling cancer mortality and social inequalities in areas of high mortality and/or levels of deprivation. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS) has been\\nrecognized as a rare primary gastric tumor characterized by hepatocellular carcinomalike\\nhistology. HAS often causes diagnostic confusion with conventional gastric\\nadenocarcinoma (CGA) due to the difficulty to detect hepatoid differentiation solely\\nbased on findings from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. β-catenin is highly\\nexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is involved in the maintenance of\\ntumor initiating cells, drug resistance, tumor progression, and metastasis. Due to the\\nscarcity of confirmed cases of HAS, there are few studies on β-catenin.\\n14 patients diagnosed in our hospital were selected.\\nThe clinical characteristics of 14 patients were statistically studied, and\\npathological specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.\\nWe detected statistically significant difference in the expression of β-catenin (P\\n= 0.000), glypican3 (P = 0.019), and hepar-1 (P = 0.007) between HAS cancer tissues\\nand normal tissues. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the\\nexpression of β-catenin in HAS cancer tissue and normal tissue (Pearson correlation\\ncoefficient: 0.686, P = 0.007). Meanwhile, a significant correlation was observed\\nbetween the expression of β-catenin and survival time (Spearman correlation\\ncoefficient= - 0.482, P = 0.003). However, we found the expression of β-catenin did not\\ncorrelate with the tumor differentiation and size, age, gender, serum AFP levels,\\nmicroinvasion, and metastasis (P > 0.05).\\nOur findings establish β-catenin as a useful marker that can distinguish\\nHAS from CGA and may improve the early diagnosis to guide the appropriate and timely\\ntreatment of HAS patients. Proximal gastrectomy has been more advantageous than total gastrectomy in early cancer in the upper third of the stomach. Jejunal interposition is a novel reconstruction technique to prevent reflux esophagitis and anastomotic stricture in proximal gastrectomy. The combination of these two procedures via laparoscopic approach is not yet widespread. Therefore, this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this surgery.\\nThis is a retrospective study on eight patients with laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and jejunal interposition for early proximal gastric cancer. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, and 6\\xa0months and then at 6-month intervals to investigate complications, recurrence, metastasis, and survival.\\nAll cases were adenocarcinoma in the early stage (cT1N0M0). The median (range) operating time and postoperative hospital stay were 145\\xa0min (120-210) and 7\\xa0days (6-9), respectively. No complication (including reflux esophagitis and anastomotic stricture) occurred. All patients were alive without any recurrence or metastasis during the median follow-up of 28\\xa0months (ranged 6-40\\xa0months).\\nLaparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for early gastric cancer is safe and feasible with good long-term outcomes. Further large studies are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this procedure.  Gene mutations play important roles in tumour metastasis, which significantly affect the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) patients. This study aimed to compare lymph node (LN) metastasis of GCs with different microsatellite instability (MSI) statuses and explore the effect of \\nThe association between clinicopathologic characteristics and MSI status or \\nLN metastasis was significantly decreased in MSI-H GCs compared with microsatellite instability-low or microsatellite stable (MSI-L/MSS) GCs (\\nMSI-H GCs had lower LN metastasis partially due to  Addition of trastuzumab to first-line chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic gastric cancer. We assessed the safety and activity of pembrolizumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in first-line HER2-positive metastatic oesophagogastric (gastric, oesophageal, or gastroesophageal junction) cancer.\\nThis study was an investigator-initiated, open-label, non-randomised, single-arm, single centre, phase 2 trial in patients aged 18 years or older with HER2-positive metastatic oesophagogastric cancer. Eligible patients had measurable or evaluable non-measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 53%. Patients were eligible to receive an initial induction cycle of 200 mg flat dose of intravenous pembrolizumab and 8 mg/kg loading dose of intravenous trastuzumab. For subsequent cycles, patients received 130 mg/m\\nBetween Nov 11, 2016, and Jan 23, 2019, 37 patients were enrolled. At the time of data cutoff on Aug 6, 2019, median follow-up among survivors was 13·0 months (IQR 11·7-23·5). The primary endpoint was achieved; 26 (70%; 95% CI 54-83) of 37 patients were progression-free at 6 months. The most common treatment-related adverse event of any grade was neuropathy, which was reported in 36 (97%) of 37 patients. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were lymphocytopenia (seven [19%] patients with grade 3 and two [5%] with grade 4), grade 3 decreased electrolytes (six [16%] patients), and grade 3 anaemia (four [11%] patients). Serious adverse events occurred in two patients patients (both grade 3 nephritis leading to treatment discontinuation). Four patients discontinued pembrolizumab because of immune-related adverse events. There were no treatment-related deaths.\\nPembrolizumab can be safely combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy and has promising activity in HER2-positive metastatic oesophagogastric cancer. A randomised phase 3 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in first-line HER2-positive metastatic oesophagogastric cancer is underway.\\nMerck & Co. None SPARCL1 is a matricellular protein with anti-adhesive, anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic functions and is frequently downregulated in tumors such as colorectal carcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer. Studies have identified SPARCL1 as an angiocrine tumor suppressor secreted by tumor vessel endothelial cells, thereby exerting inhibitory activity on angiogenesis and tumor growth, in colorectal carcinoma. It is unknown whether SPARCL1 may exert these homeostatic functions in all organs and in other species. Therefore, SPARCL1 expression was comparatively analysed between humans and mice in a systematic manner. Murine Sparcl1 (mSparcl1) is most strongly expressed in the lung; expressed at an intermediate level in most organs, including the large intestine; and absent in the liver. In human tissues, SPARCL1 (hSPARCL1) was detected in all organs, with the strongest expression in the stomach, large intestine and lung, mostly consistent with the murine expression pattern. A striking difference between human and murine tissues was the absence of mSparcl1 expression in murine livers, while human livers showed moderate expression. Furthermore, mSparcl1 was predominantly associated with mural cells, whereas hSPARCL1 was detected in both mural and endothelial cells. Human SPARCL1 expression was downregulated in different carcinomas, including lung and colon cancers. In conclusion, this study revealed species-, organ- and cell-type-dependent expression of SPARCL1, suggesting that its function may not be similar between humans and mice. The glucose metabolism of cancer cells differs from that of noncancerous cells. Transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) both play a role in this process. These biochemical tumor markers are overexpressed in several types of human cancer.\\nWe sought to determine if TKTL1 and/or GLUT1 expression predicts prognosis in gastric cancer.\\nIn this retrospective study, we selected 284 patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer at the Helsinki University Hospital. We used immunohistochemistry to assess the expression of TKTL1 and GLUT1, combined with clinicopathological data.\\nPositive expression of TKTL1 was associated with positive expression of GLUT1, age over 65 years, male gender, advanced stage (II-IV), and advanced tumors (T2-T4). Patients with a positive expression of TKTL1 had a poorer prognosis than those with no expression (p = 0.042, Breslow test). GLUT1 positivity was associated with higher age and with the intestinal type of gastric cancer but did not carry any prognostic value.\\nIn conclusion, our study showed that positive expression of TKTL1 correlates with a poor prognosis in gastric cancer. Preoperative induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation yields better R0 resection rates, pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and improved survival for localized gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). We report the effect of three-drug induction chemotherapy on a large cohort of localized GAC patients.\\nWe identified 97 patients with localized GAC who received three-drug induction chemotherapy followed by preoperative chemoradiation therapy. We assessed various endpoints (overall survival [OS], recurrence-free survival [RFS], R0 resection and pCR rate).\\nThe median follow-up time was 3.5 years (range; 0.4-16.7). The induction chemotherapy regimen was a fluoropyrimidine and a platinum compound (cisplatin or oxaliplatin) with a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) for 95% of patients. Seventy-three (75.3%) out of 97 patients underwent planned surgery. R0 resection and pCR rae were 93.2 and 20.6%, respectively. Pathologic partial response (<50% residual carcinoma) rate was 50.7%. The median OS was 6.4 years (95% Cl 3.3-12.4) for the entire cohort and 11.1 years (95% Cl 7.1-not estimable) for patients that underwent surgery. The estimated 2- and 5-year OS rates were 72.4% (95% CI 62.1-80.3) and 54.3% (95% CI 43.2-64.1) for the entire cohort and 83.2% (95% CI 72.3--90.1) and 66% (95% CI 52.3-75.8) for patients that underwent surgery. Pathologic lesser stage (stage I/II vs. stage III/IV) (p = 0.001) and R0 resection (p = 0.02) were independently associated with longer RFS in the multivariate analysis.\\nOur data shows that three-drug combination is feasible without providing substantial advantage compared with two-drug combination in this setting of preoperative induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgery. The hospitalizations are part of cancer care and has been studied by researchers worldwide. A better understanding about their associated factors may help to achieve improvements on this area. The aims of this study were to investigate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and hospitalizations, as well as between these characteristics and the length of stay (LOS), within the first year of outpatient treatment, for the most incident cancers in the Brazilian population. In this cohort study, we investigated 417,477 patients aged 19 years or more, who started outpatient cancer treatment, from 2010-2014, for breast, prostate, colorectal, cervix, lung and stomach cancers. The outcomes evaluated were: i) Hospitalizations within the first year of outpatient cancer treatment; and ii) LOS of the hospitalized patients. It was performed a binary logistic regression to evaluate the association between the explanatory variables and the hospitalizations and a negative binomial regression to evaluate their influence on the length of hospital stay. The hospitalizations occurred for 34% of patients, with a median of LOS of 6 days (IQR: 2-15). Female patients were 16% less likely to be hospitalized (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.82-0.86), with lower average of LOS (AR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97-0.99), each additional year of age reduced in 2% the hospitalization odds (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99) and in 1% the average of LOS (AR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99), patients from South region had twice more chances of hospitalization than from North region (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.93-2.10) and patients with colorectal cancer had greater probability of hospitalization (OR: 4.42; 95% CI: 4.27-4.48), with the highest average of LOS (AR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.35-1.40). In view of our results, we consider that the government must expand the policies with potential to reduce the number of hospitalizations. Intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma arises in a field of pre-existing metaplasia. While biomarkers of cancer and metaplasia have been identified, the definition of dysplastic transition as a critical point in the evolution of cancer has remained obscure. We have evaluated Trop2 as a putative marker of the transition from metaplasia to dysplasia in the stomach in multiple mouse models of metaplasia induction and progression. In addition, TROP2 expression was evaluated in human samples by immunostaining tissue microarrays for metaplasia, dysplasia, and gastric cancer. Dysplastic mouse organoids were evaluated in vitro following shRNA knockdown of Trop2 expression. In mouse models, no Trop2 was observed in the normal corpus and Trop2 was not induced in acute models of metaplasia induction with either L635 or DMP-777. In Mist1-Kras mice, Trop2 expression was not observed in metaplasia at 1\\u2009month after Kras induction, but was observed in dysplastic glands at 3-4 months after Kras induction. In human tissues, no Trop2 was observed in normal corpus mucosa or SPEM, but Trop2 expression was observed in incomplete intestinal metaplasia, with significantly less expression in complete intestinal metaplasia. Trop2 expression was observed in all dysplastic and 84% of gastric cancer lesions, although expression levels were variable. Dysplastic mouse organoids from Mist1-Kras mice expressed Trop2 strongly. Knockdown of Trop2 with shRNA markedly reduced organoid growth and budding behavior, and induced the upregulation of apical villin expression. We conclude that Trop2 is upregulated in the transition to dysplasia in the stomach and promotes dysplastic cell behaviors. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Serous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a rare but well-established entity. The origin and evolution of this disorder remain unclear, but even metastatic cases have an excellent prognosis. These tumors are very similar to benign serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) of the pancreas, except that they tend to be larger, are locally invasive, and present distant metastasis. The most frequent local invasion is adjacent vessels, spleen, stomach, and duodenum. The most common site of distant metastasis is the liver. Diagnosis via imaging as well as pathology examination may be misguided due to atypical characteristics of the tumor. In fact, in some, the diagnosis of malignancy was established only after metastases were detected. We present a 60-year-old female patient with malignant serous microcystic cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas and liver metastasis that was initially misdiagnosed as a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The patient underwent tumor resection and liver metastasectomy and she is currently doing well after three years of follow-up, with no tumor recurrence or new metastatic liver nodules based on imaging findings. To study the effect of lncRNA HAND2-AS1 on gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) cell property and explore its specific mechanism.\\nData on stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were analyzed to screen differentially expressed lncRNA HAND2-AS1. RNA22-HAS database and dual luciferase reporter assay were applied to confirm the target relationship between HAND2-AS1/HIF3A and miR-184. The HAND2-AS1 and miR-184 expressions in tissue or cells were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Besides, after GA cells (AGS) cultured in normoxic and hypoxic condition, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and lactic acid were quantified by Phosphoenolpyruvate Fluorometric Assay Kit and Lactic Acid Detection kit, respectively. Additionally, colony formation assay, transwell invasion and migration assays were used to evaluate the abilities of cell invasion, migration, and proliferation in distinct conditions.\\nThe HAND2-AS1 and HIF3A expressions were down-regulated and miR-184 expression was up-regulated in GA tissues and cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed HAND2-AS1 and HIF3A were targeted by miR-184. AGS cell proliferation abilities were restrained by HAND2-AS1 and HIF3A overexpression and enhanced by miR-184, as well as migration and invasion abilities. In addition, HAND2-AS1 rescued enhanced AGS cell proliferation, cell migration, cell invasion abilities and glycolytic process caused by hypoxia via miR-184/HIF3A.\\nLncRNA HAND2-AS1 could inhibit GA cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities and glycolytic process induced by hypoxia through miR-184/HIF3A signaling. During laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG), it is necessary to manipulate the lateral segment of the liver to secure the surgical field. Liver retraction during surgery often causes liver dysfunction after LG. However, no previous studies have used preoperative image evaluations to predict postoperative liver damage associated with surgical retraction. We aimed to predict postoperative liver damage after LG.\\nIn all, 117 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent LG were included in this study. Using preoperative computed tomography (CT), the volume of the stomach overlapping the liver was integrated and calculated as the liver projecting stomach volume (LPSV). The liver projection ratio (LPR) was calculated by dividing the LPSV by the volume of the whole stomach. The relationships among liver damage, the LPSV and LPR were evaluated.\\nA total of 112 patients were divided into two groups as follows: 33 patients in the liver dysfunction group (D group) and 79 patients in the non-dysfunction group (N group). The LPSV was significantly larger in the D group than in the N group (median 77.1 vs 50.1 cm\\nWe have developed a novel technique for predicting postoperative liver damage associated with surgical liver retraction following LG. This method confirms the degree of the LPSV and LPR of the stomach via preoperative CT. In clinical practice, various devices are implanted into the body for medical reasons. As X-ray fluoroscopy is necessary to visualize medical devices implanted into the body, the development of a less-invasive visualization method is highly desired. This study aimed to investigate the clinical applicability of our novel solid material that emits near-infrared fluorescence.\\nWe developed a solid resin material that emits near-infrared fluorescence. This material incorporates a near-infrared fluorescent pigment, with quantum yield\\u2009≥\\u200920 times than that of indocyanine green. It can be sterilized for medical treatment. This resin material is designed to be molded into a catheter and inserted into the body with an endoscope clip. In this preclinical experiment using a swine model, the resin material was embedded into the body of the swine and visualized with a near-infrared fluorescence camera system.\\nEndoscopic clips were placed in the mucosa of the stomach, esophagus, and large intestine, and the indwelling ureteral catheters were successfully visualized by near-infrared fluorescence laparoscopy.\\nWe confirmed the tissue permeability of the fluorescence emitted by our novel near-infrared fluorescent material and the possibility of its clinical application. This material may allow visualization of devices embedded in the body. Our current understanding of lipoprotein synthesis and localization in Gram-negative bacteria is based primarily on studies of  Nivolumab is recommended as a third-line treatment in patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer. Although recent studies have demonstrated the prognostic impact of salvage chemotherapy after immune checkpoint inhibitors in several malignancies, its clinical significance remains unclear in patients with gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate tumor response to subsequent chemotherapy after nivolumab in patients with advanced gastric cancer and assess the prognostic effect of salvage chemotherapy.\\nWe retrospectively enrolled 31 patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer receiving nivolumab.\\nTwenty-two and nine patients received nivolumab as third-line and fourth- to sixth-line treatments, respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) to nivolumab were 20.0% (4/20) and 55.0% (11/20), respectively. Eleven patients received salvage chemotherapy after nivolumab. The ORR and DCR to salvage chemotherapy were 37.5% (3/8) and 75.0% (6/8), respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival following salvage chemotherapy were 285 and 360 days, respectively.\\nOur preliminary study indicates that nivolumab exposure may enhance subsequent chemosensitivity in patients with advanced gastric cancer. None An 82-year-old man who had previously undergone a proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition surgery for stomach cancer was transferred to our hospital for massive hematemesis and hypotension. His electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in lead ΙΙ, ΙΙΙ, aVF, which confirmed inferior myocardial infarction. Due to active hematemesis, upper endoscopy was performed initially. A visible vessel of gastric ulceration was discovered, and hemostasis was achieved using hemoclips. Subsequently, coronary angiography was performed since the right coronary artery (RCA) segment 4 atrioventricular (AV) was occluded. After thrombectomy and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), 2.0\\u2009mm balloon angioplasty was done, and coronary perforation occurred. During coronary angiography, extravasation of the contrast material into the gastrointestinal cavity was noted. A covered stent was placed across segment 3 to segment 4 descending posteriorly (PD) to stop the blood supply to the perforation site of segment 4 AV. After stenting, adequate re-hemostasis was achieved. The patient was discharged after 28\\u2009days. This is the first report of a coronary artery perforation into the gastrointestinal cavity. We conducted a survey to investigate to what extent the fear of COVID-19 has influenced the patients decision to undergo or to cancel endoscopic procedures. We collected data from 847 patients from 13 centres. The main indication for endoscopy was anemia, followed by pain and unexplained weight loss. The percentage of not presenters progressively increased throughout the three weeks of study, from 15.1% at the beginning to 48.2% at the end. 37 (34.2%) upper GI endoscopies and 112 (56.3 %) colonoscopies showed an organic cause explaining the symptoms presented by the patients, respectively; 5 cases of gastric cancer (4.6%) and 16 cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) (6.0%), respectively, were detected; during the second week the percentage of organic diseases found at upper endoscopy was 19 (33.3%) with 5 cancer (8.7%), and 61 (49.1% ) at colonoscopy, with 2 CRC (1.6%); finally, during the third week the corresponding figures were 19 (48.7%) for upper GI examinations, with 3 gastric cancers (7.7%), and 43 (60.5%) with 4 (6.5%) CRC cases found.We conclude that patients weighted the fear of having a clinically relevant disease with the fear of becoming infected by coronavirus, and a relevant percentage of them (29.4%) decided not to attend the endoscopy suites at the scheduled date. None None To establish and validate a model to determine the progression risk of gastric low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN).\\nA total of 705 patients with gastric LGIN at the endoscopy center of Jiangsu Provincial People\\'s Hospital during January 2010 and August 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Basic clinical and pathological information were recorded. According to the time sequence of the initial examination, the first 605 patients were enrolled in the derivation group, and the remaining 100 patients were used in the validation group. SPSS 19 software was used as statistical analysis to determine independent risk factors for progression of LGIN of the stomach and to establish a risk model. The ROC was used to verify the application value of the predictive model.\\nUnivariate and multivariate analysis suggested that sex, multiple location, congestion, ulceration and form were independent risk factors for prolonged or advanced progression in patients with LGIN. Based on this, a predictive model is constructed: P\\u2009=\\u2009ex/(1\\u2009+\\u2009ex) X\\u2009=\\u2009-\\xa010.399\\u2009+\\u20090.922\\xa0×\\xa0Sex\\u2009+\\u20091.934\\xa0×\\xa0Multiple Location\\u2009+\\u20091.382\\xa0×\\xa0Congestion\\u2009+\\u20090.797\\xa0×\\xa0Ulceration\\u2009+\\u20090.525\\xa0×\\xa0Form. The higher of the P value means the higher risk of progression. The AUC of the derivation group and validation group were 0.784 and 0.766, respectively.\\nSex, multi-site, hyperemia, ulcer and morphology are independent risk factors for the prolongation or progression of patients with gastric LGIN. These factors are objective and easy to obtain data. Based on this, a predictive model is constructed, which can be used in management of patients. The model can be used to identify high-risk groups in patients with LGIN that may progress to gastric cancer. Strengthening follow-up or endoscopic treatment to improve the detection rate of early cancer or reduce the incidence of gastric cancer can provide a reliable basis for the treatment of LGIN. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide and kills more Americans than 59 other infections, including HIV and tuberculosis, combined. While direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments are effective, limited uptake of therapy, particularly in high-risk groups, remains a substantial barrier to eliminating HCV. We developed a long-acting DAA system (LA-DAAS) capable of prolonged dosing and explored its cost-effectiveness. We designed a retrievable coil-shaped LA-DAAS compatible with nasogastric tube administration and the capacity to encapsulate and release gram levels of drugs while resident in the stomach. We formulated DAAs in drug-polymer pills and studied the release kinetics for 1 mo in vitro and in vivo in a swine model. The LA-DAAS was equipped with ethanol and temperature sensors linked via Bluetooth to a phone application to provide patient engagement. We then performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing LA-DAAS to DAA alone in various patient groups, including people who inject drugs. Tunable release kinetics of DAAs was enabled for 1 mo with drug-polymer pills in vitro, and the LA-DAAS safely and successfully provided at least month-long release of sofosbuvir in vivo. Temperature and alcohol sensors could interface with external sources for at least 1 mo. The LA-DAAS was cost-effective compared to DAA therapy alone in all groups considered (base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $39,800). We believe that the LA-DAA system can provide a cost-effective and patient-centric method for HCV treatment, including in high-risk populations who are currently undertreated. This study evaluated the possibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer with papillary adenocarcinoma (EGC-PAC). PAC, an uncommon pathologic type of stomach cancer, is classified into differentiated-type histology. However, aggressive features, including a high rate of submucosal invasion, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and lymph node metastasis (LNM), have been reported in studies with surgical specimens. Treatment outcomes of ESD for EGC-PAC have not been precisely demonstrated. Core databases were sought for the following inclusion criteria: studies of endoscopic resection or surgery of EGC-PAC presenting the following therapeutic indicators; en bloc resection, complete resection, curative resection, recurrence, complications associated with procedures, LVI, or LNM that enabled an analysis of ESD possibility. Overall, 15 studies were included for systematic review. Frequent submucosal invasion and high LVI were noted in EGC-PAC. However, PAC was not significantly associated with LNM. Pooled en bloc resection, complete resection, and curative resection rates were 89.7% (95% confidence interval: 55.3%-98.4%), 85.3% (67.7%-94.2%), and 67% (43%-84.5%), respectively. No LNM was observed if EGC-PAC satisfied the curative resection criteria. ESD seems technically feasible, although a high LVI rate results in a lower rate of curative resection. Glomus tumors (GTs) are rare neoplasms that originate from the modified smooth muscle cells of glomus bodies and occasionally arise from visceral primary sites. All previously reported primary hepatic GTs were benign. Here we report the first malignant primary hepatic GT.\\nOur patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with weight loss, early satiety, night sweats, and abdominal distention. Imaging demonstrated a large mass abutting the stomach, duodenum, and head of the pancreas, exerting mass effect on the portal vein and inferior vena cava. Biopsy results were deemed nondiagnostic after extensive review at multiple academic institutions. We performed a caudate lobe resection, antrectomy, and Bilroth II gastrojejunostomy that required skeletonization of much of the periportal vascular anatomy and the repair of multiple venotomies due to the tumor\\'s adherence to the inferior vena cava. Histopathologic evaluation revealed morphologic and immunohistochemical findings consistent with a malignant GT, and next-generation sequencing using a targeted panel revealed an inactivating TP53 mutation.\\nThis case presented both a surgical and histopathologic challenge, requiring meticulous operative technique for resection in conjunction with a combination of characteristic morphologic features and immunohistochemical staining for diagnosis. Sequencing results using a targeted panel add to the limited GT genomic literature.\\nWhile rare, it is important to consider malignant GTs in the differential diagnosis for heterogeneous liver masses. Close follow-up will be essential to monitor our patient\\'s clinical course and expeditiously pursue any further interventions. High-quality randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the benefit of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with radical resected gastric cancer (GC), however, utilization rates of postoperative RT remain remarkably low. Patterns, incidences, and time of recurrence provide biological bases for clinical monitoring of GC patients and guiding potential complementary therapies. Thus, the aim of this study is to understand the location of locoregional recurrence which may allow individualized RT strategies and minimize radiation-related toxic effects.\\nA relatively large sample of GC patients in a single institution who had undergone curative D2 resection was retrospectively reviewed and the relevant recurrence patterns were illustrated. Independent recurrence-related risk factors were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. New logistic regression models were further developed to predict the probability of recurrence.\\nOverall, among 776 GC patients who had continuous and complete follow-up data, 300 cases relapsed after curative resection. Lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastases, and tumor stage were indicators for early recurrence. Peritoneal, regional, local, and distant recurrence initially occurred in 51 (6.6%), 151 (19.4%), 56 (7.2%), and 164 (21.1%) patients, respectively. Among patients with regional recurrence, the most common sites were lymph node stations 16a2, 8, 12, 16b1, and 9. Remnant stomach recurrence was not so prominent that it seemed reasonable to be excluded from an irradiation field for patients with negative surgical/pathologic margins.\\nFor GC patients who underwent radical D2 resection, distant and regional recurrences were still common. Besides, optimizing regional control of lymph nodes outside the D2 dissected area was crucial for rational design of the RT field. Furthermore, the new logistic regression models might act as useful tools to evaluate recurrence risk and determine which patients should receive postoperative chemoradiotherapy. None None None The monopolar spindle one binder (MOB) protein, a key signal transducer of the Hippo signaling pathway, is involved in growth control and cancer. In this study, a new MOB kinase activator-like 1 of the oriental river prawns, Macrobrachium nipponense, (MnMOB1) was isolated and characterized. The open reading frame of MnMOB1 consisted of 651 nucleotides that encoded 216 amino acid residues and contained the Mob1_phocein domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MnMOB1 clustered together with the MOB1 from Penaeus vannamei. The distribution of MnMOB1 expression in various tissues of normal prawn revealed that the MnMOB1 expression was highest in the hepatopancreas followed by those in the intestines, gill, heart, stomach, and hemocytes. In prawns challenged with Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the expression levels of MnMOB1 in the hepatopancreas, gills, and intestine were upregulated. Furthermore, the expression levels of crustins and anti-lipopolysaccharide factors in prawn injected with S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus and MnMOB1 knockdown were significantly decreased relative to those in the control group. These findings indicated that MnMOB1 is involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide expression and plays a crucial role in the innate immunity of M. nipponense. None None Increasing evidence indicates that aberrantly expressed microRNAs play a role in tumorigenesis and progression of gastric cancer. Recently, a novel cancer-related microRNA, miR-621, was found to be involved in cancer pathogenesis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic activity of miR-621 remain unclear and require further investigation. In the current study, we demonstrate that miR-621 expression is downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines, and its reduction is associated with malignant clinical features including tumor size, lymph node metastasis, tumor-node-metastasis stage and poor prognosis. Functional studies involving gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that miR-621 represses cell viability, colony formation, cell cycle progression and proliferation in vitro, and miR-621 overexpression inhibited tumor growth in a gastric cancer xenograft model. SYF2 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-621 in gastric cancer. MiR-621 directly interacts with the SYF2 3\\'-UTR and post-transcriptionally repressed SYF2 expression in gastric cancer cells. SYF2 was significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and negatively correlated with miR-621 expression. Moreover, inhibition of SYF2 expression reversed the effects of miR-621 loss in gastric cancer cells. SYF2 overexpression was similar to that induced by miR-621 loss in gastric cancer. Taken together, these studies suggest that miR-621 may be a viable therapeutic target in gastric cancer. Workshops on \"Innovative Therapeutic Endoscopy\" for upper gastrointestinal tract diseases were held four times as the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopic Society (JGES) Core Sessions at the 93rd to 96th Biannual Meetings of the JGES. A total of 48 research presentations (including two invited lectures) were reported, and various discussions were held on these topics. When the research presentations were categorized according to the therapeutic procedure, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was the most frequent with 28 presentations (58.3%), followed by laparoscopy endoscopy cooperative surgery (LECS) with six presentations (12.5%). When the research presentations were classified by the target organ of the therapeutic procedures, the duodenum was the most frequent with 26 presentations (54.1%), followed by the stomach with 13 presentations (27.1%). The most important issue was the establishment of a safe and reliable endoscopic resection method for duodenal lesions. Issues related to gastric ESD were establishing an efficient traction method and a method to prevent post-ESD bleeding in high-risk patients. Other important issues were establishment of an efficient traction method and methods of preventing delayed bleeding in high-risk patients who undergo gastric ESD, expansion of indications for minimally invasive treatment using LECS for gastric cancer, the development of endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) for gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs), and improvement of per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) for esophageal achalasia and per-oral endoscopic tumor resection (POET) for esophageal SMTs. Through the JGES Core Sessions, it is expected that the minimally invasive treatments using endoscopes developed in Japan will be further advanced. Many systematic reviews have been published to evaluate the clinical benefits of robotic surgery for gastric cancer. However, these reviews have investigated various outcomes and differ considerably in quality. In this overview, we summarize the findings and quality of these reviews. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses that compared robotic surgery with laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer. We summarized the results of the meta-analyses and evaluated the quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR-2 tool. The literature search identified 14 eligible reviews. The reviews showed that estimated blood loss was significantly less and time to resumption of oral intake was significantly shorter in patients who underwent robotic surgery than in those who underwent laparoscopic surgery. However, no significant differences in other outcomes were found between the two types of surgery. The quality of the included reviews was judged to be critically low. In conclusion, the available evidence, albeit of critically low quality, suggests that robotic surgery decreases estimated blood loss and shortens the time to resumption of oral intake in patients with gastric cancer. There is currently no high-quality evidence that robotic surgery has clinical benefits for gastric cancer patients. Patients with metastatic gastric cancer have poor survival outcomes and may experience high symptom burden. We evaluated symptom trajectory and risk factors for increased symptom severity among metastatic gastric cancer patients during the last 6\\xa0months of life.\\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients ≥\\u200918\\xa0years diagnosed with metastatic gastric cancer from January 2007 to December 2014 in the province of Ontario, Canada. We included patients who died during the study period and who reported at least one Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) score during the last 6\\xa0months of life. We described the proportion of patients who reported moderate-to-severe symptom scores (≥\\u20094) by month. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to identify risk factors for moderate-to-severe symptom scores.\\nSeven hundred eighty-eight eligible patients with 3286 unique symptom scores completed during their last 6\\xa0months of life were identified. The highest prevalence of moderate-to-severe scores was observed for tiredness and lack of appetite, while nausea and depression had the lowest prevalence of elevated scores. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe was consistently high for all symptoms, particularly approaching end-of-life. Timing of ESAS scores, receipt of cancer-directed therapy, urban residence, and female sex were associated with increased odds of reporting moderate-to-severe symptom scores.\\nPatients with metastatic gastric cancer experience significant symptom burden at the end-of-life. Routine screening with patient-reported outcome tools may assist in shared decision-making and effective palliative care by ensuring patients\\' health status and supportive care needs are identified promptly at the time of clinical encounters. The space radiation environment is composed of ionizing particles that may pose health risks to crew members during Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and deep space missions. NASA has established astronaut career radiation limits for cancer of 3% Risk of Exposure Induced Death (REID) at the 95% confidence level. The REID is the increased lifetime risk of death from cancer due to radiation exposure in comparison to an unexposed background population and has been traditionally mitigated by passive shielding design concepts and limiting safe days in space. Additional reduction in radiation exposure risk may be achieved with Medical Countermeasures (MCM). Recent meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of aspirin in the reduction of the background colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates for specific cohorts. Additional studies of warfarin in patients greater than 50 years of age have indicated statistically significant decreases in stomach, bladder, brain, prostate, and lung cancer incidence as compared to control groups. While ultimate selection of suitable countermeasures will be the responsibility of flight surgeons, this paper presents a general methodology for incorporating MCM into the NASA Space Radiation Cancer Risk model and includes modifications of the background mortality rates (hazard rates) and the radiation risk coefficients to numerically quantify the benefits of MCM. As examples of the method, aspirin and warfarin will be employed as MCM in a sensitivity analysis to compute the REID for astronauts embarking on a one-year deep space mission scenario. To study the expression of aldo-keto reductase 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) in gastric carcinoma (GC), the correlation between AKR1B1 and the clinicopathological characteristics of GC patients, and provide reference for the diagnosis and prognosis of GC patients. One hundred thirty-six patients with GC were collected, and the expression level of AKR1B1 in GC and adjacent tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry assays. The clinicopathological features and prognosis of GC patients were collected to analyze the relationship with AKR1B1 expression. The positive expression of AKR1B1 in GC tissues was significantly higher than that of adjacent nontumor tissues. The difference of AKR1B1 expression between GC tissues and paired adjacent nontumor tissues was statistically significant ( Dietary factors may affect the prognosis of digestive tract cancer, but evidence has been sparse. We investigated the association between pretreatment intake of 6 Japanese foods (including soy food, miso [soybean paste] soup and seaweed) and the risk of death among patients with histologically confirmed major digestive tract cancers (stomach, 1931; colon, 793; rectum, 510) diagnosed during 1997-2013 at a single institution in Japan. Pretreatment dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and the patients were followed until December 2016. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among the patients with stomach cancer, frequent intake of soy food was inversely associated with the risk of all-cause (P We evaluated the changes in body composition (BC) and quality of life (QoL) in patients who underwent gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer.\\nBC data using segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis and QoL data from the EORTC (European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer) gathered via QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 questionnaires were obtained from 300 patients preoperatively and at 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery. In total, 114 patients underwent total gastrectomy (TG group) and 186 underwent distal gastrectomy (DG group).\\nAccording to BC analysis, at 3 years postoperatively, the average body weight (P = 0.002), protein mass (P = 0.028), body fat mass (P = 0.009), skeletal muscle mass (P = 0.037), and visceral fat area (P = 0.012) was significantly decreased in the TG group than in the DG group compared to the preoperative. In the QLQ-C30, physical functioning (P = 0.001), role functioning (P = 0.013), and fatigue (P = 0.005) showed significantly worse QoL in the TG group than in the DG group at 2 and 3 years postoperatively. In the QLQ-STO22, pain (P = 0.001), reflux symptoms (P = 0.009), eating restrictions (P = 0.001), anxiety (P = 0.008), taste (P = 0.011), and body image (P = 0.014) showed greater continuous deterioration postoperatively in the TG group than in the DG group.\\nPersistent deterioration of BC and QoL is a serious concern following total gastrectomy. Long-term management of BC is required after gastrectomy and efforts should be made to improve the QoL in patients as soon as possible, postoperatively. Proximal gastrectomy is used for the treatment of primary gastric cancer by open or laparoscopic surgery in the upper third of the stomach. Esophagogastrostomy (EG) or jejunal interposition (JI) is widely used in various reconstruction methods after proximal gastrectomy. We conducted a meta-analysis of EG and JI for treatment of gastric cancer.\\nA search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, J-STAGE, and Cochrane Library identified retrospective series on EG and JI. Weight mean differences (WMDs), odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to analyze the operation-related data and postoperative complications. Heterogeneity was evaluated by the \\nEight studies were selected, and 496 patients were included. EG group benefits were 44.81\\u2009min shorter operating time (\\nThe results of our study indicated that EG has significant advantages during the perioperative period and in short-term outcomes compared to JI. Studies on morbid obesity have shown remarkable improvement of diabetes in patients who have undergone bariatric operations. It was subsequently shown that these operations induce diabetes remission independent of the resultant weight loss; as a result, surgeons began to investigate whether operations for gastric cancer (GC) could have the same beneficial effect on diabetes as bariatric operations. It was then shown in multiple reports that followed that certain operations for GC were able to improve or even cure type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in GC patients. This finding gave rise to the concept of \"oncometabolic surgery\", in which a patient diagnosed with both GC and T2DM undergo a single operation with the purpose of treating both diseases. With the increasing incidence of T2DM, oncometabolic surgery has the potential to improve the quality of life and even extend survival of many GC patients. However, because the GC patient population and the bariatric patient population are wildly different and because different GC operations have different properties, the effect of oncometabolic surgery must be carefully assessed and engineered in order to maximize benefit and avoid harm. This manuscript aims to summarize the findings made so far in the field of oncometabolic surgery and to provide an outlook regarding the possibility of oncometabolic surgery being incorporated into standard clinical practice. To summarize the cancer burden and trends in China, compare the differences among China, Japan, and South Korea and discuss possible causes of the disparities.\\nIncidence and mortality data were extracted from the online cancer database including the GLOBOCAN 2018 and the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Trend analysis was conducted using the join-point analysis, and annual percent changes were calculated.\\nCancers resulted in approximately 62.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in China in 2017. Lung cancer had the greatest contribution, followed by liver cancer, stomach cancer, and esophageal cancer. The trajectory of progress in the reduction of liver and stomach cancers was observed in China. However, China still faced a heavy burden of lung cancer and a growing burden of cancers related to westernized lifestyle such as colorectal cancer, while Japan and South Korea have achieved reductions in colorectal cancer and lung cancer, respectively. Besides, China had a lower age-standardized cancer incidence rate but higher cancer mortality and DALY rates than Japan and South Korea.\\nChina is in the cancer transition stage with a rising burden of colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers along with a heavy burden of lung and upper digestive tract cancers. Taking into consideration the effectiveness of screening and tobacco control in Japan and South Korea, improvement in the current tobacco control policy and cancer screening systems may contribute to cancer control in China. This study aims to investigate how Maspin affects the EMT and angiogenesis of gastric cancer (GC) cells via ITGB1/FAK pathway. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expressions of Maspin, ITGB1, FAK, E-cadherin, Vimentin, D2-40, and CD34 in GC and adjacent normal tissues from 160 patients. Then, the human GC cells with different degree of differentiation were transfected with Maspin CRISPR activation plasmid, ITGB1 siRNA and/or Maspin siRNA, followed by the following experiments, including qRT-PCR, western blotting, tube formation assay, Transwell assay and wound healing. GC tumor tissues manifested decreased Maspin with the activated ITGB1/FAK pathway. In tumor tissues, Maspin was negatively correlated with the expressions of ITGB1 and FAK, as well as Lauren\\'s classification, differentiation degree, and TNM stage. Besides, Maspin was negatively related with lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and microvessel density (MVD), Vimentin and VEGF, but was positive correlated with E-cadherin. Maspin expression decreased, but ITGB1 and p-FAK expressions increased gradually in MKN-28 (well differentiated), SGC-7901 (moderate differentiated), and MKN-45 (poorly differentiated). Maspin CRISPR and ITGB1 siRNA increased E-cadherin with the decreased Vimentin, VEGF and bFGF, and the reductions of tube length. In comparison with the ITGB1 siRNA group, cells in the Maspin siRNA\\u2009+\\u2009ITGB1 siRNA group presented the more evident EMT and angiogenesis. Furthermore, ITGB1 siRNA reduced the malignancies of GC cells, which could be restored by Maspin siRNA. Maspin was downregulated in GC tissues, which could inhibit the EMT and angiogenesis by blocking the ITGB1/FAK pathway, thereby decreasing cell invasion and migration of GC. Preoperative chemoradiation is a potential treatment option for localized gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). Currently, the response to chemoradiation cannot be predicted. We analyzed the pretreatment maximum standardized uptake value (SUV\\nWe analyzed the SUV\\nTwenty-nine patients (49%) had Siewert type III adenocarcinoma and 30 (51%) had tumors located in the lower stomach. Forty-one patients had poorly differentiated GAC, and 26 had signet ring cells. The median SUV BACKGROUND\\u2002: The International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) consensus guideline advises prophylactic gastrectomy in early adulthood to prevent gastric cancer development in  The patient was a 52-year-old woman, who was found to have an abnormality in the upper gastrointestinal(UGI)tract, via a contrast-imaging study; she had no symptoms.Computed tomography(CT)revealed a tumor, measuring approximately 100mm in diameter, in the antrum of the stomach.The tumor was diagnosed as gastric schwannoma using endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration(EUS-FNA).Preoperative CT revealed multiple lymph adenopathies around the antrum, which led to the suspicion of lymph node metastasis. The patient underwent a laparoscopic partial gastrectomy after the confirmation of the absence of lymph node metastasis by intraoperative rapid diagnosis. A 74-year-old man with upper abdominal pain and anorexia was referred to our hospital in December 2013. Based on computed tomography(CT)and gastroendoscopy findings, the patient was diagnosed as having advanced gastric cancer with multiple liver metastases(S3, S5, and S6 lesions). Because of high pyloric stenosis, distal gastrectomy Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed in mid-December 2013. Histopathological findings of the patient were L, Ant-Gre, 35×60 mm, type 2, pT4a(SE), tub2>tub1, int, INF b, ly2, v1(VB), pPM0(95mm), pDM0(15mm), pN0(0/2), HER2(IHC 3+). Postop- eratively, the patient received combined S-1/trastuzumab chemotherapy toward the end of January 2014. The clinical response was PR after 2 courses and clinical CR(cCR)after 4 courses. Because hand-foot syndrome caused by S-1 was prolonged, the dosage was completed in 11 courses. He remains alive 4.5 years after surgery without recurrence. Although ToGA examination showed that trastuzumab was effective for HER 2-positive unresectable gastric cancer, few reported cases showed progression to cCR after the treatment followed by a regimen of trastuzumab without CDDP, and they had good prognosis. Furthermore, in this case, the liver metastases showed complete response without CDDP. Thus, trastuzumab might be a chemotherapy option for patients who have difficulty using platinum analogs, including the elderly patients. A 50s man was diagnosed with esophagogastric junction cancer. Simultaneously, PET-CT demonstrated mediastinal lymph node metastases. Two months later, 4 courses of systemic chemotherapy(SOX)were provided as preoperative therapy. However, the outcome was PD; therefore, radical gastrectomy could not be performed. Two more months later, esophageal dysphagia developed. Mediastinal lymph nodes that compressed the esophagus and the primary lesion of the cardia were considered to be the causes of dysphagia, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization targeting those 2 lesions was performed. Cisplatin 20 mg, docetaxel 20 mg, and 5-FU 250mg were the drugs administered. These drugs were injected from the right bronchial artery, left gastric artery, and left phrenic artery, followed by mild embolization with HepaSphereTM. The mediastinal lymph nodes shrunk significantly, and dysphagia improved with 2 sessions. The primary lesion was found to have reduced in size with 6 sessions. Currently, no regrowth of the mediastinal lymph nodes has been observed 16 months(9 sessions) after the first session, and control of the primary lesion has been obtained. Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide due to its poor prognosis. DNA methylation changes, as an early event during tumor progression, constitute attractive markers for cancer diagnostics. In the current study, CD40 DNA methylation was investigated in GC as a novel epigenetic biomarker.\\nWe first analyzed DNA methylation microarrays from the Gene Expression Omnibus database on GC samples to evaluate the potential diagnostic value of CD40 methylation. Moreover, using q-MSP, in a set of internal samples including GC primary tumors and adjacent normal specimens, CD40 DNA methylation levels were determined. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on GC was also analyzed for further validation.\\nOur results illustrated significant CD40 hypermethylation in GC samples compared to normal specimens which was significantly correlated with the clinical stage of malignancy. Besides, the high accuracy of CD40 methylation as a diagnostic biomarker in GC was confirmed using the ROC curve analysis with an AUC value of 0.9089. Also, gene set enrichment analysis showed that CD40 is mainly involved in biological processes regulating immune response activation in GC. Further analysis of other prevalent cancer entities in TCGA showed that CD40 hypermethylation is a common event during tumor progression and could be considered as a potential biomarker for the detection of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers as well.\\nThe finding of this study suggests that CD40 methylation as a potential pan biomarker could be a valuable target for liquid biopsy application of human cancers. The potential of physical activity (PA) to attenuate the effects of alcohol consumption on the risks of alcohol-related cancer mortality is unknown. We used data from participants aged 30\\u2009years and over in 10 British population-based surveys (Health Surveys for England 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2008 and the Scottish Health Surveys 1998 and 2003). Alcohol-related cancer mortality included oral cavity, throat, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectal, stomach and female breast (conservative definition), and additionally pancreas and lung (broad definition). Alcohol consumption was categorised into six groups based on the UK units/week: (a) never-drinkers, (b) ex-drinkers, (c) occasional drinkers, (d) within guidelines (<14 UK units/week [women]; <21 UK units/week [men]), (e) hazardous (14-35 [women]; 21-49 [men]) and (f) harmful (>35 [women]; >49 [men]). PA was categorised using two dichotomous classifications based on the lower (7.5 Metabolic Equivalent Task [MET]-hours/week) and upper (15 MET-hours/week) recommended limits. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we found a strong direct association between alcohol consumption and mortality risk of alcohol-related cancers, with a significantly higher risk among ex-drinkers (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.09, 1.94]), drinkers who consumed hazardous (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = [1.06, 1.83]) and harmful amounts of alcohol (HR = 1.62, 95% CI = [1.13, 2.30]) compared to never-drinkers in the fully adjusted model. The increased mortality risks were substantially attenuated when participants in these drinking groups exercised >7.5 MET-hours/week. PA could be promoted as an adjunct risk minimisation measure for alcohol-related cancer prevention. Objectives This report describes the extended follow-up (1941-2015) of a cohort of 38 549 automobile manufacturing workers with potential exposure to metalworking fluids (MWF). The outcomes of interest were mortality from cancers of the esophagus, stomach, intestine, rectum, bladder, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, skin, prostate, brain, and female breast, as well as leukemia. This report includes 5472 deaths from cancer, more than ten times the numbers of deaths in our last summary report published 20 years ago. Methods Standardized mortality ratios were computed for the entire study period. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated in Cox proportional hazard models with categorical variables for cumulative exposure to each type of MWF. Results Exposure-response patterns are consistent with prior mortality reports from this cohort. We found increased risk of skin and female breast cancer with straight fluids. For the first time, we found elevated risk of stomach cancer mortality. Overall, many of the exposure-response results did not suggest an association with MWF. Conclusions Mortality is a poor proxy for cancer diagnosis for treatable cancers and not the optimal outcome measure in etiological studies. Although the HR presented here handle bias from the healthy worker hire effect and left truncation, they do not handle bias from healthy worker survivor effect, which likely results in underestimates of the health impacts of MWF. Although this updated summary provides some information on the risk of cancer from MWF, targeted future analyses will help clarify associations. Curative treatment for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) cancers, involves complex surgical resection often in combination with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemo/chemoradiotherapy. With advancing survival rates, there is an emergent cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors with physical and nutritional deficits, resultant from both the cancer and its treatments. Therefore, rehabilitation to counteract these impairments is required to maximise health related quality of life (HRQOL) in survivorship. The initial feasibility of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for UGI survivors was established in the Rehabilitation Strategies following Oesophago-gastric Cancer (ReStOre) feasibility study and pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). ReStOre II will now further investigate the efficacy of that programme as it applies to a wider cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors, namely survivors of cancer of the oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, and liver.\\nThe ReStOre II RCT will compare a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme of supervised and self-managed exercise, dietary counselling, and education to standard survivorship care in a cohort of UGI and HPB cancer survivors who are >\\u20093-months post-oesophagectomy/ gastrectomy/ pancreaticoduodenectomy, or major liver resection. One hundred twenty participants (60 per study arm) will be recruited to establish a mean increase in the primary outcome (cardiorespiratory fitness) of 3.5\\u2009ml/min/kg with 90% power, 5% significance allowing for 20% drop out. Study outcomes of physical function, body composition, nutritional status, HRQOL, and fatigue will be measured at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and 3-months follow-up (T2). At 1-year follow-up (T3), HRQOL alone will be measured. The impact of ReStOre II on well-being will be examined qualitatively with focus groups/interviews (T1, T2). Bio-samples will be collected from T0-T2 to establish a national UGI and HPB cancer survivorship biobank. The cost effectiveness of ReStOre II will also be analysed.\\nThis RCT will investigate the efficacy of a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for survivors of UGI and HPB cancer compared to standard survivorship care. If effective, ReStOre II will provide an exemplar model of rehabilitation for UGI and HPB cancer survivors.\\nThe study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number: NCT03958019, date registered: 21/05/2019. Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, despite declining incidence of the disease in the United States. Because of the rare occurrence of the disease in the United States, there is significant treatment variance in use of diagnostic modalities, neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies, and surgical techniques. The survival of patients with gastric cancer in the United States is significantly lower than those of Asian countries where the diagnosis is made at an earlier stage and uniform high-quality treatment is delivered. This article reviews pearls and pitfalls of multidisciplinary management of the gastric adenocarcinoma for best outcomes. For most individuals, cancer development is multifactorial; however, up to 10% of all cancers are related to an inherited genetic mutation. As health care shifts to having a greater emphasis on prevention, care providers, including general surgeons, will need to play a role in identifying patients at high risk for cancer development. Genetic testing provides a tool to determine those patients with a genetic mutation and to whom appropriate preventive care and treatment may be offered. It is imperative for general surgeons to understand the role genetics plays in the care of individual patients and their relatives. The presence of lymph node (LN) metastases is one of the most important negative prognostic factors in upper gastrointestinal carcinomas. Tumour regression similar to that in primary tumours can be observed in LN metastases after neoadjuvant therapy. We evaluated the prognostic impact of histological regression in LNs in 480 adenocarcinomas of the stomach and gastro-oesophageal junction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Regressive changes in LNs (nodular and/or hyaline fibrosis, sheets of foamy histiocytes or acellular mucin) were assessed by histology. In total, regressive changes were observed in 128 of 480 patients. LNs were categorised according to the absence or presence of both residual tumour and regressive changes (LN-/+ and Reg-/+). 139 cases were LN-/Reg-, 28 cases without viable LN metastases revealed regressive changes (LN-/Reg+), 100 of 313 cases with LN metastases showed regressive changes (LN+/Reg+), and 213 of 313 metastatic LN had no signs of regression (LN+/Reg-). Overall, LN/Reg categorisation correlated with overall survival with the best prognosis for LN-/Reg- and the worst prognosis for LN+/Reg- (p <\\u20090.001). LN-/Reg+ cases had a nearly significant better outcome than LN+/Reg+ (p =\\u20090.054) and the latter had a significantly better prognosis than LN+/Reg- (p =\\u20090.01). The LN/Reg categorisation was also an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (HR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.1-1.38; p <\\u20090.001). We conclude that the presence of regressive changes after neoadjuvant treatment in LNs and LN metastases of gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction cancers is a relevant prognostic factor. Gastric carcinoma is one of the most lethal malignant tumors. As part of our long-term efforts on seeking effective diagnosis and therapeutic strategies of gastric cancer, we present herein novel ternary copper-based chalcogenide nanoplatform CuS-NiS In the purpose of identifying reliable biomarkers for evaluating prognosis, monitoring recurrence and exploring new therapeutic targets, it is quite necessary to screen for the genetic changes and potential molecular mechanisms of the occurrence and development of gastric cancer (GC) from the aspects of race and region.\\nTarget datasets were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with \"gastric cancer\" as the key word, and corresponding data was downloaded. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by using limma R package, and the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway for DEGs were analyzed in Enirchr database. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and molecular module were also constructed through STRING database and Cytoscape software. Survival analyses were completed for DEGs in GEO and Kaplan-Meier plotter database via cross validation. Finally, the correlation between gene expression and the infiltration cell levels in tumor microenvironment (TME) was explored based on the tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER) database.\\nFive GC-related microarray datasets were selected and used for differential analysis, and 222 DEGs were identiﬁed. GO analyses of DEGs were mainly involved in cell metabolism and the formation of extracellular matrix (ECM). The top enriched pathways of DEGs were protein digestion and absorption, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion (FA), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Survival analyses of DEGs revealed that the expression levels of  Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare, autosomal-dominantly inherited cancer predisposition caused in approximately 50% of cases by pathogenic germline variants in SMAD4 and BMPR1A. We aimed to gather detailed clinical and molecular genetic information on JPS disease expression to provide a basis for management guidelines and establish open access variant databases.\\nWe performed a retrospective, questionnaire-based European multicenter survey on and established a cohort of SMAD4/BMPR1A pathogenic variant carriers from the medical literature.\\nWe analyzed questionnaire-based data on 221 JPS patients (126 kindreds) from ten European centers and retrieved literature-based information on 473 patients. Compared with BMPR1A carriers, SMAD4 carriers displayed anemia twice as often (58% vs. 26%), and exclusively showed overlap symptoms with hemorrhagic telangiectasia (32%) and an increased prevalence (39% vs. 13%) of gastric juvenile polyps. Cancer, reported in 15% of JPS patients (median age 41 years), mainly occurred in the colorectum (overall: 62%, SMAD4: 58%, BMPR1A: 88%) and the stomach (overall: 21%; SMAD4: 27%, BMPR1A: 0%).\\nThis comprehensive retrospective study on genotype-phenotype correlations in 694 JPS patients corroborates previous observations on JPS in general and SMAD4 carriers in particular, facilitates recommendations for clinical management, and provides the basis for open access variant SMAD4 and BMPR1A databases. The patient was a 76-year-old man with advanced gastric cancer who had a history of coronary artery bypass grafting using the right gastroepiploic artery. Although coronary angiography confirmed the patency of all the coronary artery bypass grafts, his right gastroepiploic artery was required to be cut for curative gastrectomy. To prevent serious myocardial ischemia, rerouting of the right gastroepiploic artery graft was performed using a saphenous vein graft via right mini-thoracotomy. The proximal end of the saphenous vein graft was anastomosed to the ascending aorta. Then, gastrectomy via epigastric median re-laparotomy was performed. His postoperative course was uneventful. Laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer is feasible but less commonly performed compared to laparoscopic distal gastrectomy due to technical difficulties such as reconstruction. There is no standard esophagojejunal anastomosis technique in laparoscopic total gastrectomy due to a lack of evidence.\\nWe retrospectively analyzed data from 213 patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy from October 2012 to December 2016. Of these, 109 and 104 patients underwent esophagojejunostomy with linear and circular stapling, respectively. We compared short-term postoperative outcomes, including surgical complications and anastomosis costs between both groups.\\nThe mean operation time in the linear stapler group was longer than the circular stapler group (Linear stapler, 235.3\\u2009±\\u200957.9 vs. Circular stapler, 217.1\\u2009±\\u200955.8\\u2009min; P\\u2009=\\u20090.021); however, D2 lymph node dissection was performed more in the linear stapler group (Linear stapler, 36.7% vs. Circular stapler, 23.1%; P\\u2009=\\u20090.030). There were two anastomosis leakages in each group (Linear stapler, 1.8% vs. Circular stapler, 1.9%; P\\u2009>\\u20090.999). Anastomosis stenosis only occurred in the circular stapler group (Linear stapler, 0% vs. Circular stapler, 7.7%; P\\u2009=\\u20090.003). Although the linear stapling technique used more stapler cartridges (Linear stapler, 7.6\\u2009±\\u20091.1 vs. Circular stapler, 4.8\\u2009±\\u20090.9; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), costs related to anastomosis were lower in the linear stapler group (Linear stapler, 1,904,679\\u2009±\\u2009342,116 vs. Circular stapler, 2,246,150\\u2009±\\u2009427,136KRW; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001).\\nEsophagojejunostomy with the linear stapling technique reduces anastomosis stenosis in laparoscopic total gastrectomy. It can be recommended as a safe and more cost-effective method for esophagojejunal anastomosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as the subtype of non-coding RNAs are revealed to be crucial players in cellular activities. It has been reported that miR-3619-5p functions as a tumor inhibitor in several cancers. However, the connection between miR-3619-5p and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains to be discovered.\\nThe purpose of the study is to figure out the role and molecular regulation mechanism of miR-3619-5p in STAD.\\nThe expression of miR-3619-5p was evaluated via qRT-PCR analysis. Gain-of-function experiments demonstrated the effects of miR-3619-5p on cellular functions. The upper-stream transcription factor STAT4 and downstream target gene TBC1D10B of miR-3619-5p were identified by bioinformatic analysis. The binding and interaction between the indicated molecules were verified by RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays.\\nThe expression of miR-3619-5p was prominently down-regulated in STAD cells and tissues. MiR-3619-5p suppresses cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth in STAD. Further, STAT4 bound with miR-3619-5p promoter and inhibited its transcription. MiR-3619-5p was also recognized to modulate STAD progression through the regulation of downstream target gene TBC1D10B.\\nSTAT4-mediated miR-3619-5p controls STAD carcinogenesis and progression through modulating TBC1D10B expression, which may provide a novel insight for researching the STAD-related molecular mechanism. Inflammation is a fundamental process for defending against foreign antigens that involves various transcriptional regulatory processes as well as molecular signaling pathways. Despite its protective roles in the human body, the activation of inflammation may also convey various diseases including autoimmune disease and cancer.  Although microsatellite instability (MSI) is a powerful predictive biomarker for the efficacy of immunotherapy, the mechanism of MSI in sporadic gastrointestinal cancer is not fully understood. However, epigenetics, particularly microRNAs, has been suggested as one of the main regulators that contribute to the MSI formation.\\nWe used microRNA expression data of 386 gastric adenocarcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to identify differential microRNA expression profiles by different MSI status. We also obtained putative common target genes of the top differential microRNAs with miRanda online tools, and we analyzed these data by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment (KEGG).\\nWe found that 56 and 67 gastric adenocarcinoma samples were positive for low and high MSI, respectively, and that a high MSI status was associated with age, sex and subregion (P=0.049, 0.014 and 0.007, respectively). In the 67 samples with a high MSI status, expression levels of 14 microRNAs were upregulated but five microRNAs were downregulated as assessed by the fold change (FC), compared with that of the 56 samples with a low MSI status (P<0.05, |FC| >2). Further analysis suggested that the expression of miR-210-3p, miR-582-3p, miR-30a-3p and miR-105-5p predicted a high MSI status (P=4.93×10\\nMiR-30a-3p and miR-105-5p are potential biomarkers for the MSI-H gastric adenocarcinoma, possibly by altering expression of DNA damage-repair genes. Gastric cancer that mimics a submucosal tumor (SMT) is infrequently encountered in routine clinical settings, and histopathological analysis is often negative for malignant cells. In such cases, excisional biopsy of the entire tumor may be necessary to make a definitive pathological diagnosis, and laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) is a viable method of excisional biopsy.\\nAn 80-year-old male patient diagnosed with stomach wall irregularities at routine medical check-up was referred to our facility, and consequent endoscopic examination detected a 20-mm protruded lesion in the greater curvature at the middle third of the stomach. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a thick, low echoic lesion with an irregular margin in the second layer of the gastric wall. Further, a nodular part of the lesion had infiltrated into the submucosa, with an appearance similar to that of linitis plastica of the stomach. The lesion was highly suspected to be a gastric carcinoma with submucosal invasion. However, mucosal-incision-assisted biopsy revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) identified no metastatic lymph nodes. Therefore, an excisional biopsy using LECS was performed, and to avoid peritoneal dissemination, we used a modified version, namely, combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET). The procedure ended without any complications, and post-operative course was uneventful. As histopathology returned a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma pT4a, we performed radical gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy. Post-operative course was unremarkable and the patient underwent follow-up examinations without adjuvant chemotherapy because of old age.\\nLocal resection using LECS for gastric tumors with a high suspicion of malignancy is useful and feasible. LECS could be used in similar cases.  报道1例食管黏膜下腺导管腺瘤。肿瘤发生在食管-胃连接部，位于黏膜下层。组织学形态表现为含双层上皮细胞的导管，呈腺丛状、囊状分布。导管上皮细胞增生成多层，形成乳头状、微腺体状结构。瘤细胞温和/或轻度异型，未见核分裂象。间质内淋巴组织丰富，见淋巴滤泡形成。病理医师可能认识不足，容易漏诊、误诊。.   We aimed to evaluate site-specific cancer risk in diabetic patients and to investigate causal and temporal relationships by analyzing organ-specific cancer risk according to the duration of diabetes.\\nUsing a database provided by the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of adults aged ≥ 30 years from January 2005 to December 2013. To verify the possibility of detection bias or reverse causation, we compared hazard ratios (HRs) for each cancer according to the following duration of diabetes: less than 6 months, 6 months to 3 years, and more than 3 years.\\nThe incidence of overall cancer per 1,000 person-years was higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes (20.36 vs. 10.83). The overall cancer risk according to the duration of diabetes was the highest within the first 6 months after diagnosis (HR, 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.99 to 2.07), and the HR decreased with the duration of diabetes, ranging from 1.19 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.21) between 6 months and 3 years to 1.12 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.13) after 3 years. Both overall cancer risk and HR remained significantly higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. The risk for prostate cancer was higher in men with diabetes than in those without diabetes (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.14). In women, the risk for endometrial cancer was significantly higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes throughout the duration of diabetes.\\nThe risk for stomach, colorectum, liver, pancreas, and kidney cancer appeared to be higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes regardless of the sex or duration of diabetes. None None Gastrointestinal stromal tumors(GISTs) are rare neoplasms of the gastrointestinal(GI) system originating from the mesenchyme. GISTs mostly develop in the stomach and small intestine. We present here a case of jejunal GIST which is the rarest subtype. A 54-year-old man presented with lower right side abdominal pain. On workup, images showed a 7cm solid-cycstic lesion adjacent to ascending colon. On surgical exploration, a large jejunal tumor en bloc resected and jejuno-jejunal primary anastomosis was performed. Pathologic results showed a 9cm jejunal GIST with 5% proliferation index. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated high expressions of CD117, whereas CD34 negative. The patient was discharged uneventfully. GISTs should be considered in patients with abdominal pain. The mainstay treatment of the jejunal GIST is complete surgical resection. The definitive diagnosis of GISTs is by immunohistochemical stains. KEY WORDS: GIST, Stromal tumor, Jejunum.\\nI tumori stromali gastrointestinali (GIST) sono rare neoplasie del sistema gastroenterico (GI) originate dal mesenchima. I GIST si sviluppano principalmente nello stomaco e nell’intestino tenue. Presentiamo qui un caso di GIST digiunale che è il sottotipo più raro. Un uomo di 54 anni presentava dolore addominale nella parte inferiore destra. Allo studio le immagini hanno mostrato una lesione cistica solida di 7 cm adiacente al colon ascendente. All’esplorazione chirurgica, è stato resecato un grande tumore digiunale in blocco e è stata eseguita l’anastomosi primaria digiuno-digiunale. I risultati istopatologici hanno mostrato un GIST di 9 cm con un indice di proliferazione del 5%. I risultati di immunoistochimica hanno dimostrato alte espressioni di CD117, mentre CD34 negativo. Il paziente è stato dimesso senza incidenti. I GIST devono essere considerati in pazienti con dolore addominale. Il trattamento principale del GIST digiunale è la resezione chirurgica completa. La diagnosi definitiva di GIST è mediante colorazioni immunoistochimiche. Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody inhibitor of programmed death-1(PD-1), was approved for use in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had been previously treated with B2 chemotherapy regimens in Japan.\\nWe investigated the efficacy of nivolumab therapy in 15 consecutive patients with advanced gastric cancer between October 2017 and December 2018 in our facility.\\nIn our study, the 6-month overall survival rate was 67.7%, and the median survival time(MST)was 6.3 months. Immune-related adverse events(irAEs)occurred in the following patients: 2 patients, interstitial pneumonia(13%); 1 patient, myocarditis (6.7%); 1 patient, hypothyroidism(6.7%); and 1 patient, liver dysfunction(6.7%). Of the patients with an absolute lym- phocyte count(ALC)of C2,000/mL at baseline, 33%(4/12)experienced irAEs, while of those with an ALC of >2,000/mL, 67% had irAEs. The 6-month overall survival rate was better in patients with an ALC >1,600/mL(100%, 4/4)than in those with an ALC of C1,600/mL(35%, 4/11). The 6-month overall survival rate of the patients with a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio(NLR)of <4 was 63%, which was better than the 33% rate in those with an NLR of B4.\\nNivolumab therapy was a safe and feasible treatment option. The cutoff values of ALC of 2,000/mL for irAEs and of ALC of 1,600/mL and NLR of 4 for prognosis might be effective surrogate markers in nivolumab treatment. We performed laparoscopic partial resection of the stomach with a trans-gastric wall approach for submucosal tumors. Case 1: A 67-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of tarry stool. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a well demarcated, round, 45mm intraluminal-type submucosal tumor with delle on the anterior wall of the gastric upper body. Case 2: An 86-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of anemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a well demarcated, round, 25mm intraluminal-type submucosal tumor on the posterior wall of the gastric upper body. Laparoscopic partial resection of the stomach with a trans-gastric wall approach was performed. The operation times were 58 minutes and 73 minutes, respectively, and blood loss was low in both cases. This operative procedure is safe and easy and allows for resection resected with a direct view for surgeons without endoscopists. A 66-year-old man underwent chemotherapy with S-1 plus cisplatin plus trastuzumab to treat advanced gastric cancer that was diagnosed as cStage Ⅳ adenocarcinoma(T3N1M1[P0, CYX, H1]). After 8 courses, liver metastases were absent on contrast-enhanced MRI. The patient underwent a laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. The gross appearance of the surgically resected specimen showed a shrunk gastric tumor measuring 1 mm. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient has been well, receiving maintenance chemotherapy of S-1 plus trastuzumab without evidence of recurrence for 15 months following the operation. Conversion surgery following chemotherapy might be an effective treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer; however, further studies are needed to establish this treatment strategy. Palliative care delivered to cancer patients late in the course of disease are inadequate to improve advance care planning and quality of life; thus, early palliative care is recommended. We retrospectively analyzed early palliative care delivered to patients with gastric cancer.\\nForty-nine gastric cancer patients who underwent surgery and had received interdisciplinary care from the first visit(early palliative care)were assessed for physical and psychosocial symptoms.\\nAll patients were followed up continuously by a nurse certified in palliative care support to provide quality patient-centered care from the beginning(advance care planning). Four patients had experienced relapse, and 3 older patients had decided not to receive chemotherapy following their advance care planning. However, all 4 patients were admitted to a palliative care unit without barriers.\\nEarly palliative care might lead patients to have advance care planning, and a better quality of life. A man in his 60s who had epigastric pain was referred to our hospital and diagnosed with advanced type 3 gastric cancer with multiple liver metastases, cT4acN2cN1(H1), cStage Ⅳ(HER2 3+). He underwent chemotherapy using capecitabine, cisplatin(CDDP), and trastuzumab(T-mab)(XPT). After 7 courses of XPT and 23 courses of XT, liver metastases disappeared, and we decided to perform open distal gastrectomy, D2+ #18 lymphadenectomy, and Billroth Ⅰ reconstruction as a conversion surgery. Despite adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 plus T-mab, multiple lymph nodes recurrence occurred 3 months after the surgery. He was found to be in complete remission as assessed by CT after 5 courses of second-line CPT-11 treatment, which was discontinued after 17 courses. The patient is alive without recurrence at 57 months after the initial treatment and 22 months after the last treatment. We report the case of a 68-year-old male with EGJ cancer, who was treated with palliative radiotherapy for persistent bleeding, and for whom, pCR was ultimately obtained by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was planned to treat the EGJ cancer with intramural metastasis of the esophagus, but anemia due to persistent bleeding from the tumor was noted. Even with frequent blood transfusions, the anemia was difficult to control. Palliative radiotherapy was performed at 30 Gy/10 Fr for hemostasis, followed by chemotherapy. After approximately 9 months of chemotherapy, reduction of the primary tumor, a metastatic lymph node, and disappearance of the intramural metastasis of the esophagus were noted, and conversion surgery was performed. In the final histopathological examination, pCR was obtained. Radiotherapy for persistent bleeding from advanced gastric cancer is a minimally invasive treatment, and therefore could be an effective treatment to enable chemother- apy without any loss of compliance. A 60-year-old man underwent surgical distal gastrectomy 10 years prior to receiving treatment for stomach cancer. He visited our hospital with complaints of abdominal fullness and weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography(CT)revealed intestinal blockage starting at the duodenum near the Treitz ligament. During upper alimentary canal endoscopy, a type 2 tumor coveringthe entire circumference of the horizontal duodenum was found, and biopsy results indicated that the tumor was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Although no distant metastasis was observed in the abdominal CT scan, multiple attached bulky lymph nodes were observed leadingto a suspicion of metastasis. Finally, the patient was diagnosed as having progressive duodenal cancer accompanied with advanced lymph node metastasis. A gastrojejunal bypass surgery with laparoscopy was performed. When the patient\\'s overall condition improved, mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy was started, and 6 courses were completed. As the sizes of the primary tumor and bulky lymph nodes decreased, surgery to completely remove the cancer was performed. UFT/UZEL supplemental postoperative chemotherapy was administered for 6 months. The patient remained alive, with no remissions 3 years post-surgery. As a part of community screening, a 64-year-old man underwent gastric fluoroscopy, which revealed abnormalities indicative of a type 3 tumor. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed advanced gastric cancer with multiple regional lymph nodes and liver metastases. Chemotherapy was initiated, and after completion of 2 courses of capecitabine (Cape)and oxaliplatin(OHP)therapy, a distalgastrectomy was performed. The response to chemotherapy was Grade 2, and the lymph node status was pN1(1/17). The patient was strongly positive for HER2; thus, 4 courses of Cape, OHP, and trastuzumab(T-mab)therapy were administered for the metastatic liver lesions, and the liver metastases shrank markedly. S5 subsegmentectomy and S7 partial resection were performed subsequently, and pathological analysis showed completely necrotic tissue. Remarkable progress has been made in chemotherapy for gastric cancer, and the use of T-mab in combination is extremely effective for gastric cancer that is strongly positive for HER2. In our patient, we resected the primary lesion and liver metastatic lesions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The metastatic lesion showed complete response(CR). Metastases and recurrences can even occur in patients with primary and/or metastatic lesions who show a CR. Furthermore, whether cancers that are strongly positive for HER2 are recurrent remains unknown. The patient is alive and recurrence-free after having undergone a hepatectomy. An 82-year-old woman presented with a dull feeling in her stomach and anemia. The gastroscopy and abdominal CT scan showed a progressive gastric tumor with multiple liver metastases, and a biopsy specimen revealed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. A subtotal gastrectomy with D1 plus lymph node dissection was performed. The final diagnosis was as follows: H1, P0, CY0, M1, pT3, pN2, and fStageⅣ. We considered her age, and postoperative chemotherapy with of an oral anticancer drug, S-1, was initiated at a daily dose of 100 mg, with a 2-week administration and 1-week suspension schedule. The multiple liver metastases obviously reduced in size(PR)by 3 months, and the CT scan revealed complete response(CR)by 8 months after beginning S-1 administration. However, grade 2 anorexia and general malaise developed, so the S-1 administration was changed to a daily dose of 80 mg, with a 2-week administration and 2-week suspension schedule. However, an adverse event of nausea appeared again, and the patient needed a 2-month discontinuation. Therefore, S-1 administration was changed to alternate-day administration, at a daily dose of 100 mg. Subsequently, no side effects were observed, and we continued the S-1 administration for 4 years. She has maintained a complete response(CR) for 10 years, with no obvious cancer recurrence. Radical surgery is the mainstay for the treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, the results are still not satisfactory. Various kind of perioperative chemotherapy has been evaluated to improve the therapeutic results. In Japan, adjuvant chemotherapy is regarded as a standard treatment. Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines have recommended the adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 for 1 year in patients with pStageⅡor Ⅲgastric cancer. Meanwhile, the efficacy of S-1 plus docetaxel has been demonstrated in Stage Ⅲ gastric cancer, and it is recommended as a standard treatment for Stage Ⅲ gastric cancer in the guidelines. On the contrary, neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC)is regarded as a standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer in the West. The FLOT regimen is recommended for patients with good performance status. As the patient background and operative results are significantly different between the West and the East, extrapolation of the Western evidences seems to be difficult. We have to establish our own evidence of NAC. Endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD)has been established as a standard treatment for early gastric cancer with low possibility of lymph node metastasis. Based on the results of the multicenter prospective study(JCOG0607), expanded indication for differentiated-type gastric cancer in Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines 2014 changed to absolute indication in Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines 2018. The other multicenter prospective study(JCOG1009/1010)will reveal the longterm outcomes of ESD for undifferentiated-type gastric cancer. With the advance of an aging society in Japan, the indication and curability of early gastric cancer for elderly patients should be discussed in the future. A 15-mm whitish, depressed lesion was observed in the stomach of a 39-year-old using screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The lesion had grown to a size of 40mm and had a cobblestone-like appearance at an 11-year endoscopic follow-up. Using endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) as a diagnostic therapy, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma with MALT translocation gene 1 without Helicobacter pylori infection was detected. Although the patient did not undergo additional treatments, he remained alive without for recurrence 5 years after ESD. Endoscopic therapy is used commonly for superficial gastric cancer with very low risk of metastasis to the lymph nodes. However, limited population-based studies from the West have evaluated long-term outcomes of patients who received endoscopic therapy vs surgery.\\nWe used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database to identify and compare features and outcomes of patients who underwent endoscopic therapy (n\\xa0= 786) or surgery (n\\xa0= 2577) for Tis or T1aN0M0 superficial gastric cancer, diagnosed from 1998 to 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with endoscopic therapy. Overall survival and gastric cancer-specific survival times were compared after we controlled for covariates.\\nUse of endoscopic therapy increased from 15.1% of cases in 1998 to 2000 to 39.0% of cases in 2013 to 2014. Endoscopic therapy was used more frequently in patients who were older, female, or Caucasian, or with lesions that were located in the proximal stomach or were limited in depth (Tis vs T1a) and size, compared with surgery. The median follow-up time was 59 months (interquartile range, 31-102 mo). Percentages of 5-year overall and cancer-specific survival were 57% and 99% in the endoscopic therapy group and 76% and 95% in the surgery group. After we adjusted for clinical factors using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, we found no significant difference in gastric cancer-specific mortality between patients who received endoscopic therapy vs surgery (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.91-2.23; P\\xa0= .12).\\nIn an analysis of a large population database, we found an increased trend in endoscopic therapy for superficial gastric cancer compared with surgery from 1998 through 2014. Patients who received endoscopic therapy vs surgery had comparable long-term cancer-specific mortality. The most prevalent gastrointestinal (GI) cancers include colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, and liver cancer, known as the most common causes of cancer-related death in both men and women populations in the world. Traditional therapeutic approaches, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have failed in the effective treatment of cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need for finding new effective anticancer agents. The available evidence and also the promising results of using bacteria as the anticancer agents on numerous cancer cell lines have attracted the attention of scientists for the therapeutic role of bacteria in the field of cancer therapy. Moreover, several studies on the bacteriotherapy agents have used genetic engineering to overcome the challenges and enhance the efficacy with the least drawbacks. Numerous bacterial species that can specifically target and internalize into the tumor cells are used live, attenuated, or genetically as compared to selectively consider the hypoxic condition of tumor, which results in the tumor suppression. The present study is a comprehensive review of the current literature on the use of bacteria and their substances such as bacteriocins and toxins in the treatment of different types of gastrointestinal cancers. None Gastric cancer (GC), particularly unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent GC, has been characterized by unfavorable prognosis. This meta-analysis of clinical randomized phase II trials was conducted to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine-based versus S-1-based chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent GC.\\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases to identify studies eligible for the present analysis. Data were collected from inception to June 20th, 2019. Outcomes included objective response rate (ORR); 6-, 12-, and 18-month progression-free survival (PFS); 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival (OS); and adverse events. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine whether the results of the meta-analysis were robust. Risk ratio (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported as the main evaluation parameters.\\nSix eligible studies with 561 subjects were included in the present meta-analysis. There was no significant difference between S-1-based and capecitabine-based chemotherapy in ORR (RR =1.17, 95% CI: 0.95-1.44, P=0.13, I2 =0%); 6-month (HR =0.94, 95% CI: 0.77-1.14, I2 =0%), 12-month (HR =0.89, 95% CI: 0.61-1.31, I2 =0%), and 18-month PFS (HR =1.02, 95% CI: 0.55-1.91, I2 =0%); 1-year (HR =0.99, 95% CI: 0.83-1.18, I2 =0%), 2-year (HR =0.90, 95% CI: 0.58-1.42, I2 =0%), and 3-year OS (HR =1.08, 95% CI: 0.50-2.34, I2 =0%). However, the capecitabine-based chemotherapy had a higher incidence in all grades of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (RR =3.41, 95% CI: 1.98-5.90, P<0.01, I 2 =39%) and grades 3-4 neutropenia (RR =1.62, 95% CI: 1.05-2.51, P=0.03, I2 =0%).\\nIn terms of efficacy, capecitabine-based chemotherapy and S-1-based chemotherapy had similar short-term outcomes. Regarding safety, we recommend S-1-based chemotherapy for patients with metastatic or recurrent GC prior to capecitabine-based treatment. Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for advanced stage gastric cancer (GC) patients, and developing chemoresistance is a tremendous challenge to efficacy of GC treatment. The treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents recruit more tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) in GC cells is activated upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and results in much more accumulation of M2-type TAMs which protect tumor cells from chemo-agents. Mechanistically, in the GC cells under the 5-FU treatment, reactive oxygen species is accumulated and then induces the activation of HIF1α signaling to drive the expression of high-mobility group box 1, which leads to more macrophage\\'s infiltration into GC tumor. In turn, the recruited TAMs exhibit tumor-protected M2-type phenotype and promote the chemoresistance of GC cells via producing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) to exacerbate the fatty acid β-oxidation in tumor cells. Blocking GDF15 using antibody or inhibiting FAO of tumor cells by etomoxir efficiently gave rise to the tumor cell sensitivity to 5-FU. Therefore, our study demonstrates a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune microenvironment and provides new therapeutic targets for clinic treatments of gastric cancer. Gastroesophageal cancers are a major cause of death worldwide and treatment outcomes remain poor. Adequate predictive biomarkers have not been identified. Microsatellite instability (MSI) as a result of mismatch repair deficiency is present in four to twenty percent of gastroesophageal cancers and has been associated with favorable survival outcomes compared to microsatellite stable tumors. This prognostic advantage may be related to immunosurveillance, which may also explain the favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibition observed in MSI high (MSI-H) tumors. The value of conventional cytotoxic treatment in MSI-H tumors is unclear and results on its efficacy range from detrimental to beneficial effects. Here the recent data on MSI as a predictive factor for outcome of gastroesophageal cancer treatment is reviewed. The stomach displays large anatomical changes in size, shape and position, which implies the need for plan adaptation for gastric cancer patients who receive pre-operative radiotherapy. We evaluated the feasibility and necessity of a CBCT-guided library of plans (LoP) strategy in gastric cancer radiotherapy.\\nEight gastric cancer patients treated with 24-25 fractions of single-plan radiotherapy with daily CBCT imaging were included. The target was delineated on the pre-treatment CT and first 5 CBCTs to create a patient-specific LoP. Plan selections were performed by 12 observers in a training stage (2-3 CBCTs per patient) and an assessment stage (17 CBCTs per patient). The observers were asked to select the smallest plan that encompassed the target on the CBCT. A total of 136 plan selections were evaluated in the assessment stage.\\nDelineations on CBCTs showed that in 90% of the 40 delineated fractions part of the CTV was outside the PTV based on the pre-treatment CT. At least two-thirds of the observers agreed on the selected plan in 65.2% and 70% of the fractions in the training stage and the assessment stage, respectively. For each patient, at least two different plans from the LoP were the most selected plan.\\nA CBCT-guided patient-specific LoP strategy is feasible for gastric cancer patients, yielding good agreement in plan selections. Unless generous margins are used to avoid frequent geometric misses, it is likely that part of the target will be missed with single-plan radiotherapy. 幽门螺杆菌( Remifentanil is the most frequently prescribed opioid for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or balanced anesthesia (BA), due to its favorable pharmacological properties. However, several studies have reported opioid-induced hyperalgesia and/or acute tolerance after intraoperatively using remifentanil. In addition, it is imperative to control postoperative pain with lower doses of opioid anesthetic agents. Therefore, we compared the amount of opioid consumption between TIVA with propofol-remifentanil and BA with desflurane-remifentanil, to control postoperative pain in patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with gastroduodenostomy.We retrospectively evaluated demographic variables (age, gender, height, weight, and smoking habits), the duration of general anesthesia (GA), and intraoperatively administered remifentanil consumption through the electronic medical records of patients who underwent LADG with gastroduodenostomy due to early stomach cancer. The primary outcome was postoperative opioid consumption during postoperative day (POD) 2. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of any rescue opioid analgesics administered, numeric rating scale, and various adverse effects during POD 2. We categorized the data in 2 patient groups to compare TIVA with propofol-remifentanil (TIVA group) to BA with desflurane-remifentanil (BA group) on the postoperative opioid analgesic consumption.We divided 114 patients into the TIVA (46 patients) and BA (68 patients) groups. Opioid consumption as a primary outcome was significantly higher in the BA group than in the TIVA group during POD 2 except in the post-anesthesia care unit. The cumulative opioid consumption was significantly higher in the BA than in the TIVA group. The incidence of rescue analgesic at POD 2 was higher in the BA than in the TIVA group. In the TIVA group, remifentanil consumption was higher, and the duration of GA was shorter than that in the BA group. No statistically significant differences were observed when comparing other variables.Our results indicated that the maintenance of GA with TIVA (propofol-remifentanil) reduces opioid consumption for postoperative pain control compared to BA (desflurane-remifentanil) in patients undergoing LADG with gastroduodenostomy. S-1, a new oral fluorouracil chemotherapeutical drug, has been increasingly used in clinical maintenance after first-line chemotherapy for stage III or IV gastric carcinoma (GC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) for its own advantages. XiangshaLiujunzi Decoction (XSLJZD), a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula with effects of alleviating the adverse reactions of chemotherapy and improving the quality of life of cancer patients has been gradually confirmed, with no more reports about the maintenance therapy mode of combination of chemotherapeutic drugs and TCM. We designed the study of XSLJZD combined with S-1 in the maintenance therapy of Stage III or IV GC and CRC, and hoped that this research program will go further and comprehensively evaluate its efficacy and safety.\\nThe aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of XSLJZD combined with S-1 in the maintenance therapy of stage III or IV GC and CRC.\\nThis study is an open, single-center, randomized study. Patients with stage III or stage IV GC and CRC will be randomized (1:1) into S-1group, S-1 combined with XSLJZD group for 5 years of maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, and secondary end point was overall survival and Quality of Life Assessment (QOLA), which include an improvement in symptoms before and after treatment, Karnofsky Performance Status, and adverse events assessment.\\nThis study will provide meaningful clinical information about the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs S-1 with TCM in the maintenance therapy of stage III or IV GC and CRC.\\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-INR-16008575. Studies of PDPN in cancers have focused on the interactions with palates through the binding with CECL-2 which mainly express on palates and immune cells, while little is known on its interactions with immune cells.PDPN expression in cancers was analyzed through Oncomine, GEPIA, and TIMER database. Prognostic value (HR, P value from log-rank test) was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier plotter and OncoLnc database. The correlations between PDPN and the infiltrating levels of immune cells in different cancers, and diverse immune markers in gastric cancer were investigated through TIMER database.High PDPN expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) and post-progression survival (PPS) particularly in gastric cancer (OS P\\u200a=\\u200a.0089; PPS P\\u200a=\\u200a.00085), especially among patients with Her-2 (+) and lymph node metastasis. In addition, PDPN was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of immune cells, other than B cells in gastric cancer. However, PDPN showed more correlations with immune markers of M2 type TAM (CD163, VSIG4, MS4A4A) and T cell exhaustion (TIM-3, TOX, and GZMB).These findings all suggest that high PDPN predicts poor survival outcomes, especially for Her-2 (+) gastric cancer patients. Though inducing M2 type TAM and T cell exhaustion, high PDPN can predict high levels of various immune cells infiltration in STAD. Those correlations may bring new ideas to immunology treatment for gastric cancer patients who do not benefit from the existing immune checkpoint inhibitors. Robotic surgery technology has significant advantages, but its limitations include lack of tactile feedback. Fluorescent-imaging technology, part of the da Vinci robotic surgery system, helps to overcome this lack of feedback and improve safety. This video demonstrates the utility of fluorescent-image guidance in robotic subtotal gastrectomy. First, peritumoral injection of indocyanine green helps localize the primary lesion. Second, it enables visualization of sentinel lymphatic flow to guide the extent of lymph node dissection. Third, intravenous injection of indocyanine green confirms adequate tissue perfusion of the remnant stomach. Lastly, fluorescent angiography also visualizes the jejunal arterial arcade in the mesentery. In summary, we consider that fluorescent-image guidance may provide important intraoperative information that supports techniques of robotic subtotal gastrectomy. Further studies to validate the benefits of fluorescent-image guidance are needed. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional contrast agents (CAs) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They have been extensively investigated as CAs due to their high biocompatibility and excellent magnetic properties. Furthermore, the ease of functionalization of their surfaces with different types of ligands (antibodies, peptides, sugars, etc.) opens up the possibility of carrying out molecular\\xa0MRI. Thus, IONPs functionalized with epithelial growth factor receptor antibodies, short peptides, like RGD, or aptamers, among others, have been proposed for the diagnosis of various types of cancer, including breast, stomach, colon, kidney, liver or brain cancer. In addition to cancer diagnosis, different types of IONPs have been developed for other applications, such as the detection of brain inflammation or the early diagnosis of thrombosis. This review addresses key aspects in the development of IONPs for MRI applications, namely, synthesis of the inorganic core, functionalization processes to make IONPs biocompatible and also to target them to specific tissues or cells, and finally in vivo studies in animal models, with special emphasis on tumor models. We report a case of transverse colon cancer resected by laparoscopic partial colectomy, followed by open gastrectomy. A man in his 70s was diagnosed with transverse colon cancer. He had a history of open gastrectomy for gastric lymphoma; thus, postoperative adhesions were expected in the upper abdomen. We performed a laparoscopic partial colectomy with gentle adhesiotomy, without injury. After preparation of the marginal vessels, blood flow towards the planned anastomotic line was confirmed by infrared observation after venous injection of indocyanine green. However, the initially planned oral anastomotic line did not show a blood supply; therefore, the anastomotic line was altered to a site of sufficient blood flow. In postlaparotomy cases, delicate handling and careful adhesiotomy are necessary in the laparoscopic approach due to the possibility of severe intraoperative injury resulting in conversion to open surgery. Furthermore, blood flow confirmation by fluorescence angiography is recommended in cases in which anatomical alterations might have occurred due to the previous operation. Gallbladder metastasis from gastric cancer is often found accidentally during postoperative pathological examinations, and its preoperative diagnosis is very difficult. There are a few reports in diagnostic imaging, and it is well known to have a very poor prognosis. There have been 13 reports on gallbladder metastasis from gastric cancer in the Japanese literature. Among the 13 reports, 10 cases were diagnosed with gallbladder metastasis synchronously and only 1 case was diagnosed as gallbladder metastasis before surgery. One case was reported as hematogenous metastasis, and 9 cases were reported as lymphoid metastasis. In total, 7 patients died, all within the first year after surgery. We experienced a case of synchronous gallbladder metastasis from gastric cancer. A Japanese man in his 60s presented with complaints of epigastric pain and weight loss. A gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple gastric ulcers and an irregular mound located on the wall of the lower gastric body along the greater curvature, which was suspected to be cancerous. A biopsy revealed that it was a Group 2 tumor even though the biopsy was repeated 4 times. He was referred to our hospital and 3 biopsies were performed. The final result classified the tumor as Group 4. The patient underwent surgery and the pathological examination revealed an extremely well-differentiated adenocarcinoma( EWDA). An EWDA is characterized by a well-formed mucinous gland with little or no nuclear atypia, which makes preoperative biopsy diagnosis difficult. A man in his 50s was admitted to our hospital due to hematemesis.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an 8 cm type 2 gastric tumor.The tumor was histologically diagnosed as a neuroendocrine carcinoma.CT showed that the tumor had directly infiltrated the liver but there was no distant metastasis.We performed open distal gastrectomy, D2 lymph node dissection, partial hepatectomy, and cholecystectomy.Four months after the surgery, metastases of the right adrenal gland and dorsal part of the inferior vena cava were found.Although a significant tumor reduction was obtained by 12 courses of chemotherapy with CDDP plus CPT-11, this effective treatment was discontinued for the patient\\'s convenience.Fifteen months after the surgery, metastasis of the right adrenal gland and dorsal part of inferior vena cava demonstrated re-growth without any further metastasis.After 4 courses of the same regimen, a partial response was obtained for the recurrences.As a salvage surgery, we performed open right adrenal gland and the lymph nodes of dorsal of IVC resection.The patient is alive without recurrence 1 year after the salvage surgery. The standard treatment for unresectable or recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST)is tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI). It is reported that resection of metastatic lesions after TKI administration prolongs progression free survival, but its influence on overall survival is not clarified. We experienced a case of GIST with peritoneal dissemination for which TKI administration and 2 local resections were effective. The patient was a man in his 70\\'s. We started chemotherapy with imatinib for GIST with peritoneal dissemination. However, it was discontinued due to the occurrence of interstitial pneumonia. Dissemination was evaluated as radically resectable on the images. After the interstitial pneumonia was alleviated, surgery was performed. Although sunitinib was introduced at 2 months postoperatively, recurrent peritoneal dissemination was detected at 32 months postoperatively, and treatment was then changed to regorafenib. Regorafenib treatment reduced the tumor size; however, Grade 3 albuminuria was detected 16 months after treatment initiation and, thus, this treatment was discontinued. Subsequently, the tumor enlarged again. Because there was only 1 recurrent lesion, we performed radical resection. Postoperatively, a reduced dose of regorafenib was re-administered. At present, 9 months after the re-surgery, the patient is alive without recurrence. A 73-year-old man was admitted with the chief complaint of upper abdominal discomfort.After close examination, he was diagnosed with a huge stomach gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST)that occupied the upper left abdomen with a maximum diameter of 150 mm.The patient was referred to our department for surgery.The border between the tumor and spleen was unclear on CT images.As the diaphragm was thinned due to compression by the tumor, gastrectomy with splenectomy and partial resection of the diaphragm was planned.For the diaphragmatic defects, a simple closure was considered at first. However, artifacts have a high risk of infection when the defect holes are too large.Therefore, in this case, we attempted to repair the diaphragm hole with the autologous fascia lata.Intraoperatively, while the tumor was resected with 1 more layer of the diaphragm, the diaphragm itself was thinned, resulting in a defect hole of about 60×80 mm.Therefore, an 80×110mm fascia lata was harvested, and the diaphragm was repaired.Fascia lata can be conveniently harvested as a free graft.In addition, the fascia of the thigh has the advantage of being more resistant to infection than artificial materials.In addition, there was no functional failure due to collection, and special plastic surgery techniques and tools were unnecessary.Thus, it is a useful reconstruction material for general surgeons.Here we report the details of the surgery along with a review of the literature. The patient was a 64-year-old man with Type 3 advanced cancer in the upper body of the stomach. The preoperative tumor marker value of CA19-9 was abnormally high, but there was no proof of distant metastasis or peritoneal dissemination. The first operation was an exploratory laparotomy due to direct tumor invasion to the pancreas. Systemic chemotherapy was performed for tumor reduction. First, S-1 plus cisplatin therapy was administered for 4 courses but discontinued because of renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia. In the second-line therapy, ramucirumabplus paclitaxel therapy was administered for 7 courses. Since the tumor invasion to the pancreas turned to be clear based on a CT scan, total gastrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy was performed. However, 5 months after surgery, a single nodule appeared in the upper abdomen that was suspected to be peritoneal dissemination. Nivolumab therapy was administered for 16 months without tumor enlargement or any adverse effect. Recently, there has been a marked development in chemotherapy for gastric cancer. Unresectable cases became operable after the administration of appropriate chemotherapy. In our case, nivolumab therapy had no adverse effect. However, serious adverse effects have been reported by several authors which suggests that regular examinations for interstitial pneumonia, hypothyroidism, and other adverse effects are important. We describe a case of residual stomach preserving surgery performed under evaluation of residual gastric blood flow with indocyanine green(ICG)fluorography, for gastric cancer with recurrence of splenic lymph node metastasis after distal gastrectomy( DG)in a 65-year-old man. After 4 courses of S-1 plus CDDP(SP)therapy for advanced gastric cancer with ascites, DG, D2 dissection, and Billroth Ⅰ reconstruction were performed and radical resection was obtained(L, Type 3, pap/tub, ypT3N1H0P0CY0M0, ypStage ⅡB). Three years and 6 months after the surgery, a mass 4 cm in diameter was found in the splenic hilum, and a pancreatosplenial resection was performed to remove the tumor for diagnosis and treatment purposes. We confirmed that there was no problem with blood flow, and we were able to preserve the stomach. Intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging was considered a promising method for evaluating residual gastric blood flow. We report a case of a 75-year-old man with a-fetoprotein(AFP)-producing gastric cancer accompanied by multiple large liver metastases. The patient underwent a total gastrectomy for gastric cancer(p-T3N3H0P0M0, fStage ⅢB). The patient then underwent chemotherapy(TS-1 80m g/day)following the radical operation. However, 5 months after the radical operation, he presented with multiple large liver tumors, which were subsequently biopsied. Based on immunohistochemical examination, the liver tumors were negative for AFP protein, but were similar to hepatoid adenocarcinoma, and no fibrosis was observed in the background liver. Therefore, we diagnosed the tumors as liver metastases of AFP producing gastric cancer and metachronous liver metastasis. The patient underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE). TACE decreased the AFP and PIVKA-Ⅱ levels and reduced the multiple huge liver metastases. Due to the increase in AFP and the multiple liver metastases, despite intensive hepatic infusion chemotherapy, he died 5 months after admission. We report the case of an 80-year-old man with unresectable, advanced gastric cancer and pulmonary cancer because of multiple liver metastases. The serum hemoglobin level declined to 5.3 g/dL during fourth-line chemotherapy. Radiation therapy of 30 Gy was administered in 10 fractions. After radiation treatment was completed, the serum hemoglobin level increased to 8.5g/dL. No new adverse event was observed. Subsequently, the progression of anemia stopped, and oral intake became possible. Thus, palliative radiation therapy is useful for hemorrhage control in unresectable, advanced gastric cancer patients with a poor general condition and difficult surgical treatment. The recent phase Ⅲ trials REGARD and RAINBOW have shown survival benefits and acceptable safetyprofiles of ramucirumab( RAM)alone and RAM plus paclitaxel. Based on this result, RAM is recommended as a secondarytreatment for advanced and recurrent gastric cancer bythe Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. Although the frequencyis not high, gastrointestinal perforation has been reported as a serious side effect. RAM is a human anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(VEGFR-2)monoclonal antibodythat acts on vascular endothelial cells to inhibit angiogenesis. The detailed mechanism has not been elucidated, but it is thought that the ischemic state and delayed wound healing due to the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factors could be the cause of perforation. Thus, the usage of angiogenesis inhibitors such as RAM while intestinal stents are placed, mayincrease the risk of gastrointestinal perforation. We report a case in which RAM was administrated with no adverse events after multiple gastrointestinal metal stents being inserted. We report the clinical course of 6 gastric cancer patients who received radiation therapy at our hospital for solitary lymph node metastasis. The site of the metastatic lymph node was the clavicle, para-aorta, para-portal vein, common hepatic artery, and diaphragm in 1, 1, 2, 1, and 1 case, respectively. Median irradiation dose was 50[range, 45-50.4]Gy, and combination chemotherapy was administered in 4 cases. The clinical outcome was complete response and partial response in 3 cases each, with no adverse events associated with radiation therapy. The median progression-free survival was 11.3 months. In summary, local treatment by radiation therapy is one of the treatment options for patients with solitary lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer. Case 1: A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with type 3 gastric cancer cStage Ⅲ(MU, Gre, tub2>por, cT4aN2M0)induced by gastric perforation. The first surgery involving resection of the lesser curvature of stomach lymph node was judged to be difficult, and eventually exploratory laparotomy was performed. He received 3 courses of chemotherapy using S-1 plus oxaliplatin(SOX)(S-1 120mg/m2/day, day 1-14, oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2, day 1, followed by 7 days of rest). He subsequently underwent curative laparotomy gastrectomy plus D2(-No. 10)lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Histological type was judged to be Grade 3. Case 2: A 69-year-old man was diagnosed with type 2 esophageal gastric junctional cancer,(GE, Less, tub2, cT4aN3M1[LYM])of cStage Ⅳ. He received 6 courses of chemotherapy using trastuzu- mab plus S-1 plus oxaliplatin(HER plus SOX)(trastuzumab 8mg/kg[2nd course 6mg/kg], day 1, S-1 120mg/m2/day, day 1-14, oxaliplatin 100mg/m2[5th course 80 mg/m2], on day 1, followed by 7 days of rest). He subsequently underwent laparotomy of the lower esophageal total gastrectomy plus D2(-No. 10, +No. 16, No. 110)lymph node dissection, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction as conversion surgery. Histological type was Grade 3. Both were impressive cases suggesting the usefulness of SOX therapy as a multidisciplinary treatment strategy for advanced gastric cancer. A 78-year-old man diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer and para-aortic lymph node metastases at clinical stage cT3 (SS)N1M1(LYN), Stage Ⅳwas treated with S-1/docetaxel(S-1/DTX)therapy. Eight months later, lymph node metastases resolved on abdominal CT, and the primary lesion appeared scarred when viewed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; this was considered to be a complete response(CR). S-1/DTX therapy was administered for a total of 16 courses, followed by 13 courses ofS -1 therapy. During the treatment, CR was maintained. Though chemotherapy was completed 2 years and 2 months after its initiation, the patient\\'s serum CEA level was found to be elevated. As the serum CEA level gradually increased, S-1/DTX therapy was resumed. Three months after chemotherapy was restarted, PET-CT revealed multiple bone metastases. The chemotherapy protocol was changed to paclitaxel/ramucirumab therapy followed by nivolumab therapy. Disease control was difficult, and the patient died 9 months after reinstituting chemotherapy(3 years and 8 months after the first chemo- therapy). This case report summarizes our treatment ofa patient with advanced gastric cancer using S-1/DTX therapy for an extended period of time. An 82-year-old man with Stage Ⅳ advanced gastric cancer and multiple liver metastases was referred to our hospital. Chemotherapy using S-1 was administered, resulting in withdrawal from the usual course because of an adverse event of grade 4 anorexia. GIS and EOB-MRI showed a prominent tumor reduction in both lesions; however, despite this, distal gastrectomy, D2 lymph node dissection, liver biopsy for S3 lesion, partial liver resection for S6 lesion, and cholecystectomy were performed to obtain a therapeutic diagnosis. Pathology revealed that the tumor cells remained in the main liver metastatic lesions. Therapeutic effect was assessed as Grade 2. Although weekly paclitaxel followed by reduced S-1 dosage was introduced after surgery, the recurrent mass was observed in the para-aortic region after 2 years. Subsequently, para-aortic lymph node dissection was performed because no new lesion was detected. More than 10 years have passed without any recurrence since the first surgery. As part of a multidisciplinary treatment for far advanced gastric cancer with multiple liver metastases (Stage Ⅳ), conversion surgery might be considered effective. The splenic artery and vein are important to the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy(DG). Hence, total gastrectomy is recommended when performing gastrectomy and distal pancreatectomy(DP)with splenectomy(S). In the present case, a man in his 70s was diagnosed with early gastric cancer. Abdominal CT detected a dilated main pancreatic duct. Chronic pancreatitis was suspected, but malignancy could not be completely ruled out. Thus, DG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction and DP with S were performed simultaneously. The remnant gastric blood flow was evaluated with intraoperative indocyanine green(ICG)fluorography and the blood flow was confirmed. Finally, the remnant stomach was preserved. The postoperative course was uneventful, except for the occurrence of anastomosis edema. This result suggests that ICG fluorescence is useful to evaluate remnant gastric blood flow and that it may be possible to perform DG and DP with S simultaneously depending on the case. We report a case of vascular anomaly of Adachi type Ⅵ. The common hepatic artery does not appear at the superior edge of the pancreas in Adachi type Ⅵ. A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with gastric cancer. Preoperative computed tomography showed the vascular anomaly. The patient was treated successfully with robot-assisted distal gastrectomy by the da Vinci Surgical System®(da Vinci). The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 10 days after surgery. The vascular anomaly makes the dissection of lymph nodes No. 8a and 9, difficult. Owing to wristed instruments with several joints and 3D-HD visualization, the da Vinci is superior to conventional laparoscopic surgery in completing detailed and complex procedures. Therefore, the da Vinci is useful for performing an extremely challenging gastrectomy procedure, as in this case. A 62-year-old woman was diagnosed with gastric cancer, Type 4, cT4b(LN, mesentery of transverse colon), N1 M1H0P1CY1, cStage ⅣB. S-1 and L-OHP(SOX)were administered for 4 courses and clinical response was SD. She interrupted the treatment because of practicing folk therapy. She had an emergency hospitalization due to pyloric stenosis, vomiting, and an umbilical tumor with pain. She was treated with 1 course of mFOLFOX6(5-FU, L-OHP, l-LV)followed by palliative surgery(laparoscopy assisted distal gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y reconstruction, resection of umbilical tumor, and bypass for transverse colon stenosis due to dissemination). The pathological diagnosis was L, Circ, Type 4, 126×89 mm, por> sig, pT4b(SI, mesentery of transverse colon), pN3a(12/13), H0P1CY1, pStageⅣ, and metastatic umbilical tumor. Following surgery, oral administration of mFOLFOX6 is continued. Umbilical metastasis(Sister Mary Joseph\\'s nodule)is associated with poor prognosis, however, appropriate management including symptom control by palliative surgery and continuation of chemotherapy may lead a better prognosis. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus ramucirumab(nab-PTX plus RAM)for the treatment of unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer. Sixteen patients received nab-PTX plus RAM. The overall response rate was 37.5%, and disease control rate was 87.5%. The median progression-free survival was 5.0 months. Grade 3 or higher adverse events(neutropenia: 62.5%, leukopenia: 18.8%, decrease appetite: 6.3%, hypertension: 6.3%, and proteinuria: 12.5%)were observed. Although dose reduction of nab-PTX was required in 93.8% of the patients, no adverse event that led to the discontinuation of treatment. Nab-PTX plus RAM combination therapy showed promising efficacy and manageable toxicities and could be a viable treatment option for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Low serum carnitine levels have been reported in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and are considered one of the factors causing fatigue associated with chemotherapy. We evaluated the effectiveness of L-carnitine in the treatment of fatigue associated with chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer(GC).\\nWe performed a randomized controlled trial between December 2013 and December 2018. Untreated patients with advanced GC were included in the study; 1 patient developed an allergy after receiving the first chemotherapy and was excluded from the study. The primary endpoint was brief fatigue inventory(BFI). Patients were categorized into 2 groups: those who received L-carnitine oral supplements(group C)and those who did not receive L-carnitine oral supplements(group N).\\nThe serum carnitine levels were improved significantly in group C compared with group N. BFIwas more aggravated in group N than group C; however, the difference was not significant.\\nWe could not demonstrate the effectiveness of L-carnitine in the treatment of fatigue associated with chemotherapy in patients with GC. Gastric cancer with extensive lymph node metastasis(ELM)is commonly considered unresectable and has a poor prognosis. We conducted a phase Ⅱ study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of capecitabine and cisplatin(XP)as preoperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer with ELM.\\nThe patients received 2 21-day cycles of XP therapy(ca- pecitabine at 2,000mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks and cisplatin at 80 mg/m2 on day 1)followed by gastrectomy with D2 plus para-aortic nodal dissection. After R0 resection, S-1 chemotherapy was administered for 1 year. The primary end point was response rate(RR). The planned sample size was 30.\\nBetween April 2015 and November 2016, 4 patients were enrolled, but the enrollment was terminated because of poor patient recruitment. The clinical RR was 50%, and R0 resection was achieved in 75% of the patients. The common Grade 3 adverse events during XP therapy were leukocytopenia(25%), anemia(25%), and hyperlipidemia(25%). The common Grade 3 surgical morbidity was abdominal abscess(33%)and pancreatic fistula(33%). The pathological RR was 25%.\\nPreoperative XP therapy was feasible, but its efficacy was difficult to evaluate because of the small sample size. A 68-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy for Stage Ⅳ advanced gastric cancer with para-aortic lymph node metastasis on September 21, 2006. Adjuvant chemotherapy with 100mg/body/day S-1, with 4 weeks ofadministration and 2 weeks ofrest, was started on October 18, 2006, and stopped after completing 25 courses, on October 13, 2009. The patient remains disease-free 12 years after the operation. Herein, we report a case of unresectable lung cancer in which S-1 monotherapy contributed to an improvement in the patient\\'s quality of life and to prolonged survival. A 44-year-old man with primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma(negative driver mutation and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 1-24%)of clinical stage ⅢA(cT4N0M0)underwent multidisciplinary treatment as follows: 1 ) weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel plus radiotherapy as induction chemoradiotherapy, 2 ) surgery that revealed that the lesion was unresectable, 3 ) cisplatin plus pemetrexed as second-line treatment, and 4 ) pembrolizumab as third-line treatment. However, the disease progressed after 19 courses of pembrolizumab, and the patient developed cachexia due to esophageal stenosis caused by tumor enlargement. He underwent percutaneous gastrostomy and was fed via a gastrostomy tube. S-1 monotherapy(2-week administration every 3 weeks)was introduced as fourth-line treatment. After 3 courses of S-1 monotherapy, the patient complained of regurgitation of stomach fluid. Computed tomography( CT)revealed that the primary tumor had decreased in size, and he developed the ability to drink water. After 6 courses of S-1, CT revealed progressive disease, so atezolizumab was administered as fifth-line treatment. However, after 2 courses, mediastinitis due to esophageal penetration into the mediastinum occurred. The patient died 28 months after the initial treatment. We examined the occurrence of complications following gastric cancer surgery in the elderly and its influence on the prognosis of reduction surgery.The study included 805 surgical cases of gastric cancer; elderly, middle-aged, and young patients were examined.In the elderly patients, there was a tendency to undergo reduction surgery.According to the gastric cancer treatment guidelines, 28.9% of the elderly patients, 5.3% of the middle-aged patients, and 0% of the young patients did not satisfy the criteria for lymph node dissection. The incidences of postoperative complications were 25.6%, 23.0%, and 13.4%in the elderly, middle-aged, and young patients, respectively, with a higher tendency seen in elderly patients.In elderly patients, the survival rate was examined separately for each postoperative complication, but no significant difference was noted.Additionally, the survival rate was assessed for the limited surgery and standard surgery groups; however, no significant difference was noted.Therefore, it is recommended that the optimal lymph node dissection range be determined in the elderly with respect to the general condition. A man in his 60s with a large Type 3 gastric cancer presented with the chief complaint of epicardial discomfort. We decided to perform laparoscopy. The patient was diagnosed with cT4aN2M1(CY1), cStage Ⅳ disease and was treated with XP(capecitabine plus cisplatin[CDDP])plus trastuzumab(HER). After chemotherapy, CY0 was confirmed using laparoscopy. The patient underwent total gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection. Histopathological examination revealed ypT4aN3M0, ypStage ⅢC disease. Therefore, adjuvant treatment with XP plus HER was continued. Four months after surgery, liver, lung, and # 16b1latLN metastases were observed on CT. The metastatic foci were observed even after 3 courses of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel. Nivolumab was administered as the third-line treatment; after 3 courses, the liver metastasis increased markedly. Hence, our final diagnosis was hyperprogressive disease(HPD). Here, we report a case of superficial-type gastric cancer with metastatic ovarian cancer(Krukenberg tumor)diagnosed by exploratory laparotomy. Chemotherapy was initiated at an early stage in this patient. A 43-year-old woman with superficialtype gastric cancer(0-Ⅱb plusⅡa), an ovarian tumor, and a solitary sclerotic bone lesion underwent exploratory laparotomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathological findings showed that the resected ovarian tumor specimen contained the same type of signet ring cell carcinoma as the biopsy gastric cancer specimen; hence, the patient was diagnosed with superficial- type gastric cancer with metastatic ovarian cancer. She was treated with first-line chemotherapy(capecitabine plus oxaliplatin)15 days after exploratory laparotomy, followed by second-line chemotherapy(ramucirumab plus paclitaxel), thirdline chemotherapy(nivolumab), and fourth-line chemotherapy(irinotecan). Twenty-two months after the start of first-line chemotherapy, she finally died due to bone metastasis. Multiple sporadic gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST)are rare, except for those restricted to von Recklinghausen disease or hereditary conditions.We reported a case of a gastric GIST resected 9 years after the resection of a duodenal GIST.The patient was a 58-year-old male who had been followed-up with computed tomography scans after pancreatoduodenectomy for a duodenal GIST when he was 49-years-old.The patient was admitted to our hospital for anemia examination.A CT scan detected a tumor in the stomach, with a diameter of over 10 cm, and necrosis.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed the presence of a delle on the gastric SMT.Due to suspected invasion of the spleen and left diaphragm by the tumor, we performed subtotal gastrectomy with splenectomy and left diaphragm segmental resection.In the pathological diagnosis, the tumor was diagnosed as a gastric GIST, because the cell type of the tumor was spindle and tested positive for c-kit.Based on the tumor size and mitotic count, the patient was diagnosed with high-risk GIST by the modified-Fletcher classification, and imatinib 400mg/day was administered.There have been no signs of recurrence for 2 years since the operation. A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and obstructive jaundice. A covered self-expandable metallic stent(SEMS)was placed endoscopically. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus nabpaclitaxel was provided. Forty-seven days after the SEMS placement, she presented with hematemesis. Computed tomography revealed migration of SEMS into the small bowel. No pseudoaneurysms were detected. Upper digestive endoscopy demonstrated hemobilia without obvious causes of bleeding in the stomach or duodenum. As hemorrhage recurrence was confirmed in the bile duct, we performed pancreaticoduodenectomy. Thus, bile duct hemorrhage can occur in patients with pancreatic cancer after SEMS placement. An 85-year-old man was diagnosed with esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma, E=G, Type 2, por, 6 cm in size, cT4aN1M0, cStage ⅢA. He had a history of atherosclerosis obliterans and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Considering the comorbidities and life expectancy, we decided to perform chemotherapy without tumor resection. Although the renal function was poor, we chose SP therapy(S-1 80mg/kg/day for 14 days, followed by 7-day rest, CDDP 30mg/kg/day on day 1)because the current status of the patient was satisfactory. The primary tumor remarkably shrank after 2 courses of SP therapy and completely disappeared after 5 courses of SP therapy. There were no adverse events during the entire course of treatment. We detected clinical CR and provided the S-1 monotherapy for another 2 years. The patient has survived with no recurrences for 7 years since the initial chemotherapy. Although intensive chemotherapy regimens are avoided in elderly patients, the patient, in this case, showed a favorable prognosis from powerful chemotherapy. FOLFOX therapy has been used for gastric cancer in Japan since 2017. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of FOLFOX therapy compared to that of FP. Forty-seven cases were evaluated between January 2010 and December 2018. Eighteen patients received mFOLFOX6 therapy, and 29 patients received FP therapy. The median time to treatment failure was 206 days in the mFOLFOX6 group and 58 days in the FP group. The response rate was 50% in the mFOLFOX6 group and 17% in the FP group. Neutropenia(56%), thrombocytopenia(50%), and peripheral neuropathy(56%)were the common adverse events in the mFOLFOX6 group, and leukopenia(69%)and neutropenia(69%)were the common adverse effects in the FP group. Based on our results, we conclude that, unlike FP, FOLFOX is an effective therapy for of gastric cancer. To identify a safe carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) regimen for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).\\nWe generated treatment plans for 13 consecutive, unselected patients who were treated for LAPC with CIRT at our center using three dose and fractionation schedules: 4.6 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200912, 4.0 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200914, and 3.0 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200917. We tested the ability to meet published dose constraints for the duodenum, stomach, and small bowel as a function of dose schedule and distance between the tumor and organs at risk.\\nUsing 4.6 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200912 and 4.0 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200914, critical (high-dose) constraints could only reliably be achieved when target volumes were not immediately adjacent to organs at risk. Critical constraints could be met in all cases using 3.0 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200917. Low-dose constraints could not uniformly be achieved using any dose schedule.\\nWhile selected patients with LAPC may be treated safely with a CIRT regimen of 4.6 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200912, our dosimetric analyses indicate that a more conservative schedule of 3.0 GyRBE\\u2009×\\u200917 may be required to safely treat a broader population of LAPC patients, including those with large tumors and tumors that approach gastrointestinal organs at risk. The result of this work was used to guide an ongoing clinical trial. Cancer cells are often found postoperatively at surgical resection margins (RM) in patients with gastric cancer because of submucosal infiltration or hesitation to secure adequate RM. This study was designed to evaluate risk factors for microscopic positive RM and to clarify which patients should undergo intraoperative frozen section diagnosis (IFSD).\\nPatients who underwent R0/1 gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma between 2000 and 2018 in a single cancer center in Japan were studied. We divided the patients into a positive RM group and negative RM group according to the results of definitive histopathological examinations. We performed multivariate analysis to analyze risk factors for positive RM by and used the identified risk factors to risk stratify the patients.\\nA total of 2757 patients were studied, including 49 (1.8%) in the positive RM group. The risk factors significantly associated with positive RM were remnant gastric cancer (odds ratio [OR] 4.7), esophageal invasion (OR 6.3), tumor size ≥80\\u2009mm (OR 3.9), and a histopathological diagnosis of undifferentiated type (OR 3.6), macroscopic type 4 (OR 3.7), or pT4 disease (OR 4.6). On risk stratification analysis, the incidence of positive RM was 0.1% without any risk factors, increasing to 0.4% with one risk factor, 3.1% with two risk factors, 5.3% with three risk factors, 21.3% with four risk factors, and 85.7% with five risk factors.\\nThe risk of macroscopically positive RM increased in patients who have risk factors. IFSD should be performed in patients who have four or more risk factors. \\u2002Pyloric gland adenomas (PGAs) are very rare and underdiagnosed, mostly be founded in the stomach. Similar to colorectal adenomas they have a high risk of malignant transformation to adenocarcinoma up to 12-47\\u200a%. Endoscopic resections in the duodenum harbor a significant risk of complications. EMR is the current standard technique for treatment of duodenal non-ampullary adenomas. Complete resection rates are considerably high at about 90\\u200a%. Adverse events as bleeding was reported up to 25\\u200a%. ESD is not recommended for resection of duodenal lesions since the perforation rate may be as high as 35\\u200a%. Use of EFTR in the duodenum are limited to a single case study of 20 patients.\\n\\u2002A 67 year old patient with attenuated polyposis coli presented for screening. Gastroscopy showed a 20\\u200amm large, non-ampullary lesions in the proximal duodenum (pars I). The margins of the duodenal lesions were marked with a high-frequency (HF) probe. An integrated balloon dilatation (20\\u200amm) of the upper esophageal sphincter and the pylorus was performed to facilitate advancing of the gastroduodenal FTRD\\n\\u2002Herein we present the first case of duodenal EFTR in a patient with attenuated FAP and a PGA. There are currently no specific guidelines for the removal and surveillance. ASGE recommends resection and surveillance endoscopy at 3-5 years interval.\\n\\u2002Das Pylorusdrüsenadenom (PGA) ist eine unterdiagnostizierte, seltene Entität, die meist im Magen zu finden ist. Ähnlich wie kolorektale Adenome haben PGAs ein hohes Risiko für eine maligne Entartung zum Adenokarzinom von bis zu 12–47\\u200a%. Endoskopische Resektionen im Duodenum bergen ein erhebliches Risiko für Komplikationen. Die endoskopische Mukosaresektion (EMR) ist die derzeitige Standardtechnik zur Behandlung von duodenalen nichtampullären Adenomen. Die vollständigen Resektionsraten sind mit etwa 90\\u200a% beträchtlich hoch. Komplikationen wie Blutungen wurden bis zu 25\\u200a% verzeichnet. Die endoskopische Submukosadissektion (ESD) wird für die Resektion von Duodenalläsionen nicht empfohlen, da die Perforationsrate bis zu 35\\u200a% betragen kann. Die Anwendung der endoskopischen Vollwandresektion (EFTR) im Duodenum ist auf eine Fallstudie mit 20 Patienten beschränkt. FALL: \\u2002Ein 67-jähriger Patient mit attenuierter Polyposis coli (FAP) wurde zum Screening vorgestellt. Die Gastroskopie zeigte eine 20\\u200amm große, nichtampulläre Läsion im proximalen Duodenum (Pars I). Die Ränder der Duodenalläsionen wurden mit einer Hochfrequenzsonde (HF) markiert. Eine integrierte Ballondilatation (20\\u200amm) des oberen Ösophagussphinkters und des Pylorus erleichterte das Vorschieben des Device (FTRD\\n\\u2002Hier präsentieren wir den ersten Fall einer duodenalen EFTR bei einem Patienten mit attenuierter FAP mit Erstbeschreibung eines Pylorusdrüsenadenoms. Derzeit gibt es keine spezifischen Richtlinien für die Entfernung und Überwachung. Die ASGE empfiehlt bei Pylorusdrüsenadenomen eine Resektions- und Überwachungsendoskopie im Abstand von 3–5 Jahren. Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapies have shown promising clinical activity against gastric cancer (GC). We evaluated the clinical significance of immune-related gene expression in GC tissues to better understand the tumor immune microenvironment.\\nPD-1, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CD8 mRNA levels and clinicopathological factors, including survival, were examined by quantitative RT-PCR in 155 GC patients who underwent surgery. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue from 24 GC patients was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis.\\nPD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 mRNA levels were significantly lower in tumor tissue than in normal tissue (p < 0.0001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.0001). GC patients with low PD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 mRNA levels had significantly poorer overall survival (OS) than those with high PD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 mRNA levels, respectively (p < 0.001, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Low PD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 mRNA levels were more significantly associated with poor prognosis in undifferentiated-type GC patients than in differentiated-type GC patients (PD-1: differentiated p = 0.0071 vs. undifferentiated p = 0.0024; PD-L1: p = 0.6527 vs. p < 0.0001; CD8: p = 0.4465 vs. p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis, peritoneal dissemination, distant metastasis, low PD-1 mRNA levels and low CD8 mRNA levels were independent prognostic factors for worse OS (low PD-1 mRNA level: OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.10-4.58, p < 0.05; low CD8 mRNA level: OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.12-6.90, p < 0.05). PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA levels in immune cells were significantly associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 protein levels (both p < 0.05), respectively.\\nPD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 mRNA levels may reflect antitumor immunity in GC, and low PD-1 and CD8 mRNA levels are potential predictive biomarkers for poor prognosis in GC patients who underwent surgery. Second-line chemotherapy (SLC) improves survival in advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Patients receiving SLC are categorized into two disease status groups: tumour progression after first-line chemotherapy and early recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy. Differences between these groups have not yet been clarified.\\nA total of 163 eligible patients registered in the randomized phase III TRICS trial evaluating SLC for patients with AGC was classified into the progressive disease (PD) group (n\\xa0=\\xa055) or the early relapse (ER) group (n\\xa0=\\xa0108). We compared overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety. Adjusted OS and adjusted PFS were estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).\\nThe ER group had a lower median age than the PD group (66 vs. 72 years; P\\xa0=\\xa00.016), performance status (PS) 0 was more frequently seen in the ER group (87% vs. 71%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.012). The adjusted median OS was 13.7 months in the ER group and 13.6 months in the PD group (IPTW hazard ratio [HR]: 1.023; P\\xa0=\\xa00.854). The adjusted median PFS was 4.9 months in the ER group and 4.4 months in the PD group (IPTW HR: 0.707; P\\xa0=\\xa00.004). ORR was significantly better in the ER group than the PD group (21.3% vs. 4.9%; P\\xa0=\\xa00.020). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of adverse events.\\nER was associated with improved PFS and better ORR than PD, although no difference in survival was demonstrated. From the viewpoint of treatment outcome, it seems appropriate to treat patients with ER in the same way as patients with PD.\\nUMIN 000002571. To uncover the role of microRNA-339-5p (miRNA-339-5p) in the development of gastric cancer (GC) and its possible molecular mechanism.\\nDifferential expressions of miRNA-339-5p in GC and adjacent normal tissues were detected. The relationship between miRNA-339-5p level and clinical features in GC patients was analyzed. Proliferative and migratory changes in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells overexpressing miRNA-339-5p were examined. Finally, luciferase assay and rescue experiments were conducted to explore the regulatory mechanism of miRNA-339-5p in its downstream gene ALKBH1, and their interaction in the development of GC.\\nMiRNA-339-5p was downregulated in GC tissues. Lowly expressed miRNA-339-5p was unfavorable to prognosis in GC because of high rates of lymphatic metastasis and distant metastasis. Overexpression of miRNA-339-5p markedly reduced proliferative and migratory abilities in GC cells. ALKBH1 was identified to be the downstream gene of miRNA-339-5p. In GC tissues, ALKBH1 was upregulated and negatively correlated to miRNA-339-5p level. Overexpression of ALKBH1 was able to reverse the inhibitory effects of overexpressed miRNA-339-5p on proliferative and migratory abilities in GC.\\nLowly expressed miRNA-339-5p is closely related to metastasis and poor prognosis in GC patients. MiRNA-339-5p suppresses the malignant development of GC by negatively regulating ALKBH1. Gastric cancer is an extracolonic manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and is associated with high-risk gastric polyps. There are no known endoscopic criteria to identify these high-risk polyps. Our aim was to develop endoscopic criteria to identify high-risk polyps on endoscopy in FAP.\\nWe prospectively collected 150 gastric polyps in consecutive patients undergoing surveillance EGD at the Cleveland Clinic. Pictures were taken of each polyp under narrow-band imaging and high-definition white light. In an exploratory phase, 5 endoscopists developed consensus criteria using the images to distinguish high-risk (pyloric gland adenoma, tubular adenoma, hyperplastic) from low-risk (fundic gland with low-grade or no dysplasia) polyps. In the assessment phase, endoscopists were blinded to polyp pathology and used the criteria to predict the individual polyp risk category. To measure diagnostic accuracy, we reported the mean sensitivity, specificity, and interrater agreement (κ).\\nConsensus criteria were developed based on 16 low-risk and 9 high-risk polyps. The final 149 polyps consisted of 128 low-risk and 22 high-risk polyps (1 polyp was excluded from analysis). Using the criteria, the 5 endoscopists distinguished high- from low-risk polyps with a mean sensitivity and specificity of 79% (16.3%) and 78.8% (10.8%), respectively. The κ coefficient was .45, indicating moderate agreement.\\nWe developed endoscopic criteria to distinguish between high- and low-risk polyps associated with gastric cancer in FAP. The criteria provide guidance to endoscopists in targeting high-risk polyps while surveying the stomach of patients with proximal gastric polyposis. That clinical trial (RAINBOW) showed that a 7.4 months overall survival benefit with the combination therapy with ramucirumab (RAM) and paclitaxel (PAC) as second-line therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, compared with placebo (PLA) plus paclitaxel. We performed an analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of RAM from a Chinese perspective and recognized the range of drug costs.\\nBy building a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs) and lifetime costs. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities were estimated for the published literature, Chinese health care system and local price setting. We performed threshold analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the uncertainty of the model.\\nCompared with PLA strategy, RAM strategy provided an incremental survival benefit of 1.22 LYs and 0.64 QALYs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that when RAM costs less than $151 or $753 per 4 weeks, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) approximated the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP), suggesting that there was 50% likelihood that the ICER for RAM + PAC would be less than $44528.4 per QALY or $48121 per QALY, respectively.\\nFor patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who fail first-line chemotherapy, our results are conducive to the multilateral drug price guidance negotiations of RAM in China. Hereditary ventricular polyposis in the form of gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS) is a rare condition characterised by a typical distribution of polyps in the stomach and risk of gastric cancer at a young age. Prophylactic gastrectomy may be indicated. The condition is not thought to be associated with increased risk of colon cancer, but the evidence base is limited. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of death from cancer in Japan, after lung, colorectal, and stomach cancers and has the lowest survival among these tumors, because of not only no symptoms, no screening tool and no biomarkers but also high rates of recurrence and metastasis. In addition, pancreatic cancer has excessive stroma which serves as a severe biological barrier for anticancer drug delivery and successful treatment. Therefore, there are many challenges for drug delivery systems for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Recently, we developed self-assembly PEGylation retaining activity (SPRA) technology, which comprises a reversible pegylated protein complex without loss of bioactivity. SPRA technology is based on a host-guest interaction between PEGylated β-cyclodextrin and adamantane-appended protein. In this review, first pancreatic cancer is introduced, second, principle drug delivery systems for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are described, and third the concept of SPRA technology as well as examples of SPRA proteins, especially focusing on the potential of SPRA-bromelain for treatment of pancreatic cancer, are introduced. To investigate the possible role of miR-449a/b in the occurrence of gastric cancer.\\nThe expression of miR-449a/b and E2F1 mRNA in gastric cancer cells BGC-823 and gastric mucosal cells GES-1 were detected with qRT-PCR. miR-449a/b mimics or a negative control was transiently transfected into BGC-823 cells, and the changes in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration ability were assessed using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and scratch wound healing assay, respectively. Western blotting was used to observe the effects of miR-449a/b upregulation on its target gene expression. The effects of transfection with an E2F1-over-expressing plasmid or an empty plasmid were analyzed on the expression level of miR-449a/b in BGC-823 cells using qRT-PCR and digital PCR.\\nThe gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 showed significantly a lowered expression of miR-449a/b compared with the normal gastric mucosal cell line GES-1 (\\nThe low expression of miR-449a/b and the high expression of E2F1 are both involved in the occurrence and progression of gastric cancer, and miR-449a/b negatively regulates E2F1 to inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism of recombinant methioninase (rMETase) in promoting apoptosis of gastric cancer cells.\\nGastric cancer SGC-7901 cells were treated with rMETase (final concentration of 1.25 and 2.50 mmmol/L) for 72 h, and the changes in the cell viability were detected using CCK-8 method and the cell morphology changes were observed under an inverted microscope. Plate colony formation assay was used to evaluate colony formation ability of the cells, and flow cytometry was performed to analyze the changes in cell apoptosis and cell cycles. Glucose and lactate levels in the culture medium were determined using a colorimetric method and ATP concentration was detected using a fluorescence microplate reader; Western blotting was used to assess the effect of rMETase on PI3K/Akt pathway, glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), glycolysis- related proteins and apoptotic proteins in SGC-7901 cells.\\nrMETase significantly inhibited the proliferation and clonal formation, promoted cell apoptosis, and induced cell cycle arrest in S phase in SGC-7901 cells (\\nrMETase can inhibit aerobic glycolysis, induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells by inhibiting the activity of PI3K/Akt/GLUT-1 pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for gastric cancer. Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignant tumor having poor prognosis globally. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a circular endogenous RNA generated by special selective splicing that occurs in various traits. Studies show that hsa_circ_0017639 is abnormally expressed and involved in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the hsa_circ_0017639 role in GC is unknown. This study detected hsa_circ_0017639 expression in a GC cell line using RT-qPCR. Subcellular localization of hsa_circ_0017639 was verified via FISH. We assessed correlations amongst miRNA, hsa_circ_0017639 and relative protein levels using luciferase reporter assays and RNA pulldown assays. The data illustrated that in hsa_circ_assays, expression was enhanced in GC cell. Downregulation of hsa_circ_0017639 decreased GC cell proliferation and migration in in vitro and in vivo experiments. RNA pulldown and RT-qPCR analysis verified that hsa_circ_0017639 sponged miR-224-5p. Bioinformatic and luciferase reporter assays validated that miR-224-5p and USP3 were downstream targets of hsa_circ_0017639. Upregulation of USP3 or downregulation of miR-224-5p restored proliferation and migration by MKN-28 and MGC-803 cells after hsa_circ_0017639 silencing. Upregulation of USP3 restored MKN-28 and MGC-803 cell proliferation and migration after overexpression of miR-224-5p. Our collective findings advised that hsa_circ_0017639 takes part in GC progression through regulating the miR-224-5p/USP3 axis, highlighting its potential as an effective GC therapeutic target. The association between chronic inflammation and gastric carcinogenesis is well established, but it is not clear how immune cells and cytokines regulate this process. We investigated the role of interleukin 27 (IL27) in the development of gastric atrophy, hyperplasia, and metaplasia (preneoplastic lesions associated with inflammation-induced gastric cancer) in mice with autoimmune gastritis.\\nWe performed studies with TxA23 mice (control mice), which express a T-cell receptor against the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase α chain and develop autoimmune gastritis, and TxA23xEbi3\\nWe identified IL27-secreting macrophages and dendritic cell in the corpus of mice with chronic gastritis (TxA23 mice). Mice deficient in IL27 developed more severe gastritis, atrophy, and SPEM than control mice. Administration of recombinant IL27 significantly reduced the severity of inflammation, atrophy, and SPEM in mice with gastritis. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that IL27 acted almost exclusively on stomach-infiltrating CD4+ T cells to suppress expression of inflammatory genes.\\nIn studies of mice with autoimmune gastritis, we found that IL27 is an inhibitor of gastritis and SPEM, suppressing CD4+ T-cell-mediated inflammation in the gastric mucosa.  Workers who are exposed to dust in the workplace tend to show a higher incidence of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, scientific evidence to support an association between dust exposure and the risk of gastric cancer is inadequate. This study aimed to investigate whether or not occupational dust exposure influences the risk of gastric cancer.\\nWe collected the electronic data from the Pneumoconiosis Health Examination (PHE) program, provided by the Ministry of Employment and Labor and the Korea Workers\\' Compensation and Welfare Service from 2002 to 2017. The PHE database was linked to the National Health Insurances databases. The age-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the risk of gastric cancers were evaluated in workers with occupational dust exposure, and the results were compared to those in the general population.\\nFrom 2004 to 2015, 1,543 cases of gastric cancer were observed in the male participants, as compared with 1,174 of expected cases, which yielded an SIR of 1.314 (95% CI, 1.249 to 1.380). Under dust exposure, the risk of gastric cancer was increased 23.9% in the male participants (95% CI, 19.9 to 27.5), and the degree of impairment of lung function was inversely related to the risk of gastric cancer.\\nWorkers with occupational dust exposure were at higher risk of developing gastric cancer than the general population. Thus, future efforts for the prevention of gastric cancer are necessary for dust exposed workers. None  Fluorescence molecular endoscopy (FME) is an emerging technique in the field of gastroenterology that holds potential to improve diagnosis and guide therapy, by serving as a \\'red-flag\\' endoscopic imaging technique. Here, we investigated the safety, feasibility and optimal method of administration of EMI-137, targeting c-Met, during FME in Barrett\\'s Esophagus (BE) and report several outcome parameters for early phase FME studies.  Extracapsular extension (ECE) of lymph node may have important prognostic impact for patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach, but it generally is ignored in staging systems and prognostic models. This study aimed to examine the impact that ECE of lymph node has on prognosis for patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach.\\nThe study analyzed 321 consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy between January 2008 and December 2015. None of these patients had distant metastases. Lymph node metastases were found in 187 patients. The ECE grade was evaluated according to the previously described system used in head and neck cancers. Deposits of cancer cells in sub-serosal fat without a recognizable lymph node were classified as ECE grade 4. Survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. A nomogram was constructed using identified significant prognostic factors. The predictive accuracy and model performance were measured by the concordance index (C-index).\\nPatients with ECE(+) showed significantly worse 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than those without ECE. In the sensitivity analysis, ECE had independent prognostic value for both 3-year OS and 3-year DFS, whereas ECE grading showed little impact on mortality trend or disease progression trend. The ECE-based nomogram showed a significantly higher C-index than the pathological tumor and node staging (pTN) staging system.\\nThe adverse prognostic impact of ECE was validated. Sub-serosal tumor deposits without recognizable lymph node tissue are recommended for inclusion in the ECE definition. A nomogram involving ECE could provide better individual prediction of survival for patients with lymph node-positive gastric cancer. To examine the temporal relationship between malignancies and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) and its impact on mortality.\\nA retrospective cohort for IIM patients was conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance Service databases. We observed more than 5\\xa0years before and after the diagnosis of IIM (2002~2016) to identify IIM patients who developed any malignancy and classified these patients into two groups: the cancer-associated myositis (CAM) group, who developed malignancy within 3\\xa0years before or after the diagnosis of IIM and the cancer-not-associated myositis (CNAM) group, who developed malignancy beyond 3\\xa0years of IIM onset. The survival rates of the two groups were compared.\\nWe identified 1072 incident cases of IIM between 2007 and 2011. A total 225 patients of these patients were diagnosed with malignancy. The development of malignancy was frequent within 1\\xa0year before and after the time of IIM diagnosis. The common sites of malignancies in the CAM group differed from those in the CNAM group: the lung, hematologic malignancy, and the liver were common in both groups, but thyroid and oropharynx followed them in CAM while prostate, stomach, breast, and thyroid followed them in CNAM. CAM patient mortality was worse compared with CNAM patients (log-rank test, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01).\\nAmong IIM patients with malignancy, common sites of malignancy were different between the CAM and CNAM groups, and patients with CAM had poor prognosis compared with CNAM patients. Key Points • The malignancies commonly occurred in incident idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) patients, especially within 1\\xa0year before and after the initial IIM diagnosis. • Patients with malignancy had poor survival compared with patients without malignancy. • Among the IIM patients with malignancy, patients who developed malignancy within 3\\xa0years of IIM diagnosis (cancer-associated myositis, or CAM, group) showed higher mortality than cancer-not-associated myositis, CNAM group. • We also found that the common types of malignancy were different between the CAM and CNAM groups. This study aimed to investigate the sufficient (≥\\u200916) lymph node assessment in 449 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and literature review.\\nFour hundred and forty-nine patients with pathologically confirmed locoregional invasive gastric adenocarcinoma from 2004 to 2013 were included. A standard surgical resection was performed for all the patients with (n\\xa0=\\u200916) or without (n\\xa0=\\u2009433) neoadjuvant treatment.\\nIn this study, 301 men and 148 women with a median age of 58 (range 21-88) years were included. The median total numbers of examined lymph nodes were 9 (range 0-55). Ninety-five patients (21.2%) had adequate (≥\\u200916) lymph node examination, and 70 patients (15.6%) had no examined lymph nodes. In univariate analysis, total or near total gastrectomy (P\\xa0<\\u2009\\xa00.001), advanced node stage (P\\xa0<\\u20090.001), primary tumor size >\\u20096\\u2009cm (P\\xa0<\\u20090.001), and the presence of perineural invasion (P\\xa0=\\u20090.039) were associated with more average number of examined lymph nodes. On multivariate analysis, node stage (P\\xa0<\\u20090.001) and type of surgery (P\\xa0=\\u20090.008) were independent predictive factors.\\nIn this study, approximately one in five patients with gastric adenocarcinoma had sufficient lymph node assessment. More studies are suggested for identifying a true inadequate lymph node dissection from insufficient lymph node assessment. Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) is a transcription factor that has an important role in stem cell differentiation and self-renewal. Oct4 has also been implicated in tumorigenicity of different cancers. This study aimed to analyze Oct4 expression in gastric carcinoma (GC) and to evaluate the relation between Oct4 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, tumor proliferation, and angiogenesis in addition to patient survival.\\nOct4 mRNA was detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in 45 GC specimens and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. We found a significant difference in Oct4 mRNA relative expression levels in GC tissue compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to study the Oct4 expression in GC cases. High Oct4 immunostaining was detected in 62.2% of GC specimens. High Oct4 expression both by mRNA relative quantitation and IHC were significantly related to poorly differentiated tumors, nodal metastasis, and stage III tumors. Moreover, high Oct4 IHC expression was also associated with cases positive for Ki-67 and VEGF expressions (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 and 0.021, respectively). Oct4 expression identified by both mRNA relative quantitation and IHC was significantly related (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). As regards patient survival, high Oct4 expression was significantly related to poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p\\u2009=\\u20090.029 and 0.031, respectively).\\nOct4 plays a valuable role in the progression and prognosis of GC. High Oct4 expression is associated with high tumor grade, nodal metastasis, stage III tumors, and poor OS and DFS. High Oct4 is also significantly associated with Ki-67 and VGEF expression, thus enhancing tumor proliferation and angiogenesis. 幽门螺杆菌（Hp）感染被认为是非贲门胃癌的最重要的可控危险因素。我国属于Hp感染及胃癌高发区，现就临床工作中常见的Hp感染处理、Hp感染状态的内镜下诊断、Hp与胃癌关系、不同胃癌风险等级的慢性胃炎患者胃镜筛查间隔、早期胃癌内镜表现、除菌后胃癌等问题进行阐述。. Specific risk factors for gastroduodenal surgery in cirrhotic patients have been identified, which dictates for a more personalized management. The retrospective study was conducted between 2012-2019 on twelve patients (7 cases of duodenal ulcer, 2 cases of gastric ulcer and 3 patients with gastric cancer). We took into account a number of possible factors involved in the unfavorable evolution of patients, based on data published in the literature so far. In order to follow the involvement of each factor we compared two groups of patients, one with unfavorable evolutions, exitus and another with favorable evolutions. Emergency surgery, the presence of ascites at the time of intervention, a higher than 30 MELD score, alcoholic cirrhosis, liver encephalopathy and liver failure are common factors that are found in a high percentage (between 75% and 100%) in patients who have had an unfavorable evolution, exitus. The same risk factors are found in much lower percentages in patients who have evolved favorably postoperatively, most between 12.5% and 25%. We analyzed preoperative aspects, surgical approach, complications and risk factors for these patients, compared them with the results of our study and identified future therapeutic possibilities. For CHILD B or C patients, the indication for surgery should be discussed in advance with a multidisciplinary team. Endoscopic submucosal dissection or discontinuation of D2 dissection should be considered in these patients. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, and the progression of gastric carcinogenesis (GCG) covers multiple complicated pathological stages. Molecular mechanisms of GCG are still unclear. Here, we undertook NMR-based metabolomic analysis of aqueous metabolites extracted from gastric tissues in an established rat model of GCG. We showed that the metabolic profiles were clearly distinguished among 5 histologically classified groups: control, gastritis, low-grade gastric dysplasia, high-grade gastric dysplasia (HGD), and GC. Furthermore, we carried out metabolic pathway analysis based on identified significant metabolites and revealed significantly disturbed metabolic pathways closely associated with the 4 pathological stages, including oxidation stress, choline phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, Krebs cycle, and glycolysis. Three metabolic pathways were continually disturbed during the progression of GCG, including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, glutamine and glutamate metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Both the Krebs cycle and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were profoundly impaired in both the HGD and GC stages, potentially due to abnormal energy supply for tumor cell proliferation and growth. Furthermore, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and glycolysis were significantly disturbed in the GC stage for higher energy requirement of the rapid growth of tumor cells. Additionally, we identified potential gastric tissue biomarkers for metabolically discriminating the 4 pathological stages, which also showed good discriminant capabilities for their serum counterparts. This work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of GCG and is of benefit to the exploration of potential biomarkers for clinically diagnosing and monitoring the progression of GCG. The genus Achillea L. is rich in bioactive sesquiterpenes and flavonoids; most of the studied species exhibit several biological activities and are used as emmenagogue, wound healing and analgesic agents. Some species are also used in local folklore medicine.\\nFollowing a literature survey, we discuss the anti-cancer properties of Achillea species, taking into consideration ethnopharmacological data on their use in traditional medicine for the treatment of cancer. In addition, we screened extracts and isolated secondary metabolites from A. coarctata for cytotoxicity, upon information based on local traditional medicine. The plant was collected in Kozani (Northern Greece), where it is locally used for treating gastrointestinal disorders, including stomach cancer.\\nA selection of the relevant data was performed through a search in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases. In addition, extracts and isolated compounds from A. coarctata were tested for their in vitro activity against the human cancer cell lines MCF-7 and HeLa.\\nThe genus Achillea L. is a valuable source of bioactive secondary metabolites. The most significant outcome of the investigation of medicinal plants is the documentation and the assessment of the traditional information and its use and perspectives in the light of modern pharmacology. Gastric bronchogenic cysts (BCs) are extremely rare cystic masses caused by abnormal development of the respiratory system during the embryonic period. Gastric bronchial cysts are rare lesions first reported in 1956; as of 2019, only 37 cases are available in the MEDLINE/PubMed online databases. BCs usually have no clinical symptoms in the early stage, and their imaging findings also lack specificity. Therefore, they are difficult to diagnose before histopathological examination.\\nA 55-year-old woman presented at our hospital with intermittent epigastric pain. She had a slightly high level of serum carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA 72-4). Endoscopic ultrasound found that a cystic mass originated from the submucosa of the posterior gastric wall near the cardia, indicating a diagnosis of cystic hygroma of the stomach. Furthermore, a computed tomography scan demonstrated a quasi-circular cystic mass closely related to the lesser curvature of the gastric fundus with a low density. Because the imaging examinations did not suggest a malignancy and the patient required complete resection, she underwent laparoscopic surgery. As an intraoperative finding, this cystic lesion was located in the posterior wall of the fundus and contained some yellow viscous liquid. Finally, the pathologists verified that the cyst in the fundus was a gastric BC. The patient recovered well with normal CA 72-4 levels, and her course was uneventful at 10 mo.\\nThis is a valuable report as it describes an extremely rare case of gastric BC. Moreover, this is the first case of BC to present with elevated CA 72-4 levels. Understanding the genetic basis of cancer risk is a major international endeavor. The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in late 2000\\'s has further accelerated the discovery of many cancer susceptibility genes. The use of targeted NGS-based multigene testing panels to provide comprehensive analysis of cancer susceptible genes has proven to be a viable option, with the accurate and robust detection of a wide range of clinically relevant variants in the targeted genes being crucial.\\nWe have developed and validated a targeted NGS-based test for hereditary cancer risk assessment using Illumina\\'s NGS platform by analyzing the protein-coding regions of 35 hereditary cancer genes with a bioinformatics pipeline that utilizes standard practices in the field. This 35-gene hereditary cancer panel is designed to identify germline cancer-causing mutations for 8 different cancers: breast, ovarian, prostate, uterine, colorectal, pancreatic, stomach cancers and melanoma. The panel was validated using well-characterized DNA specimens [NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository], where DNA had been extracted using blood of individuals whose genetic variants had been previously characterized by the 1000 Genome Project and the Coriell Catalog.\\nThe 35-gene hereditary cancer panel shows high sensitivity (99.9%) and specificity (100%) across 4820 variants including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indel; up to 25\\u2009bp). The reproducibility and repeatability are 99.8 and 100%, respectively.\\nThe use of targeted NGS-based multigene testing panels to provide comprehensive analysis of cancer susceptible genes has been considered a viable option. In the present study, we developed and validated a 35-gene panel for testing 8 common cancers using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The performance of our hereditary cancer panel is assessed across a board range of variants in the 35 genes to support clinical use. Immunotherapy has been described as the \"fourth pillar\" of oncology treatment, in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, the role of immunotherapy in gastrointestinal tumours is still evolving. Data for checkpoint inhibition in esophagogastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and anal squamous cell carcinomas are expanding. In phase iii trials in the second-line setting, PD-1 inhibitors have demonstrated positive results for the subset of esophageal cancers that are positive for PD-L1 at a combined positive score of 10 or more. Based on results of phase ii trials, PD-1 inhibitors were approved in North America for use in PD-L1-positive chemorefractory gastric cancers, in hepatocellular carcinoma after sorafenib exposure, and in treatment-refractory deficient mismatch repair (dmmr) or high microsatellite instability (msi-h) tumours, regardless of tissue site. Combination use of PD-1 and ctla-4 inhibitors has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for chemorefractory dmmr or msi-h colorectal cancer. Responses to checkpoint inhibition are durable, particularly in the dmmr or msi-h colorectal cancer cohort. As trials of combination immunotherapy, immunotherapy in combination with other systemic therapies, and immunotherapy in combination with other treatment modalities move forward in multiple tumour sites, cautious optimism is called for. The treatment landscape is continually changing, and expanded indications are likely to be just around the corner. Survival outcomes are still far from being satisfactory in patients with advanced gastric cancer, despite availability of novel chemotherapeutic regimens.\\nThis study evaluated the outcomes of patients with advanced gastric cancer who received chemotherapy along with additional treatment modalities targeting multiple tumor cell vulnerabilities.\\nA total of 24 patients diagnosed with stage III-IV locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma that received metabolically supported chemotherapy (MSCT) combined with ketogenic diet, local hyperthermia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) between April 2014 and October 2017 were included in this retrospective study. Survival outcomes were evaluated.\\nIn 22 patients (88.0%), complete response was achieved. Mean duration of follow-up was 23.9 ± 12.7 months. Mean overall survival was 39.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.1-51.0) and mean progression free survival was 36.5 months (95% CI: 25.7-47.2). No problems were encountered due to fasting, hypoglycemia, ketogenic diet, hyperthermia or HBOT.\\nThe combination treatment used in this study (MSCT together with a ketogenic diet, hyperthermia and HBOT) appears to be promising in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Further research and comparative clinical trials are warranted to support and standardize this novel treatment protocol. None Gastric cancer (GC) patients with PD-L1-negative tumor occasionally have a favorable response to anti-PD-1 mAb. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism and immunosuppressive role of PD-L2 in GC.\\nWe used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of PD-L2 in primary tumors from 194 patients with GC. The mechanism of PD-L2 expression was assessed in TCGA stomach adenocarcinoma tissue dataset and in vitro assay using GC cell lines. The immunosuppressive role of PD-L2 was evaluated by cytotoxicity of CTL clone against PD-L2 expressing GC cells.\\nPD-L2 was expressed on tumor cells (TCs) of 28.4% patients and PD-L2 expression on TCs was significantly associated with tumor progression. TCGA dataset revealed that IFN-γ and, to a lesser extent, IL-4 signature significantly correlated with PD-L2 expression. In vitro assay showed that IFN-γ and, also to a lesser extent, IL-4 can upregulate PD-L2 expression on GC cells. Anti-PD-L2 mAb significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CTL clone against GC cell lines expressing PD-L2.\\nPD-L2 is expressed on GC cells and PD-1/PD-L2 interaction are functionally involved in anti-tumor CTL activities. PD-L2 expression should be considered when determining the optimal immunotherapy for GC. Thrombosis internal jugular vein (IJV) with cervical adenopathy, as first manifestation of gastric cancer is rare. We aimed to compare resection of the cervical mass followed by gastrectomy with gastrectomy alone.\\nNine patients presenting thrombosis of the IJV for gastric carcinoma were divided into two groups. Patients in group A (n=3) underwent anticoagulation treatment, gastrectomy and adjuvant treatment. Patients in group B (n=6) underwent resection of the cervical mass and internal jugular vein (radical neck dissection), and then gastrectomy and adjuvant treatment.\\nMedian survival was 15.3 months in group A (range=11-19 months) and 31.2 months in group B (range=7-44 months) (p=0.11). Late cervical recurrence/complications occurred in 2 patients in group A and none in group B (p=0.02).\\nResection of thrombosed IJV and satellite lymph nodes, due to a primary gastric cancer may contribute to diagnosis of the disease, limit pulmonary embolic complications and improve quality of life. The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging causative agent that was first described in late December 2019 and causes a severe respiratory infection in humans. Notably, many of affected patients of COVID-19 were people with malignancies. Moreover, cancer has been identified as an individual risk factor for COVID-19. In addition, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of COVID-19, were aberrantly expressed in many tumors. However, a systematic analysis of ACE2 aberration remained to be elucidated in human cancers. Here, we analyzed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of ACE2 across over 30 tumors. Notably, overexpression of ACE2 have been observed in including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In addition, hypo DNA methylation of ACE2 has also been identified in most of these ACE2 highly expressed tumors. Conclusively, our study for the first time curated both genetic and epigenetic variations of ACE2 in human malignancies. Notably, because our study is a bioinformatics assay, further functional and clinical validation is warranted. A five-compartmental biokinetic model of I-131 radioiodine based on in-vivo gamma camera scanning results was developed and successfully applied to nine thyroid cancer patients who were administered 1,110 MBq I-131 in capsules for the residual thyroid gland ablation. The I-131 solution activity among internal organs was analyzed via the revised biokinetic model of iodine recommended by the ICRP-30 and -56 reports. Accordingly, a five-compartmental (stomach, body fluid, thyroid, whole body, and excretion) model was established to simulate the metabolic mechanism of I-131 in thyroid cancer patients, whereas the respective four simultaneous differential equations were solved via a self-developed program run in MATLAB. This made it possible to provide a close correlation between MATLAB simulation results and empirical data. The latter data were collected through in-vivo gamma camera scans of nine patients obtained after 1, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours after radioactive I-131 administration. The average biological half-life values for the stomach, body fluid, thyroid, and whole body of thyroid cancer patients under study were 0.54±0.32, 12.6±1.8, 42.8±5.1, and 12.6±1.8 h, respectively. The corresponding branching ratios I12, I23, I25, I34, I42, and I45 as denoted in the biokinetic model of iodine were 1.0, 0.21±0.14, 0.79±0.14, 1.0, 0.1, and 0.9, respectively. The average values of the AT dimensionless index used to verify the agreement between empirical and numerical simulation results were 0.056±0.017, 0.017±0.014, 0.044±0.023, and 0.045±0.009 for the stomach, thyroid, body fluid + whole body, and total, respectively. The results obtained were considered quite instrumental in the elucidation of metabolic mechanisms in the human body, particularly in thyroid cancer patients. We describe a novel esophagogastric anastomotic technique (\"side-to-side: staple line-on-staple line\", STS) for intrathoracic anastomoses designed to create a large diameter anastomosis while simultaneously maintaining conduit blood supply. This technique aims to minimize the incidence of anastomotic leaks and strictures, which is a frequent source of morbidity and occasional mortality after esophagectomy. We analyze the results of this STS technique on 368 patients and compared outcomes to 112 patients who underwent esophagogastric anastomoses using an end-to-end stapler (EEA) over an 8-year time interval at our institution. The STS technique involves aligning the remaining intrathoracic esophagus over the tip of the lesser curve staple line of a stomach tube, created as a replacement conduit for the esophagus. A linear stapling device cuts through and restaples the conduit staple line to the lateral wall of the esophagus in a side-to-side fashion. The open common lumen is then closed in two layers of sutures. There was a total of 12 (3.8%) anastomotic leaks in patients who underwent STS esophagogastric anastomosis. Two of eight patients (25%) had anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy for end-stage achalasia as compared to a 2.8% leak rate (10/336) after esophagectomy for other conditions. Eighteen (5.2%) patients required a median of 2 dilatations for anastomotic stricture after STS anastomosis. Supplemental jejunostomy feedings were required in only 11.1% of patients undergoing STS anastomoses following hospital discharge. In contrast, patients undergoing EEA anastomoses demonstrated anastomotic leak and stricture rates of 16.1% and 14.3% respectively (p<0.01). Time analysis of postoperative contrast studies following the STS technique typically demonstrated a straight/uniform diameter conduit with essentially complete contrast emptying into the small bowel within 3 minutes in 88.4% of patients. The incidence of esophagogastric anastomotic leaks and strictures were extremely low using this novel anastomotic technique. Additionally we believe that based on time and qualitative analyses of postoperative contrast studies, this technique appears to optimize postoperative upper gastrointestinal tract function; however, further comparative studies are needed. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infects the stomach of about half of the human population and is strongly associated with the risk of gastric cancer (GC) and its premalignant precursors. The cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) is a region of the Hp genome encoding for key molecular machinery involved in the infection process. Following a sequencing study, we selected 50 genetic polymorphisms located in seven cagPAI genes and tested their associations with the risk of advanced gastric premalignant lesions and GC in 1220 subjects from various Latin American populations showing the whole spectrum of phenotypes from gastritis to GC. We found that three polymorphisms of cagA are associated with the risk of advanced gastric premalignant lesions (incomplete intestinal metaplasia [ie, Type 2 and 3] or dysplasia), and that six polymorphisms located in cagA, cagL and cagI were associated with risk of GC. When corrected for multiple testing none of the associations were statistically significant. However, scores built by integrating the individual polymorphisms were significantly associated with the risk of advanced gastric premalignant lesions and GC. These results have the potential of establishing markers for risk stratification in the general population, in view of targeting Hp eradication to high-risk population groups. Searching for the novel tumour biomarkers is pressing for gastric cancer diagnostication and prognostication. The serum specimens from patients diagnosed with locally advanced gastric carcinoma before operation and 4\\xa0week after surgery were collected, respectively, and serum proteome profiling was conducted by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS. Fifty-five proteins were identified to be up-regulated and 16 proteins were down-regulated, and these differentially expressed proteins participated in various biological processes. Serum levels of SOX3, one of down-regulated proteins, in stomach cancer patients were higher than in healthy controls. SOX3 levels in cancer tissues were remarkably related to tumour differentiation, lymph node metastasis, primary tumour invasion and pTNM\\xa0(pathological TNM) stage. Analysis with The Cancer Genome Atlas database indicated that SOX3 level and pTNM stage were the independent risk factors for the patient survival and that the overall survival was negatively associated with the SOX3 levels. Loss-of-function showed that SOX3 promoted gastric cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. SOX3 silence inhibits the expression of MMP9, and SOX3 is responsible for MMP9 expression transcriptionally. Our study highlights the potentiality of the paired pre- and post-operation serum proteome signatures for the detection of biomarkers and reveals that SOX3 may serve as a candidate prognosis marker for gastric cancer. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy for liver metastatic recurrence in gastric cancer patients.\\nConsecutive patients who underwent proton beam therapy from 2010 to 2015 were isolated from our institutional database. Patients with extrahepatic metastatic lesions were excluded. Seven patients were enrolled. The median diameter of target lesions was 31\\xa0mm (13-68\\xa0mm). The most frequent dosage was 72.6\\xa0Gy equivalent in 22 fractions. The effectiveness was assessed based on the local control, overall survival and progression-free survival rates. The local control, overall survival and progression-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Adverse events were described according to the patients\\' medical records.\\nThe median follow-up period was 41.7\\xa0months (20.7-66.3\\xa0months). The 3-year local control, overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 85.7, 68.6 and 43%, respectively. All patients completed proton beam therapy without interruption. No grade ≥3 adverse events were observed.\\nProton beam therapy might be a treatment option for patients with liver metastasis of gastric cancer. Lymphoproliferative malignancies can involve both nodal- and extra-nodal tissues. The most common extranodal site involved is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and it is secondary to the widespread primary nodal disease. However, about 33% of non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma primarily arise from tissues other than lymph nodes, spleen, or bone marrow, for example, GI tract, skin, or the central nervous system and are called primary extranodal lymphomas. The most common site of GI localization is stomach (50%-60%) followed by small bowel. Primary colonic lymphoma is seen only in 6% of GI lymphomas and up to 0.5%-1% of all colon malignancies. Hence, primary GI lymphoma is extremely rare, and primary colonic lymphoma is an even rarer occurrence. There is clearly a paucity of cases reported in literature resulting in unclear treatment protocol. Here, we report a case of a 51-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and bright red blood per rectum. A colonoscopy revealed diffuse bleeding ulcers involving the entire colon. Pathology was consistent with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma arising from the colon. The patient was started on treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment plays an important role in the decision-making process in oncology.\\nThe aim of the study was to translate European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) OES18 and OG25 in Punjabi language for HRQOL assessment of patients diagnosed with esophagus and esophagogastric malignancies.\\nThe EORTC translation guidelines were duly followed to translate QLQ-OES18 and OG25 into Punjabi language. Each set of questionnaire was independently translated by two forward translators, followed by backward translation of the reconciled version by two independent translators. The final version was submitted to the EORTC Translation Team and served to the patients for the pilot testing.\\nThe questionnaire was administered to ten patients each of esophagus and esophagogastric malignancies who were evaluated and treated at our hospital. Every patient underwent an interview to check if any of the questions was difficult, uncomfortable, or upsetting to answer. Their concerns were recorded as per the template provided by the EORTC team and due changes done if required.\\nThe EORTC QLQ-OES18 and OG25 questionnaire has been translated to Punjabi language and subsequently approved for usage. The clinicomorphology and immunohistochemical features of T-cell lymphomas have been documented.\\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the spectrum of clincopathological features of T-cell lymphoma with immunohistochemistry correlation in a tertiary care center.\\nThe present study was conducted on 19 biopsy specimens received from the Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, from referral hospitals of Mangalore city. Cases of nodal and extranodal T-cell lymphomas diagnosed between January 2012 and December 2015 were selected with evaluation of clinical data, histomorphological features, and immunophenotyping. Appropriate panel of antibodies was chosen after morphological evaluation of the cases.\\nOf the 19 cases of T-cell lymphomas, 14 were nodal disease and 5 were extranodal disease. Among the nodal lymphomas, five were primary peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), four were cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma, three were cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas, and two were cases of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) negative. In extranodal disease, two were mycosis fungoides of skin, one case each of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma of tonsil, and T-cell lymphoma of the stomach.\\nThe diagnosis and subclassification of PTCLs is necessary for therapeutic and prognostic purposes. Evidence has shown that miRNAs can be regulated by multiple mechanisms and can participate in tumorigenesis and progression through binding to 3\\'-UTRs of target mRNAs. The present study identified differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs, and TFs by analyzing miRNA-Seq and mRNA-Seq data to construct a TFs/miRNAs/mRNAs regulation network for GC. We found five miRNAs (miR-18a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-196b-5p) that were significantly overexpressed in GC tissues. Clinical analyses indicated that higher miR-21-5p expression was associated with T3\\xa0+\\xa0T4 and stage III\\xa0+\\xa0IV. The expression of miR-96-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-196b-5p were positively correlated with the patients\\' ages. The five miRNAs had diagnostic efficacy in distinguishing GC from normal tissues. The gene interaction network showed that the five miRNAs were transcriptionally regulated by 11 TFs and negatively regulated 53 mRNA expressions through binding to the 3\\'-UTRs. Biological pathway analysis suggested that these TFs and target genes were involved in the p53 pathway, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, ErbB receptor, mTOR, VEGF, and VEGFR signaling networks. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that these genes were enriched in some cancer-associated pathways, including in GC. The five miRNAs may act as potential diagnostic markers and the TFs/miRNAs/mRNAs network could suggest a regulation mechanism of miRNAs. Several long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been linked to carcinogenesis; however, little is known about the role of LINC00619 in gastric cancer (GC). LINC00619 was identified among differentially expressed lncRNAs linked to gastric cancer based on microarray analysis and its relationships with miR-224-5p and opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like gene (OPCML) were investigated. LINC00619, miR-224-5p, and OPCML expression were measured in GC tissues and cells. Ectopic expression and depletion experiments were conducted to assess the effects of LINC00619, miR-224-5p and OPCML on cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis as well as their effects on the expression of apoptosis- and metastasis-related genes (Bcl-2, Bax, MMP-2 and MMP-9). Tumorigenicity in the nude mice was also examined. Gastric cancer was characterized by downregulation of LINC00619 and OPCML and upregulation of miR-224-5p. Additionally, we found that miR-224-5p could interact with both LINC00619 and OPCML. Upregulation of LINC00619, which binds to miR-224-5p, led to decreased miR-224-5p expression while increasing the expression of OPCML, a target gene of miR-224-5p. Overexpression of LINC00619 or OPCML or downregulation of miR-224-5p suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, migration and tumorigenicity while promoting apoptosis in GC. Our results indicated that LINC00619 functions as a tumor suppressor in GC by impairing miR-224-5p-mediated inhibition of OPCML. Gastric cancer is one of the most aggressive tumors, usually resulting in metastasis, and therapies for advanced gastric cancer remain limited. Drug resistance is the main reason for chemotherapeutic failure in gastric cancer. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 3 (WASF3) is required for invasion and metastasis of different cancers. However, there has been little study of WASF3 expression involvement in gastric cancer. In this study, we explored the role of WASF3 in the sensitivity of gastric cancer to oxaliplatin, and the underlying mechanisms.\\nWe silenced WASF3 using WASF3-siRNA in MGC803 cells. Then, CCK-8, flow cytometry and transwell assay were performed to study the effect of WASF3 silencing on proliferation, migration, invasiveness and apoptosis of MGC803 cells. Moreover, we evaluated the potential mechanism in vitro to determine the sensitization to oxaliplatin induced by WASF3.\\nWASF3 silencing by small interfering RNA inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of gastric cancer cells. We also observed that WASF3 knockdown promoted cell apoptosis and enhanced oxaliplatin sensitivity. Furthermore, the sensitization to oxaliplatin induced by WASF3 knockdown depended on the inhibition of Atg12-mediated autophagy.\\nOur analysis demonstrates WASF3 targeting is a new potential therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer. The lymphatic flow around the esophagogastric junction is complicated. Therefore, it is unclear whether lymphatic invasion in the esophageal region (eLI) and in the gastric region (gLI) in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) equally affect the incidence of lymph node metastases (LNM), and consequently, survival.\\nWe retrospectively reviewed clinicopathological data of 175 patients with AEG between January 2008 and July 2017. Risk factors for LNM and impacts of eLI or gLI on survival outcomes were investigated.\\neLI was identified in 34% of the patients (59/175). By multivariate analysis, eLI was associated with an increased risk of both mediastinal LNM (odds ratio [OR]\\u2009=\\u20092.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26-7.05) and abdominal LNM (OR\\u2009=\\u20095.44, 95% CI: 1.95-15.20). The 5-year overall survival for patients with eLI (53%) was significantly worse than for patients without eLI (76%) (hazard ratio\\u2009=\\u20092.45, 95% CI: 1.37-10.01). gLI was not selected in either of these analyses.\\nPositive eLI was strongly associated with mediastinal and abdominal LNM and worse survival in patients with AEG compared with gLI. In the histopathological examination, it seems to make sense to assess eLI and gLI separately. Cancer is still a major health problem in China although numerous efforts have been made for its prevention and control. Findings from this study showed that lung cancer remains the most common type of cancer diagnosed, and was attributed to nearly 30% of all cancer-related deaths. The incidence of the five most common cancers, in China, in 2015, including cancers of the lungs, stomach, colorectum, liver and breast, accounted for almost 60% of all cancers diagnosed. The high cancer burden in China highlights the need for further improvement in health education, professional training and the building up an anti-cancer network for introducing and implementing sustainable actions for cancer control. The causes of death in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma have not been well characterized. This nationwide population-based cohort study included 56\\xa0240 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma in 1970-2014 in Sweden. We used competing-risks regression to compare cause-specific risks of death in patients with different characteristics and a multiple-cause approach to assess proportions of deaths attributable to each cause. Among 53\\xa0049 deaths, gastric cancer was the main (77.7% of all deaths) underlying cause. Other major underlying causes were nongastric malignancies (8.0%), ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease (6.5%), and respiratory diseases (1.4%). Risk of death from gastric cancer steadily decreased in patients with cardia adenocarcinoma over the study period, but remained relatively stable in patients with noncardia adenocarcinoma since the 1980s. Risk of death from other malignancies increased during later calendar periods (subhazard ratio [SHR]\\xa0=\\xa02.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97-2.38, comparing 2001-2014 with 1970-1980). Compared with men, the risk of death in women with cardia adenocarcinoma was higher from gastric cancer (SHR\\xa0=\\xa01.18, 95% CI 1.10-1.27), but lower from other malignancies (SHR\\xa0=\\xa00.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.91). In multiple-cause models, 60.4%-71.2% of all deaths were attributable to gastric cancer and 9.5%-12.1% to other malignancies. The temporal trends of cause-specific risks from multiple-cause models were similar to those of underlying causes. Our findings suggest that although most deaths in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma are due to gastric cancer, other causes of death are common. Patients with cardia adenocarcinoma face considerable increasing risk of death from other causes over time, particularly from other malignancies. The number of bariatric surgical procedures performed worldwide increases every year and has recently exceeded 685,000. Over 50% of these are laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass accounts for an additional 30%. Bariatric/metabolic surgery seeks to achieve not only weight loss and the remission of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus type II, arterial hypertension, sleep apnea, risk of cancer, non-alcoholic liver steatosis, etc., but also improvements in the patient\\'s quality of life. SG is mainly a restrictive procedure consisting of the resection and removal of a major part of the stomach, which has an additional impact on hormones such as Ghrelin and Glucagon-like Peptide 1. The first part of this article focuses on patient preparation before a bariatric procedure with mandatory and additional examinations to decrease the patient\\'s risk. Next, the surgical technique itself, including positioning of the patient, positioning of the trocars and related tips and tricks, and the postoperative course are described. The second part discusses the outcomes of SG, including weight loss, remission of comorbidities and quality of life. Further possible acute complications of SG such as leaks, bleeding or stenoses as well as long-term complications (reflux, weight regain and malnutrition) and respective treatments are also described. In conclusion, SG is an effective procedure for weight loss with a low risk for the patient to develop malnutrition. In terms of post-operative care, regular check-ups are vital to ensure a positive outcome as well as for the early detection of possible issues. Reflux and weight regain are common issues with SG in a long-term follow-up; thus, patients should be selected carefully for this procedure. There is no definite evidence of the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) for patients who have undergone incomplete endoscopic resection (ER). We investigated the influence of ER prior to LDG by a propensity score matching analysis.\\nWe retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of gastric cancer patients who underwent LDG with or without prior ER from 2000 to 2014. Propensity score matching was performed to compare the two groups of patients.\\nAfter matching, 47 patients in the ER group and 94 patients in the non-ER group were selected from a total of 365 patients. A residual tumor was observed in 10 of 47 patients (21.3%). The mean number of dissected lymph nodes in the non-ER group (39.4\\u2009±\\u200914.5) was higher than that in the ER group (31.7\\u2009±\\u200913.5) (P\\u2009=\\u20090.003). However, other perioperative data, such as the operation time and blood loss volume were similar. The complication rate of the ER group (17.0%) and the non-ER group (9.6%) did not differ to a statistically significant extent (P\\u2009=\\u20090.2). Among these patients, 6 died during the 5-year follow-up period, but no patients showed signs of recurrence.\\nER prior to surgical resection showed no significant influence on postoperative complications or mortality. LDG can be safely performed to achieve radical resection after incomplete ER. Complications such as severe infection may occur during the chemotherapy of malignant lymphoma. Phlegmonous gastritis (PG) is a rare acute bacterial infection associated with high mortality, requiring early diagnosis, and prompt management. In addition, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) occasionally requires early treatment and intensive care management due to the occurrence of severe neuropathy and respiratory failure.\\nA 70-year-old male was diagnosed with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after the detection of several polypoid tumors with ulcers. The patient underwent chemotherapy for DLBCL and exhibited adverse effects (i.e., fever, vomiting, epigastric pain, and neutropenia). Computed tomography indicated widespread thickening in the gastric wall. Furthermore, approximately 2 weeks later, the patient presented with gradual symmetric lower extremity weakness and respiratory failure due to paralysis of the respiratory muscle.\\nDLBCL was diagnosed through a gastric tumor biopsy. On the basis of the computed tomography findings, a culture of gastric juice, nerve conduction studies, and clinical symptoms, this case of gastric lymphoma was complicated with PG and GBS.\\nThe patient was treated with antimicrobial therapy and administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for PG, and with intravenous immunoglobulin and intensive care management for GBS.\\nDespite the aggressive progress of the condition, the patient improved without relapse of DLBCL.\\nPG was regarded as a precedent infection of GBS. In this article, we present the first reported case of gastric lymphoma complicated with PG and GBS. Overexpression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) has been shown for a variety of human cancers (e.g., colon, brain, breast, and kidney) and inhibition resulted in intracellular lactate accumulation, acidosis, and cell death. Thus, MCTs are promising targets to investigate tumor cancer metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET). Here, the organ doses (ODs) and the effective dose (ED) of the first  In this experimental study, 70 mice in ten groups were evaluated from July to September 2017 in the microbiology laboratory of the School of Medicine, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran. After induction of \\nBased on ELISA results and histological findings, a reduction of inflammation was observed. The group which was only exposed to \\nAccording to the results of this study, probiotic bacteria including  Standard treatment for progressive gastric cancer with bleeding includes hemostatic radiotherapy (RT); however, the only prospective study using a fixed dose with fractions during hemostatic RT did not introduce re-irradiation. Therefore, we determined the utility of RT including re-irradiation for gastric cancer.\\nIn this study, 31 patients with gastric cancer and bleeding were treated with an initial dose of 20\\u2009Gy/5 fractions for the whole stomach and a salvage dose of 15\\u2009Gy/5 fractions for the partial stomach. Patients achieving hemostasis, defined as a stable hemoglobin level within 30 days following irradiation, were considered responders, whereas those with no cessation of bleeding and those with re-bleeding within 30 days of irradiation were considered non-responders. We evaluated response rate, disease-free survival, overall survival (OS), re-irradiation, and adverse events (AEs).\\nThe response rate of initial RT was 80% (25/31). 6 of the 25 patients underwent re-irradiation, and all 6 were responders (100%). The median OS was significantly different among the entire cohort and one-time irradiation and re-irradiation groups (91, 76, and 112 days, respectively). No AEs of grade ≥3 were observed. Initial low-dose RT followed by reirradiation was effective in reducing AEs and did not cause any further AEs.\\nHemostatic RT was an effective approach with low toxicity, and re-irradiation was effective and tolerable, with no patients developing severe AEs. Further, randomized controlled studies are warranted to determine the ideal dose and number of fractions for initial RT in patients with gastric cancer and bleeding.\\nIn this prospective study on hemostatic radiotherapy for gastric cancer, the response rate was 80% using a fixed dose of 20\\u2009Gy/5 fractions and the salvage dose of 15\\u2009Gy for re-bleeding was effective. Future comparative studies should include other doses with 20\\u2009Gy as a control. The most serious problem in surgical treatment of gastric cancer includes the area of resection and the extent of lymphadenectomy. The extent of gastric resection is determined by the extent of tumor affection. The aim of radical surgical intervention is to achieve microscopically clear resection line, since R0 resection is the main criterion for the patient´s prognosis. Curative surgical resection for gastric cancer includes the lymph nodes dissection. In the treatment of gastric cancer, there are two views on the importance of lymphadenectomy. The Far East considers that operation improves the survival and the Europe considers that surgery is not curative, but it determines the staging and prognosis. There is also a difference in staging systems. The one from East is importance based on the anatomical location of affected lymph nodes, the second from Europe is based on the number of positive lymph nodes.\\nThis work is a retrospective observational study. In the study cohort, comparing the survival of patients according to different classification systems, depending on the N-stage of disease, 119 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma in clinical stage I to III, i.e. without metastasis, who underwent a radical surgical resection with D2 lymphadenectomy, were enrolled. For the evaluation of the survival versus the time after operation, we used Kaplan‒Meier method. To evaluate the correlation between the survival rate and the explanatory variables, Cox regression and Kendall correlation coefficient were used.\\nThe median survival, according to different classification systems, depending on the N-stage of the disease, was significantly correlated with the survival for the 6th and 7th editions of TNM classification system for the Japanese classification system, for N-ratio classification system).The new finding was differentiation of patients in groups N1 vs N2 under the 6th TNM classification (HR=0.910249), also a little differentiation in groups N1 vs N2 according to the classification of N-ratio (HR=0.8750926) and equally a poor differentiation in the survival in groups N2 vs N3 according to the 7th TNM classification (HR=0.881797).The strongest correlation reached the Japanese classification system, but not significantly different from the 6th TNM classification system. In the 7th edition of TNM classification system, we then found the weakest correlation with the survival time, but not significantly different from the previous two.\\nOur retrospective study confirmed the strongest correlation between the patient´s prognosis and the anatomic localization of the affected lymph nodes. This correlation was not statistically significant compared to the correlation between patient´s prognosis and the number of positive lymph nodes. It leads us to the conclusion that both classification systems are comparable and the difference is statistically insignificant (Tab. 4, Fig. 8, Ref. 16). Patients with gastric precancerous lesions (atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) have increased risk of developing gastric cancer, and adequate management and surveillance of these patients should allow to reduce gastric cancer-related mortality. The guidelines on the management of these patients have been recently published by the European Societies (MAPS II guidelines) and by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). The aim of this commentary is to compare these two guidelines by highlighting the common points and differences between them. Both guidelines recommend a systematic detection and eradication of Helicobacter pylori in all patients with gastric atrophy. However, there is a major difference in the recommendations for surveillance: while the MAPS II guidelines recommend systematic endoscopic surveillance in all patients with severe gastric atrophy (with or without intestinal metaplasia), the AGA guidelines focus only on intestinal metaplasia and plead against systematic surveillance, leaving the possibility of surveillance in individual patients based on shared decision between clinicians and patients. The difference between two guidelines comes essentially from the different arguments used by two authorities (randomized control studies by AGA and observational cohort studies by the European Societies), and may be, at least in part, related to the difference between the European and American health care systems and potential economic burden. Cancer survival is generally lower for rural compared with urban residents, but findings have been inconsistent. We aimed to assess inequalities in cancer survival by remoteness of residence in Victoria, Australia.\\nIncident cancer cases diagnosed in 2001-2015 with 30 cancer types (n\\u2009=\\u2009331,302) were identified through the Victorian Cancer Registry and followed to the end of 2015 through death registries. Five-year net survival was estimated using the Pohar-Perme method and differences assessed by excess mortality rate ratios (EMRRs) using Poisson regression, adjusting for sex, age and year of diagnosis. EMRRs adjusted for socio-economic disadvantage were also estimated.\\nPeople living outside major cities had lower survival for 11 cancers: esophagus, stomach, colorectum, liver, gallbladder/biliary tract, pancreas, lung, connective/soft tissue, ovary, prostate, kidney. No differences in survival were found for cancers of uterus, small intestine and mesothelioma. After adjusting for socio-economic disadvantage, the observed differences in survival decreased for most cancers and disappeared for colorectal cancer, but they remained largely unchanged for cancers of esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, lung, connective/soft tissue, ovary and kidney.\\nPeople with cancer residing outside major cities had lower survival from some cancers, which is partly due to the greater socio-economic disadvantage of rural residents. Although laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) is a widely accepted treatment for gastric cancer, conversion to laparotomy is sometimes required. The current study aimed to review the time trends of intraoperative conversions to open procedures during the decade in which the LG procedure was being developed.\\nCases in which LG was attempted at the Cancer Institute Hospital from 2005 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed, and the details regarding conversions to open surgery were examined.\\nTwenty-two (0.63%) of 3,498 patients required conversion to open surgery due to technical difficulties. The major reasons for conversions were difficulties in reconstruction (seven patients; 0.20%) and intraoperative bleeding (six patients; 0.17%). All conversions due to difficulties in reconstruction occurred in the introduction period of LG during the performance of esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy in laparoscopic total gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy using a circular stapler. Five (71.4%) of the seven patients in whom conversion was performed due to difficulties in reconstruction developed postoperative severe complications. No conversions due to difficulties in reconstruction have been experienced since 2011, possibly due to the decrease in the number of laparoscopic total gastrectomy procedures and the introduction of the use of a linear stapler in esophagojejunostomy. To manage intraoperative bleeding in LG, hemostatic procedures were systematized and conversions were considered if visualization was not maintained following the procedures. None of the six patients who required laparotomy due to intraoperative bleeding required surgical or radiological intervention postoperatively.\\nOver a decade of experience and procedural changes have markedly decreased the incidence of conversion to open surgery in LG. The main causes of conversion during the early period of LG introduction were difficulties in reconstruction and intraoperative bleeding; the incidences of these complications have been decreased by employing the appropriate procedures for LG. Accumulating evidence confirms the potential prognostic value of extranodal soft tissue metastasis (ESTM) in patients with solid cancers. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential relationship between ESTM and lymph node (LN) metastasis, demonstrate clinicopathological predictive prognostic factors for ESTM and LN metastasis, and identify the prognostic value of ESTM for gastric cancer (GC) patients aged under 70 years.\\nA total of 580 GC patients who underwent the curative resection between 2003 and 2011 were included to identify if ESTM is essential to improve the accuracy of prognostic evaluation of the GC patients postoperatively. Overall survival rates were tested by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to clarify the independent prognostic factors. Logistic regression analysis was adopted to clarify the risk factors for evaluating the presence of ESTM and LN metastasis. After cut-point survival analysis, the GC patients were divided into three subgroups based on the number of ESTM and then incorporated into the pTNM stage of gastric carcinoma to identify the possibility and necessity of incorporating ESTM into staging.\\nESTM was associated with advanced pT, pN and pTNM categories, large tumour size and the presence of signet-ring cell (SRC) variants. Survival analyses revealed that ESTM was associated with the OS and was an independent prognostic predictor in this GC patient cohort. Logistic regression analysis proved that ESTM and pT stage are significantly correlated with LN metastasis. Additionally, the ESTM was incorporated into the eighth edition of the pTNM classification and the prognostic evaluation of pTNME classification were calculated directly, and the results indicated that ESTM can reduce the stage migration.\\nESTM is a significant independent predictor of survival in GC patients. To achieve R0 surgery, lymph nodes, soft tissues, fascia and adipose tissue should be resected en bloc at the same time as lymph node dissection. ESTM should be incorporated into pTNM staging according to the number retrieved from postoperative samples. Early gastric cancer (EGC) with undifferentiated component (UDC) is a more aggressive entity, where the significance of preoperative data to tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis (LNM) remains unclarified.\\nA total of 5,020 GC patients undergoing radical gastrectomy in three centers were reviewed, of which, EGC with UDC in preoperative biopsy specimens were enrolled. The histology of biopsy and surgical specimens was graded according to the proportion of UDC and signet ring cells (SRCs). Risk factors of tumor invasion and LNM were evaluated with histological, clinical and demographic data.\\nLower body mass index (BMI), melena and larger tumor size were the independent preoperative risk factors of both LNM and LVI, while ulcerative lesion (UL) and the lower third stomach were only correlated with LNM. No relevance was found between the histological features of biopsy specimens and LNM, but SRC or >50% UDC lowered the risk of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and/or submucosal (SM) invasion. When surgical data (depth of invasion and LVI included) were added, lower BMI, melena and the lower third stomach were still the independent preoperative risk factors of LNM, and LVI, SRC and SM invasion also showed relevance to LNM. The performance of predictive models using pre- or postoperative histological data was comparable.\\nThe preoperative data were significantly relevant to tumor invasion and LNM, showing comparable risk strength with surgical specimens in histology. Gastric duplication cyst (GDC) with a pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelial (PCCE) is a congenital rare cystic neoplasm, which is often difficult to distinguish from other entities by imaging techniques, and as a consequence it may be wrongly overtreated. We herein report a case of a 52-year-old female incidentally found to have an abdominal mass by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Additionally, endoscopic ultrasonography and fluid analysis were consistent with a pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm with a markedly elevated fluid amylase, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9. Then, laparoscopic resection of the cyst originating from the stomach and wedge gastrectomy were performed. Final pathology revealed a GDC with PCCE. In addition, we also performed a literature review of 31 reports of GDC with PCCE. Although rare, GDC lined by PCCE should be included in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms or a gastric wall mass. We report on the unusual course of disease in three patients with gastrointestinal MALT lymphoma. Special features are the primary lymphoma manifestation, the high-grade transformation during the follow up, the long-time interval between initially curative intended therapy and relapse and the occurrence of another neoplasia in one case. This demonstrates that despite their good prognosis in general, follow-up investigations of gastrointestinal MALT lymphoma are reasonable.\\nWir berichten über den ungewöhnlichen Krankheitsverlauf von drei Patienten mit gastro-intestinalen MALT-Lymphomen. Besonderheiten sind die primäre Manifestation der Lymphome, die hochmaligne Transformation im weiteren Verlauf, der lange Zeitraum zwischen initial erfolgreicher kurativ intendierter Therapie und dem Rezidiv und das Auftreten einer weiteren Neoplasie in einem Fall. Dies zeigt, dass trotz der allgemein guten Prognose von gastrointestinalen MALT-Lymphomen Nachsorgeuntersuchungen sinnvoll sind. To compare laparoscopic manual esophagoenterostomy and esophagoenterostomy with mechanical stapling anastomotic devices after laparoscopic gastrectomy for stomach cancer.\\nThere were 34 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for stomach in 2015-2018. Roux-en-Y esophagoenterostomy was used to reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract. Manual anastomoses were performed in 18 patients (group 1), stapled anastomoses (endogia 45 mm, covidien, mansfield, ma, usa) - in 16 patients (group 2). There was no randomization. Surgery duration, length of icu-stay, terms of enteral nutrition initiation, postoperative complications, hospital-stay were analyzed.\\nMean duration of surgery in the first group was 217 (184-302) min, in the second group - 201 (162-311) min.

Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with the development of gastric cancer. Although the prevalence of gastric cancer has declined throughout years due to improvement in early screening strategy, mortality due to gastric cancer has not changed. Incidence and mortality due to gastric cancer are higher in developing countries as compared to developed countries. Diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer are still poor with patients usually diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage. Eradication of H.\\xa0pylori is pertinent for the prevention of gastric cancer. However, the rise in antimicrobial resistance among H.\\xa0pylori isolates has complicated the prevention strategy. H.\\xa0pylori express multiple virulence factors for survival in the hostile acid gastric environment. The expression of oncogenic protein cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), and outer inflammatory protein is essential for H.\\xa0pylori to exert pathogenesis towards the host. Interestingly, <3% of H.\\xa0pylori-infected subjects develop gastric cancer, suggesting a unique way of interaction between the host\\'s immune response and H.\\xa0pylori virulence factors. This article is aimed to review the epidemiology and role of H.\\xa0pylori in gastric carcinogenesis. A better understanding of the interaction between H.\\xa0pylori virulence factors and host is required for better gastric cancer prevention. None Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT lymphoma) accounts for approximately 5% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most common site of involvement. The stomach and small intestine are the most common sites of involvement in the GI tract. Colonic MALT lymphoma is a rare condition that comprises only 2.5% of MALT lymphomas and less than 0.5% of all colon cancers. They usually present as colon mass or polyps. In this case report, we present a case of colonic MALT lymphoma diagnosed on random colon biopsies which is very rare. The high mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and the limitations of conventional tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage emphasized the necessity of exploring hub genes closely related to carcinogenesis and prognosis in CRC. The study is aimed at identifying hub genes associated with carcinogenesis and prognosis for CRC. We identified and validated 212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We investigated functional enrichment analysis for DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and hub modules and genes in CRC carcinogenesis were extracted. A prognostic signature was developed and validated based on Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The DEGs mainly regulated biological processes covering response to stimulus, metabolic process, and affected molecular functions containing protein binding and catalytic activity. The DEGs played important roles in CRC-related pathways involving in preneoplastic lesions, carcinogenesis, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Hub genes closely related to CRC carcinogenesis were extracted including six genes in model 1 (CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL11, NMU, and PPBP) and two genes and Metallothioneins (MTs) in model 2 (SLC26A3 and SLC30A10). Among them, CXCL8 was also related to prognosis. An eight-gene signature was proposed comprising AMH, WBSCR28, SFTA2, MYH2, POU4F1, SIX4, PGPEP1L, and PAX5. The study identified hub genes in CRC carcinogenesis and proposed an eight-gene signature with good reproducibility and robustness at the molecular level for CRC, which might provide directive significance for treatment selection and survival prediction. Multiple primary malignancies in a single patient are exceedingly rare, but their prevalence has increased in recent decades due to prolonged survival rates supported by the advent of newer and better generation of chemotherapeutic agents as well as advances in cancer detectability facilitated by sophisticated modalities such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Here, we discuss a case of a 66-year-old male who recovered completely from lung carcinoma but subsequently developed synchronous gall bladder and gastric carcinoma after 1 year. The aim of this study was to determine whether the administration of neoadjuvant therapy (NAD) affects the incidence, timing, and pattern of recurrence in patients treated by curative gastrectomy.\\nSixty-nine patients undergoing NAD and R0 gastrectomy were compared with 198 patients undergoing upfront surgery using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) analyses were conducted with a log-rank test and Cox regression. Risk factors for recurrence were assessed by logistic regression.\\nAmong 69 patients with NAD, 28 (40.6%) experienced recurrence, and signet-ring cell (SRC) carcinoma was the only factor independently associated with recurrence. In the whole sample, NAD did not influence DFS, DSS, rate of recurrence, or PFS. After PSM, the variables associated with DFS were cN1, type of gastrectomy, the presence of SRCs, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion. Variables independently associated with recurrence were cN1, type of gastrectomy, and the presence of SRCs.\\nNAD had no impact on DFS, DSS, or the pattern of recurrence in any patients with gastric cancer. To define a better treatment strategy, future studies should focus on subtypes that do not respond to the current neoadjuvant regimens. The tumor microenvironment (TM) is an essential factor of tumor progression. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are important components of the TM and play critical roles in cancer metastasis. Resveratrol (RES) is a potential antitumor drug that has attracted extensive attention. However, it remains unclear whether RES can exert its antitumor activity by targeting MSCs located in the TM. In this study, we demonstrated that the conditioned medium of gastric-cancer-derived MSCs (GC-MSCs) promoted gastric cancer (GC) metastasis and facilitated the progression of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) of GC cells. However, after pretreatment with RES, the prometastatic effect of GC-MSCs on GC cells was reversed. Furthermore, RES reduced GC-MSC (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, VEGF) gene expression and protein secretion, and counteracted the activation of the GC-MSC-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling of GC cells, with less β-catenin nuclear transport and declined expression of β-catenin, CD44, and CyclinD3 in GC cells. Re-expression of β-catenin impaired the inhibitory effect of RES on GC cells. In conclusion, RES restricted the mobility increase of GC cells and reversed the progress of EMT induced by GC-MSCs by inactivating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. GC-MSCs are promising target for RES in the inhibition of GC metastasis. The incidences of various esophageal diseases (e.g., congenital esophageal stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, esophageal cancer) are increasing, but esophageal tissue is difficult to be recovered because of its weak regenerative capability. There are no commercialized off-the-shelf alternatives to current esophageal reconstruction and regeneration methods. Surgeons usually use ectopic conduit tissues including stomach and intestine, presumably inducing donor site morbidity and severe complications. To date, polymer-based esophageal substitutes have been studied as an alternative. However, the fabrication techniques are nearly limited to creating only cylindrical outer shapes with the help of additional apparatus (e.g., mandrels for electrospinning) and are unable to recapitulate multi-layered characteristic or complex-shaped inner architectures. 3D bioprinting is known as a suitable method to fabricate complex free-form tubular structures with desired pore characteristic. In this study, we developed a extrusion-based 3D printing technique to control the size and the shape of the pore in a single extrusion process, so that the fabricated structure has a higher flexibility than that fabricated in the conventional process. Based on this suggested technique, we developed a bioprinted 3D esophageal structure with multi-layered features and converged with biochemical microenvironmental cues of esophageal tissue by using decellularizedbioinks from mucosal and muscular layers of native esophageal tissues. The two types of esophageal tissue derived-decellularized extracellular matrix bioinks can mimic the inherent components and composition of original tissues with layer specificity. This structure can be applied to full-thickness circumferential esophageal defects and esophageal regeneration. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) is a potential regulatory node in the mevalonate pathway that is frequently dysregulated in tumors. This study found that HMGCS1 expression is upregulated in stomach adenocarcinoma samples of patients and tumorspheres of gastric cancer cells. HMGCS1 elevates the expression levels of the pluripotency genes Oct4 and SOX-2 and contributes to tumorsphere formation ability in gastric cancer cells. HMGCS1 also promotes in vitro cell growth and progression and the in vivo tumor growth and lung metastasis of gastric cancer cells. After blocking the mevalonate pathway by statin and dipyridamole, HMGCS1 exerts nonmetabolic functions in enhancing gastric cancer progression. Furthermore, the level and nuclear translocation of HMGCS1 in gastric cancer cells are induced by serum deprivation. HMGCS1 binds to and activates Oct4 and SOX-2 promoters. HMGCS1 also enhances the integrated stress response (ISR) and interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducer protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Our results reveal that HMGCS1 contributes to gastric cancer progression in both metabolic and nonmetabolic manners. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoproliferation encompasses a broad range of clinicopathologic findings, including specific subtypes, for example, EBV mucocutaneous ulcer. Here we reassessed 36 cases of primary EBV diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (16 men and 20 women; median age, 69.5\\u2009y; range, 35 to 84\\u2009y), including 8 immunosuppressed patients (Lugano stage II-IV; median age, 74\\u2009y), 7 nonimmunosuppressed patients with stage I disease (median age, 69\\u2009y), and 21 nonimmunosuppressed patients with stage II-IV disease (median age, 69\\u2009y). All immunosuppressed patients exhibited iatrogenic immunodeficiency and an ulcerative appearance, with ulcer sites including the stomach (1 patient), small intestine (6 patients), and rectum (1 patient). Four patients were in the setting of treated lymphoma-associated immunosuppression. Immunosuppressed patients had higher incidences of intestinal involvement (P=0.001) and perforation (n=2) compared with advanced stage nonimmunosuppressed patients. Among nonimmunosuppressed stage I patients, lesions were restricted to the stomach, none showed multiple lesions or elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and the overall survival curve plateaued, although it was not statistically significant (P=0.0581). One nonimmunosuppressed stage I patient with a polypoid lesion exhibited spontaneous regression within 2 months after diagnosis, while another with bulky disease pursued an aggressive clinical course. Nonimmunosuppressed stage I cases without bulky masses may be considered EBV mucocutaneous ulcer with local progression. Our results demonstrated that primary EBV gastrointestinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma could be delineated into 3 groups based on immune status and clinical stage, revealing distinguishing features useful as a pragmatic guide for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The use of endoscopic techniques to cure small sized, well differentiated early gastric cancer has been adopted worldwide. In the Eastern world, endoscopic resection is being increasingly utilized to treat small undifferentiated early gastric cancer according to the extended criteria proposed by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Associations. However, studies in the Western world reported in these tumors a rate of nodal metastasis ranging between 5% and 20%, that is higher of those observed in Eastern counterparts. A tool to predict the risk of nodal dissemination would be of great use to guide treatment toward endoscopic resection. In our study, we propose E-cadherin expression as a biological factor to predict lymph node involvement. We retrospectively reviewed the E-cadherin (E-cad) expression profile of all histological specimens of undifferentiated early gastric cancer from two Oncologic Departments and compared it with several tumor characteristics. A total of 39 patients with early gastric cancer met the inclusion criteria, of which 16 (41%) pT1a, and 23 (58.9%) pT1b SM1. Thirty-two patients (82%) underwent subtotal gastrectomy, whereas total gastrectomy was performed in only seven cases (17.9%). Patients were divided into two groups: low E-cad expression (E-cad 0/1+, 10 patients) and high E-cad expression (E-cad 2+/3+, 29 patients) according to the immunohistochemical assay (ICH). On univariate analysis, we found an association between low E-cad expression and low grading tumor (p = 0.019), pure undifferentiated histotype (PU-type) (p = 0.014), and lymph node involvement (N+) (p < 0.001). The association between low E-cad expression and lymph node metastasis was confirmed by multivariate analysis (OR = 14.5, 95% CI 3.46-60.76, p < 0.001). The loss of expression of E-cad may be a simple biological factor to predict lymph nodes metastasis in patients with undifferentiated early gastric cancer. Additional larger prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings. After failure of first-line chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidines and platinum compounds for advanced gastric cancer, second-line chemotherapy with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel, which elicits a durable response, and third-line or later chemotherapy with nivolumab have been shown to lead to a more favorable prognosis in advanced gastric cancer patients. As new and more effective drugs are now available, sequential chemotherapy would contribute to prolonged survival. From this point of view, the patient\\'s disease course should be frequently monitored in order to adapt treatment regimens. This review summarizes the points to note in regard to radiological assessment, and discusses the integration of prognostic factors, tumor markers, and clinical symptoms that need to be taken into account to change treatment at an appropriate timing. As cancer patients are surviving longer, more patients manifest brain metastases (BRMs). However, the rate of BRMs from upper gastrointestinal cancer is unclear. We therefore evaluated the frequency and prognostic effect of BRMs in this setting.\\nWe analyzed records of 2348 patients who were treated between January 2002 and December 2016 for upper gastrointestinal cancer, including esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (EAC; proximal EAC, Siewert types I and II), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC; Siewert type III and stomach cancer) in our Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology Database. Frequency, risk factors, and survival after BRMs were evaluated.\\nOf 2348 patients, 68 (2.9%) had BRMs upon follow-up. The BRM rates were as follows: proximal EAC, 4.8%; Siewert type I, 5.9%; Siewert type II, 2.2%; Siewert type III, 0.7%; ESCC: 1.2%; and stomach cancer, 0%. Among EAC patients, Siewert type I and lymph node metastases were independent the\\xa0risk factors for BRMs in the multivariable analysis. The\\xa0median overall survival (OS) in the 68 patients with BRMs was only 1.16\\xa0years (95% CI 0.78-1.61). However, OS for patients who had a solitary BRM, who had BRM but no other distant metastasis, or who underwent surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery favorable.\\nPatients with proximally located adenocarcinoma, or with lymph node metastases are at a higher risk for BRMs and patients fare better after treatment of isolated BRM. The purpose of this research was to calculate and compare standardised incidence and mortality ratios in young adults, based on the data published by the population-based cancer registry of Metropolitan Lima.\\nA secondary analysis was carried out on the data published by the population-based cancer registry of Metropolitan Lima in its last five volumes. Calculating the standardised incidence ratio, in accordance with the World Health Organization\\'s standard population, was done using the direct method, and the annual percentage change was calculated using the Joinpoint Regression Program.\\nFrom 1990 to 2012, 12,380 new cases of cancer in young adults between the ages of 20 and 49 were reported in Metropolitan Lima. The neoplasms with the highest standardised incidence ratio in the young adult male group were testicular cancer, brain and nervous system cancer, stomach cancer, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma and bowel cancer. The neoplasms with the highest standardised mortality ratio for this group were stomach cancer, brain and nervous system cancer, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, tracheal cancer, bronchial and lung cancer and liver cancer. The neoplasms with the highest standardised incidence ratio in the young adult female group were breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and brain and nervous system cancer. The neoplasms with the highest standardised mortality ratio for this group were breast cancer, cervical cancer, stomach cancer, brain and nervous system cancer and non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.\\nYoung adults represent a highly unique group, characterised by little diagnostic suspicion, distribution and aggressiveness of the neoplasms that occur in them. Assessing and reporting incidence and mortality ratios in this age group can contribute to decision making. Head and neck cancers are among the commonest cancers in the developing world. Personal habits, such as the use of tobacco, betel nut and alcohol are strongly associated with the development of head and neck cancers at certain sites. Therefore, they are among the preventable cancers. In Bhutan, there has not yet been a study conducted on head and neck cancers.\\nTo describe baseline epidemiological and histopathological characteristics of head and neck cancers in Bhutan.\\nThis is a 7-year descriptive study of all cases of head and neck cancers presented at the Jigme Dorji Wangchuk National Referral Hospital from 2011 to 2017. The data were collected from the hospital\\'s medical records section, histopathology records, patient referral unit and some treatment centres in India. Prior approval was sought from the Research and Ethics Board for Health, the Ministry of Health and the hospital management.\\nThere were a total of 515 cases of head and neck cancers from 2011 to 2017. The crude incidence rate was 10 per 100,000 and the overall age adjusted rate was 12.3 (95% CI 9.5-15.1) per 100,000 population. The prevalence during this 7-year period was 69.1 per 100,000 population. The commonest cancers are thyroid, oral cavity, hypopharyngeal, laryngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer in decreasing order. Head and neck cancers are more common in males than females in the majority of sites except thyroid, salivary gland and sinonasal malignancies. Thyroid cancers and nasopharyngeal cancers are found to affect younger age groups. Tashigang (48) followed by Paro (43) recorded the highest number of cases. Squamous cell carcinoma is the commonest histopathology type in almost all the cases, while papillary carcinoma is the commonest among thyroid cancers. Personal habits, such as smoking, chewing tobacco, betel nut and alcohol consumption, were found to be more common among patients suffering from oral cavity, laryngeal, hypopharyngeal and oropharyngeal cancers.\\nHead and neck cancers are the third most common cancer in Bhutan after stomach cancer and cervical cancer. Thyroid, oral cavity and hypopharynx are the top three anatomical sites for head and neck cancers in Bhutan. The current epidemiological and histopathological profile of head and neck cancers will form a baseline of information and basis for further research on head and neck cancers in Bhutan. To evaluate and study the dynamics of endothelial dysfunction instrumental indicators, vascular wall stiffness and microcirculation state in patients with gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma) before and after chemotherapy; compare it with the results obtained from healthy volunteers and patients with cardio-vascular diseases.\\nThe study included 65 people: 25 healthy volunteers, 15 patients with known cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) and 25 patients with histologically confirmed gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma) stage 2-4 who underwent surgical treatment followed by chemotherapy according to the FOLFOX, XELOX, and XP regimes. For non-invasive assessment of the vascular wall\\'s state of large vessels and microcirculation, all patients in the main group underwent computer nailfold capillaroscopy and finger photoplethysmography before chemotherapy and within a month after the completion of the last course. For healthy volunteers and patients with CVD, the above studies were performed once during the examination.\\nThe data obtained indicate a significant increase in the reflection index of small muscle arteries (RI) and the stiffness index of large conducting arteries (aSI) during chemotherapy. In cancer patients, even before the treatment, endothelial dysfunction was detected, which significantly worsened after treatment (occlusion index (IO) before and after chemotherapy 1.7 (1.38; 1.9) vs. 1.3 (1.2; 1.5), p&lt;0.0002, respectively). Significant differences in the compared indices in cancer patients and CVD group were revealed only after chemotherapy. Significant structural and functional disorders of capillaries were noted in the studied groups, which also worsened during chemotherapy in the main group (density of the capillary network at rest 43.23cap/mm2 vs. 42.19cap/mm2, p &lt;0.01, respectively; density of the capillary network after the reactive hyperemia test 46.77cap/mm2 vs. 44.11cap/mm2, p&lt;0,02, respectively).\\nIn this study, for the first time, the dynamics of endothelial dysfunction indicators, vascular wall stiffness and microcirculation state in patients with gastric cancer were studied, and a reliable increasing of these changes was proved during chemotherapy. The results indicate the need for a further search for accurate and effective methods of identifying early signs of close and distant vasculotoxicity, the development of individual prevention programs in order to significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events during and after chemotherapy. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGIDs) are defined by marked eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract resulting in a wide variety of GI symptoms. When accompanied by blood hypereosinophilia (HE; absolute eosinophil count ≥1500/mm\\nTo describe the GI disease of patients categorized as those with HES/EGID overlap versus those with Multisystem HES.\\nConsecutively enrolled patients on a natural history protocol to study eosinophilia with biopsy-proven EGID involving the esophagus, stomach, small-bowel, and/or colon were evaluated for clinical, histopathologic, and endoscopic features by retrospective chart review.\\nAmong the 56 patients with EGID and HE, 34 were categorized as HES/EGID overlap and 22 as Multisystem HES. Demographics, GI symptoms, and associated comorbidities were similar between the 2 groups. Multisegment GI eosinophilia was present in 20 of 30 (67%) patients who underwent tissue sampling of all 4 GI segments. Tissue eosinophilia in all 4 GI segments was found in 5 of 30 (17%) patients. Dietary therapy was more common in patients with HES/EGID overlap (65% vs 23%, P\\xa0= .0028). Patients with Multisystem HES were more likely to receive glucocorticoids (100% vs 79%, P\\xa0= .0349) and nonglucocorticoid systemic therapies (77% vs 38%, P\\xa0= .0061). One-third (8 of 22) of patients with Multisystem HES presented with isolated GI symptoms before developing extraintestinal manifestations at a median of 1 year (range, 0.25-15 years).\\nThere are striking clinical similarities between patients with Multisystem HES and those with HES/EGID overlap, despite differing treatment approaches. Moreover, Multisystem HES can present with isolated GI involvement. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these\\xa0findings. Limited studies have compared the association between various physical measurements and the risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aim to explore the best-individualized indicators of cancer and CVD risk assessment.\\nFrom May 2004 to December 2017, a community-based cohort in China involving 100\\xa0280 participants were enrolled. BMI, height, body surface area (BSA), and body fat percentage (BFP) were compared in parallel about cancer and CVD risk with the multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression model.\\nWithin the follow-up period, 3107 (3.10%) were diagnosed with cancer and 3721 (3.71%) had CVD. Per-level increased (in tertile: T1, T2, and T3 level) BSA, height, and BFP was positively associated with the risk of overall cancer [HR (95% CI): 1.10 (1.05-1.15), 1.12 (1.07-1.18), and 1.10 (1.03-1.16), respectively], whereas BMI was insignificant. Compared with the reference group (T2), the highest BSA level (T3) was positively associated with overall cancer incidence for both male [HR (95% CI): 1.28 (1.13-1.45)] and female [HR (95% CI): 1.13 (1.00-1.28)]. The BSA, height, and BFP also significantly associated with some site-specific cancers including thyroid, stomach, breast, urinary system, and skin cancer. Meanwhile, BFP presented a strong positive association with overall CVD [HR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.15-1.30) in trend] in both gender and associated with nearly all CVD subtypes especially the myocardial infarction and heart failure.\\nBSA, height, and BFP have more sensitivity in assessing cancer risk and BFP shows the largest hazard ratios for CVD incident. We provided valuable evidence for the application of height, BSA, and BFP in routine healthcare practice. These encouraging findings should be tested in more well-defined studies for risk prediction. None This study examined the association between chronic HBV or HCV infection and the risk of extrahepatic cancers. A total of 537\\xa0103 adults aged ≥20\\xa0years without history of cancer were identified from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort between 2003 and 2013. The difference in cancer incidence was compared between those with and without chronic HBV or HCV infection. During 3\\xa0854\\xa0130 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up: 8.0\\xa0years), 19\\xa0089 participants developed cancer. After adjusting for sex, body mass index, smoking, drinking, income percentile, residential area and comorbidities, hazard ratios (HRs) for incident extrahepatic cancer were significantly higher in participants with chronic HBV infection (HR: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.35), HCV infection (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.16-1.48) or HBV/HCV dual infection (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.31-1.72) compared to participants without HBV or HCV infection. In chronic HBV infection, the cancer risk was higher for haematologic malignancy [HR (95% CI)\\xa0=\\xa02.46 (1.92-3.15)], gallbladder [1.55 (1.05-2.29)], pancreas [1.52 (1.07-2.15)], stomach [1.39 (1.22-1.58)], lung [1.27 (1.04-1.55)], colorectum [1.21 (1.03-1.42)] and thyroid cancer [1.20 (1.05-1.36)]. In chronic HCV infection, the cancer risk was higher for testis [10.34 (1.35-79.78)], gallbladder [2.90 (1.62-5.18)], prostate [2.51 (1.65-3.82)] and thyroid cancer [1.46 (1.10-1.93)]. In conclusion, chronic HBV or HCV infection was not only associated with an increased risk of liver cancer, but also associated with an increased risk of multiple extrahepatic cancers. Intratumoral heterogeneity has been recognized as a significant barrier in successfully developing targetable biomarkers for gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) and may affect neoadjuvant precision medicine approaches.\\nTo describe intratumoral spatial heterogeneity of tumor cell populations in nonmetastatic GEA and its association with survival.\\nThis case series retrospectively identified 41 patients with GEA who underwent up-front surgical resection at a tertiary referral cancer center from January 1, 1989, through December 31, 2013. Survival was calculated from date of surgery to date of death through June 1, 2017. Data were analyzed from June 2, 2017, to March 1, 2019.\\nOverall survival, intratumoral clonal composition determined by genomic single-nucleotide variation array and bioinformatic analysis, and intercellular tumoral distances determined by multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization.\\nAmong the 41 patients included in the analysis (22 men [54%]; mean [SD] age, 63 [12] years), a high proportion (19 [46%]) presented with tumors possessing high intratumoral heterogeneity. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that cases with an intratumoral clonal composition count of at least 2 exhibited worse survival compared with cases with a clonal composition count of 0 to 1 (univariate hazard ratio,\\u20093.92; 95% CI, 1.27-12.08; P\\u2009=\\u2009.02). This finding remained significant on multivariate analysis controlling for stage, Lauren histologic subtype, receipt of adjuvant therapy, and age (multivariate hazard ratio,\\u20094.55; 95% CI, 1.09-19.04; P\\u2009=\\u2009.04). Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated intratumoral clonal populations coexisting at submillimeter distances with differing relevant oncogenic copy number alterations, such as EGFR, JAK2, FGFR2, MET, CCND1, KRAS, MYC, PIK3CA, CD274, and PDCD1LG2.\\nThis study found that spatial intratumoral heterogeneity of oncogenic copy number alterations exists before metastatic dissemination, and increased heterogeneity was associated with worse outcomes in resected GEA. Baseline heterogeneity illustrates the challenges in GEA targeted therapy. Further study may offer insight into strategies on combinatorial and/or sequential targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a decisive role in the development and progression of cancer. To investigate CSCs in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated carcinoma (EBVaGC), we screened previously reported stem cell markers of gastric cancer in EBV-infected gastric cancer cell lines (TMK1 and NUGC3) and identified CD44v6v9 double positive cells as candidate CSCs. CD44v6/v9 There have been two reports on preserving the proximal gastric tube by using intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG)-based photodynamic detection to evaluate blood flow through the anastomosis for gastric tube cancer after esophagectomy. However, in those cases, the period since the first operation was > 3\\u2009years 11\\u2009months, and there have been no reports of cases with < 1-year periods after the first operation.\\nA 59-year-old man underwent video-assisted thoracic subtotal esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction after two courses of preoperative chemotherapy for middle thoracic esophageal cancer. After half a year, follow-up upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a submucosal tumor in the posterior wall of the pre-pyloric region. We performed a biopsy, and the results led to a diagnosis of gastric cancer (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma: tub2). Clinically, the patient was described as having stage IB (cT2N0M0) gastric cancer of the reconstructed gastric tube. To avoid total gastrectomy, we tried to evaluate the blood flow of the proximal part of the gastric tube by intraoperative ICG-based photodynamic detection. Intraoperative findings confirmed neo-vascularization from the remnant cervical esophagus to the upper region of the gastric tube approximately 7\\u2009cm through the esophagogastric anastomosis. Therefore, we dissected the distal part of the gastric tube approximately 4\\u2009cm from the esophagogastric anastomosis and then performed Roux-en-Y gastro-jejunostomy via the ante-sternum route. The postoperative course was stable, and the patient was discharged on the 14th postoperative day.\\nICG-based photodynamic diagnosis was found to be simple and less invasive. Therefore, even if the postoperative period is short, this method should be considered for evaluation of blood flow prior to performing less invasive surgery. Krukenberg tumours are not uncommon, but pregnancy-complicating Krukenberg tumours are rare. To identify management strategies of pregnancies with Krukenberg tumours, the medical records of patients treated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital over the past 20 years were collected and analysed. Four patients were enrolled. The primary tumour sites were the stomach and colorectal region. Three patients presented with obvious and severe gastrointestinal symptoms at 11-18 weeks of gestation, and their symptoms gradually developed into physiological signs associated with malignancy. Three patients underwent termination of pregnancy via induced delivery and gestational hysterectomy. One patient underwent caesarean section at 31 weeks of gestation. Two patients underwent palliative surgery due to extensive lesions. The other two patients with metastatic lesions confined to the ovaries and liver, underwent satisfactory cytoreductive surgery and anti-tumour treatments postoperatively. Pregnant women who exhibit new gastrointestinal symptoms or aggravation of previous gastrointestinal symptoms after the end of the first trimester should be carefully examined for digestive system diseases. If ovarian metastasis is highly suspected, the pregnancy should be terminated as early as possible. Although the chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia has some explanatory presence in clinical practice, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been clearly distinguished in patients with cancer. Therefore, we aimed with this study to investigate the role of inflammation by examining the inflammatory markers in the physiopathology of adjuvant chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer.\\nTo detect the presence of sarcopenia, patients\\' body composition measurements were assessed using the BIA, and their muscular strength was assessed with a handgrip dynamometer in both pre- and post-adjuvant chemotherapy. At the same time, we examined the baseline and post-adjuvant chemotherapy anthropometric measurements and inflammatory markers in serum (Hs-CRP, IL8, and TNF-α). Patients were divided in three groups. Group 1 consisted of patients who presented post-treatment sarcopenia although they did not have it prior to the treatment, group 2 included the patients who had no pre- or post-treatment sarcopenia, and group 3 was comprised of patients who presented pre-treatment sarcopenia. Each group included 30 patients.\\nA total of 90 patients were included in the study. Fifty-one of them were female patients. Median age was 60.5 (range 27-83). The patients consisted of cases with colorectal and gastric cancers. In group 1, Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a significant difference between scores of IL-8 (pg/mL), TNF-α (pg/mL) and Hs-CRP (mg/dL) given for the post-chemotherapy compared with the pre-chemotherapy ((Z 3.61, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), (Z 3.254, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), (Z 3.319, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001)). The post-chemotherapy median scores of IL-8 (pg/mL), TNF-α (pg/mL), and Hs-CRP were 76.31, 7.34, and 1.55, respectively, which remained on the levels of 12.25, 1.6, and 0.51 for the pre-chemotherapy. For group 2, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated no significant difference between scores of the same markers given for the post-chemotherapy compared with the pre-chemotherapy. In all patients (including groups 1, 2, and 3), a comparison of the patients with pre-treatment sarcopenia (n\\u2009=\\u200930) and non-sarcopenic patients (n\\u2009=\\u200960) in terms of baseline IL-8, TNF-α, and Hs-CRP mean levels, IL-8 and Hs-CRP were found to be statistically different (146.02 (SD 311.96) vs. 47.24 (SD 66.3) (p\\xa0=\\u20090.009), 3.91 (SD 4.26) vs. 0.75 (SD 1.08) (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), respectively).\\nThe present prospective observational study suggested an association of chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia with inflammatory markers Hs-CRP, IL8, and TNF-α. Inflammation may play a role in chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia in newly diagnosed non-metastatic patients. To observe the effect of warming needling therapy on gastrointestinal reaction after hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients of spleen and stomach deficiency syndrome after colon cancer surgery.\\nA total of 120 cases of HIPEC were randomized into observation group and control group, 60 cases in each. The patients of the two groups all received HIPEC. In the observation group, 1 h before HIPEC, warming needling technique was applied to Zusanli (ST36), Sanyinjiao (SP6) and Yinlingquan (SP9) and the even-needing technique of acupuncture was applied to Neiguan (PC6) for 30 min, and then the intravenous injection with Ondansetron was given 30 min before HIPEC. In the control group, The intravenous injection with Ondansetron was given 30 min before HIPEC. In the two groups, the changes in nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, diarrhea, total bilirubin (TB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and KPS score, as well as the average hospitalization length of stay were observed.\\nThe total effective rates in the treatment of nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and diarrhea were 91.67%(55/60), 93.33%(56/60), 80.00%(48/60) and 88.33%(53/60) in the observation group and were 78.33%(47/60), 78.33%(47/60), 63.33%(38/60) and 70.00%(42/60) in the control group respectively, and the total effective rate in the treatment of gastrointestinal reaction of HIPEC in the observation group was obviously higher than that in the control group(\\nThe warming needling technique of acupuncture and moxibustion alleviates the gastrointestinal reaction, improves KPS score and reduces the hospitalization length of stay in HIPEC patients after the surgery of colon cancer and differentiated as the spleen and stomach deficiency in traditional Chinese medicine. The present study was designed to investigate the expression of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in gastric cancer and its clinicopathological relationship. In addition, we also aimed to analyze the relationship between helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and TAMs in gastric cancer.The protein expression of CD16 and CD163 in 90 gastric cancer tissues and 30 margin tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. HP infection was detected in 90 gastric cancer tissues and 30 margin tissues by gram staining and immunohistochemistry.There was no clear correlation between CD16 macrophages and gastric cancer. The density of CD163 macrophages was not correlated with the general condition of tumor patients, but with tumor size, tumor differentiation, lymphatic metastasis, depth of invasion and TNM stage. Additionally, the infection rate of HP in gastric cancer tissues was significantly higher.In summary, TAMs are associated with tumor size, degree of differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage, suggesting their critical role in the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer. Data on historic trends and estimates of future cancer incidence are essential if cancer services are to be adequately resourced in future years.\\nAge-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) for all cancers combined and 19 common cancers diagnosed during 1993-2017 were determined by sex, year of diagnosis, and age. Data were fitted using an age-period-cohort model, which was used to predict rates in future years up to 2040. These were combined with population projections to provide estimates of the future case number.\\nCompared with the annual average in 2013-2017, for all cancers (excluding nonmelanoma skin) ASIRs are expected by 2040 to fall 9% among males and rise 12% among females, while the number of cases diagnosed is projected to increase by 45% for males and 58% for females. Case volume is projected to rise for all cancer types except for cervical and stomach cancer, with the annual number of cases diagnosed projected to more than double among males for melanoma, liver, and kidney cancers, and among females for liver, pancreatic, and lung cancers.\\nIncreased numbers of cancer cases is projected, due primarily to projected increases in the number of people aged 60 years and over.\\nProjected increases will significantly impact the health services which diagnose and treat cancer. However, while population growth is primarily responsible, reduction of exposure to cancer risk factors, especially tobacco use, obesity, alcohol consumption, and UV radiation, could attenuate the predicted increase in cancer cases. Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (GIAC) of the tubular gastrointestinal (GI) tract including esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum comprise most GI cancers and share a spectrum of genomic features. However, the unified epigenomic changes specific to GIAC are poorly characterized. Using 907 GIAC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we applied mathematical algorithms to large-scale DNA methylome and transcriptome profiles to reconstruct transcription factor (TF) networks and identify a list of functionally hyperactive master regulator (MR) TF shared across different GIAC. The top candidate HNF4A exhibited prominent genomic and epigenomic activation in a GIAC-specific manner. A complex interplay between the HNF4A promoter and three distal enhancer elements was coordinated by GIAC-specific MRTF including ELF3, GATA4, GATA6, and KLF5. HNF4A also self-regulated its own promoter and enhancers. Functionally, HNF4A promoted cancer proliferation and survival by transcriptional activation of many downstream targets, including HNF1A and factors of interleukin signaling, in a lineage-specific manner. Overall, our study provides new insights into the GIAC-specific gene regulatory networks and identifies potential therapeutic strategies against these common cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that GIAC-specific master regulatory transcription factors control HNF4A via three distal enhancers to promote GIAC cell proliferation and survival. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/80/13/2722/F1.large.jpg. This meta-analysis aims to clarify the effect of IL-17 polymorphisms on the susceptibility to GCa in the Chinese population.\\nRelevant pieces of literature were searched in PubMed, Web of School, VIP, and CNKI using the key words as \"IL-17, gastric/stomach cancer\" or \"IL-17 polymorphisms, gastric/stomach cancer susceptibility\". The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in the selected studies were calculated using RevMan5.3 and STATA12.0.\\nA total of 12 investigations reporting mutations in IL-17A rs2275913 and IL-17F rs763780 were enrolled. There were 11 studies reporting rs2275913 G>A, involving 3299 cases of GCa patients and 3339 cases of healthy controls. The random-effects model was performed since the heterogeneity test results of the recessive genetic model (GG&GA vs. AA) and the allelic model (G vs. A) of IL-17A rs2275913 G>A were I2>66%/p=0.001. Meanwhile, the dominant genetic model (GG vs. GA&AA) and the super-dominant genetic model (GA vs. GG&AA) of IL-17A rs2275913 G>A were I2< 50%/p>0.05, and the fixed-effects model was used. The meta-analysis showed that IL-17A rs2275913 G>A was positively correlated with GCa susceptibility under four genetic models (p<0.05). Five studies reporting IL-17F rs763780 T>C were enrolled, including 2535 cases of GCa patients and 2402 cases of healthy controls. The heterogeneity test showed that, except for the super-dominant genetic model, the p-value was <0.00001 in the dominant, recessive, and allelic models, and their I2 values were 87%, 88%, and 93%, respectively. Hence, a random-effects model was selected. IL-17F rs763780 T>C was positively correlated with GCa susceptibility under the super-dominant genetic model (p=0.003), rather than the other three models (p>0.05).\\nIL-17A rs2275913 G>A polymorphism contributes to susceptibility to GCa in the dominant, recessive, allelic, and super-dominant models. Meanwhile, IL-17F rs763780 T>C polymorphism is positively correlated with GCa susceptibility in the super-dominant model. Autophagy is a process of active programmed cell death, where a dying cell induces autophagosomes and subsequently regulated by degradative machinery. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism behind induction of autophagic cell death by Naringin flavonoid in AGS cancer cells. Growth inhibition of AGS cells showed downregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by Naringin treatment. Transmission electron microscopy observation showed swollen mitochondria and lysosome near peri-nuclear zone fused with autophagic vacuoles. Rapamycin pre-treatment with Naringin showed significant decrease in mTOR phosphorylation and increase in LC3B activation in AGS cells. Decrease in mTOR phosphorylation is associated with lysosomal function activation was observed by time-dependent treatment of Naringin. Induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) was observed by LAMP1 activation leading lysosomal cell death by releasing Cathepsin D from lysosomal lumen to cytosol. Naringin treated AGS cells showed up-regulating BH3 domain Bad, down-regulating Bcl-xL, and Bad phosphorylation and significant mitochondrial fluorescence intensity expression. Significant localization of mitochondria and LC3B activation was examined by person coefficient correlation. Activation of ERK1/2-p38 MAPKs and production of intracellular ROS has been observed over Naringin treatment. It has also been elucidated that pre-treatment with NAC inhibited mitochondria-LC3B colocalization, where ROS acted as upstream of ERK1/2-p38 MAPKs activation. Lysosomal cell death involvement has been evaluated by BAF A1 pre-treatment, inhibiting LAMP1, Cathepsin D, ROS, and blocking autophagolysosome in AGS cell death. Taken together, these findings show that, Naringin induced autophagy cell death involves LMP mediated lysosomal damage and BH3 protein Bad activation in AGS cancer cells. Tepotinib (MSC2156119J) is an oral, potent and highly selective small molecule mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) inhibitor for which the recommended Phase II dose of 500\\xa0mg once daily has been defined, based on the first-in-man trial conducted in the USA and Europe. We carried out a multicenter Phase I trial with a classic `3 + 3\\' design to determine the recommended Phase II dose in Japanese patients with solid tumors (NCT01832506).\\nPatients aged ≥20\\xa0years with advanced solid tumors (refractory to standard therapy or for whom no effective standard therapy was available) received tepotinib at 215, 300 or 500\\xa0mg once daily in a 21-day\\xa0cycle. Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities during cycle 1 was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics were also evaluated to support the dose assessment.\\nTwelve patients were treated. Tepotinib was generally well tolerated with no observed dose-limiting toxicities; treatment-related adverse events were mainly grades 1-2. The tolerability profile of tepotinib was similar to that observed in non-Japanese populations. Pharmacokinetics in Japanese and Western patients was comparable. One patient with gastric cancer and one patient with urachal cancer had stable disease of ≥12\\xa0weeks in duration. The observed safety profile and pharmacokinetics are comparable with those in patients from the USA and Europe, and the recommended Phase II dose of tepotinib in Japanese patients was confirmed as 500\\xa0mg once daily.\\nThese results, including initial signals of antitumor activity, support further development of tepotinib in Japanese patients with cancer. Background The benefit of adjuvant treatment in gastric adenocarcinoma patients with\\xa0involvement of the muscularis propria but not beyond is unclear. We aim to establish a model that identifies the factors that adversely affect the prognosis in these patients. Methods We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\\xa0(SEER) database to identify subjects with stage T2aN0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma who had tumor resection between 2004 and 2015. Data pertaining to the following variables were collected: age, gender, ethnicity, tumor size, grade, site, number of lymph nodes (LNs) being examined, and extent of surgery. Results A total of 1307\\xa0patients met our inclusion criteria. The five-year overall survival (OS) was 65%. The following factors were significantly associated with a shorter OS in univariate analysis. Age > 60 years, non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, patients with less than 15 lymph nodes examined at the time of surgery, tumors at the fundus and cardia of the stomach, and those who underwent endoscopic resection or had partial esophagectomy. On multivariate Cox regression, the following factors were predictors for worse OS: age > 60 years with a hazards ratio\\xa0(HR) = 2.03 (95% CI: 1.49-2.76), patients with less than 15 lymph nodes examined with\\xa0HR = 1.72 (95% CI: 1.34-2.20), non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks with\\xa0HR = 1.62 (95% CI: 1.26-2.08), and tumors within the cardia and fundus of the stomach with HR = 1.51 (95% CI: 1.21-1.89). Conclusion Patients with stage T2aN0M0 gastric cancer who had their tumor located at the cardia or fundus of the stomach or those with inadequate lymph nodes resection had inferior survival and could potentially benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the world. By the time the patients are diagnosed with stage IV gastric cancer, many patients already have distant metastases. There is no unified systemic treatment plan in existence. The use of gastrectomy is ambiguous in patients with stage IV gastric cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the beneficial outcome of gastrectomy in patients with stage IV gastric cancer.\\nClinical information of patients with gastric cancer from 2000 to 2010 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were extracted and analysed. The risk factors for stage IV gastric cancer were also analysed.\\nWe observed that the median survival time for patients after surgery was greater than that for patients not treated surgically. The five-year survival rate for chemotherapy patients was higher than that of non-chemotherapeutic patients. Patients who receive both chemotherapy and surgery could achieve a more significant survival benefit. The risks following gastrectomy (partial, subtotal, hemi-) were lower than those of other surgical procedures, which provided guidance on the choice of surgical method. The numbers of regional lymph node metastasis were found to be related to prognosis.\\nIn patients with stage IV gastric cancer, gastrectomy (partial, subtotal or hemi) should be selected when surgery is necessary. The number of regional lymph node metastasis could be considered as a prognostic factor for patients with stage IV gastric cancer and lymph node dissection could reduce the risk of patients undergoing surgery. Nowadays, microplastics (MPs) exist widely in the marine. The surface has strong adsorption capacity for antibiotics in natural environments, and the cytotoxicity of complex are poorly understood. In the study, 500 nm polystyrene (PS-MPs) and 60 nm nanoplastics (PS-NPs) were synthesized. The adsorption of PS to tetracycline (TC) was studied and their toxicity to gastric cancer cells (AGS) was researched. The adsorption experimental results show that PS absorbing capacity increased with increasing TC concentrations. The defense mechanism results show that 60 nm PS-NPs, 500 nm PS-MPs and their complex induce different damage to AGS cells. Furthermore, 600 mg/L PS-NPs and PS-MPs decline cell viability, induce oxidation stress and cause apoptosis. There is more serious damage of 60 nm PS-NPs than 500 nm PS-MPs in cell viability and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). DNA are also damaged by 60 nm PS-NPs and PS-TC NPs, 500 nm PS-MPs and PS-TC MPs, and 60 nm PS-NPs damage DNA more serious than 500 nm PS-MPs. Moreover, 60 nm PS-NPs and PS-TC NPs seem to promote bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) overexpression. All treatments provided us with evidence on how PS-NPs, PS-MPs and their compounds damaged AGS cells. Studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which Barrett\\'s esophagus (BE) progresses to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Notch signaling maintains stem cells in the gastrointestinal tract and is dysregulated during carcinogenesis. We explored the relationship between Notch signaling and goblet cell maturation, a feature of BE, during EAC pathogenesis.\\nWe measured goblet cell density and levels of Notch messenger RNAs in BE tissues from 164 patients, with and without dysplasia or EAC, enrolled in a multicenter study. We analyzed the effects of conditional expression of an activated form of NOTCH2 (pL2.Lgr5.N2IC), conditional deletion of NOTCH2 (pL2.Lgr5.N2fl/fl), or loss of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (pL2.Lgr5.p65fl/fl), in Lgr5\\nProgression of BE to EAC was associated with a significant reduction in goblet cell density comparing nondysplastic regions of tissues from patients; there was an inverse correlation between goblet cell density and levels of NOTCH3 and JAG2 messenger RNA. In mice, expression of the activated intracellular form of NOTCH2 in Lgr5\\nNotch signaling contributes to activation of NF-κB and regulates differentiation of gastric cardia progenitor cells in a mouse model of BE. In human esophageal tissues, progression of BE to EAC was associated with reduced goblet cell density and increased levels of Notch expression. Strategies to block this pathway might be developed to prevent EAC in patients with BE. Gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction cancers (GCs) frequently recur after resection but markers to predict recurrence risk are missing. T-cell infiltrates have been validated as prognostic markers in other cancer types, but not in GC due to methodological limitations of past studies. We aimed to define and validate the prognostic role of major T-cell subtypes in GC by objective computational quantification.\\nSurgically resected chemotherapy-naïve GCs were split into discovery (n\\u2009=\\u2009327) and validation (n\\u2009=\\u2009147) cohorts. CD8 (cytotoxic), CD45RO (memory) and FOXP3 (regulatory) T-cell densities were measured through multicolour immunofluorescence and computational image analysis. Cancer specific survival (CSS) was assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided.\\nCD45RO-cell and FOXP3-cell densities statistically significantly predicted CSS in both cohorts. Stage, CD45RO-cell and FOXP3-cell densities were independent predictors of CSS in multivariable analysis; mismatch repair (MMR) and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) status were not statistically significant. Combining CD45RO-cell and FOXP3-cell densities into the Stomach Cancer Immune Score showed highly statistically significant (all p\\u2009≤\\u20090.002) CSS differences (0.9y median CSS to not reached). T-cell infiltrates were highest in EBV-positive GCs and similar in MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient GCs.\\nThe validation of CD45RO-cell and FOXP3-cell densities as prognostic markers in GC may guide personalized follow-up or (neo)adjuvant treatment strategies. Only those 20% of GCs with the highest T-cell infiltrates showed particularly good CSS, suggesting that a small subgroup of GCs is highly immunogenic. The potential for T-cell densities to predict immunotherapy responses should be assessed. The association of high FOXP3-cell densities with longer CSS warrants studies into the biology of regulatory T-cells in GC. None Familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX) is a phenotypically defined subset of hereditary colorectal cancer with unknown and potentially heterogeneous genetic aetiology. FCCTX has been characterized as a colorectal cancer-specific syndrome, which we herein challenge by estimating the risk for extra-colorectal cancer in the Danish FCCTX cohort.\\nThrough the national hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) register, 213 families fulfilling the Amsterdam I criteria and showing retained mismatch repair (MMR) function were identified. In here, sex and age-specific incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for 30 extra-colorectal cancer types in comparison with the general Danish population.\\nIn total, 494 extra-colorectal cancers developed with significantly increased risks for cancers of the urinary tract, breast, stomach, pancreas, and eye tumours. The age groups at increased risks were 30-49\\u2009years for gastric cancer, 30-69\\u2009years for female breast cancer, 50-69\\u2009years for ocular melanoma and above age 70 for pancreatic cancer and urothelial cancer.\\nDanish FCCTX families show an increased risk of several extra-colorectal cancer types. This observation may indicate unidentified disease-predisposing genetic variants in this phenotypically defined subset of hereditary colorectal cancer and calls for awareness during genetic counselling and follow-up. The prevalence of gastric cancer after eradication (GCAE) is increasing dramatically in Japan. GCAE has characteristic features, and we must understand these features in endoscopic examinations. Differentiated cancer types were frequently found after eradication and included characteristic endoscopic features such as reddish depression (RD). However, benign RD can be difficult to distinguish from gastric cancer because of histological alterations in the surface structures (nonneoplastic epithelium or epithelium with low-grade atypia [ELA]) as well as multiple appearances of RD. Recently, we clarified similar alterations in genetic mutations between ELA and gastric cancer, suggesting that ELA is derived from gastric cancer. Clinically, submucosal invasive cancer was frequently found in patients after eradication therapy even if they received annual endoscopic surveillance. We can improve the diagnostic ability using image-enhanced endoscopy with magnified observation. None None The development of chemotherapy resistance significantly impairs the efficiency of chemotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer (GC) are complicated and still need to be further explored. Here, we aimed to reveal the effects of miR-4290/PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) axis on chemotherapy resistance of GC in vitro. The expression patterns of miR-4290 in GC tissues and cell lines were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Kaplan-Meier was used to assess the relationship between miR-4290 expression levels and patients\\' overall survival. CCK-8 and flow cytometry technologies were applied to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis. The luciferase gene reporter assay was used to evaluate the interaction between miR-4290 and PDK1. miR-4290 was lowly expressed in GC tissues and cell lines, which was closely associated with the shorter overall survival of GC patients. miR-4290 mimics significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, as well as induced a significant reduction in the expression of PDK1. Moreover, miR-4290 significantly inhibited glycolysis and decreased the IC50 value to cisplatin in SGC7901 cells, whereas these effects were abolished and cell apoptosis was promoted when PDK1 was overexpressed. In conclusion, this study revealed that miR-4290 suppressed PDK1-mediated glycolysis to enhance the sensitivity of GC cells to cisplatin. Ramucirumab monotherapy as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) prolongs survival compared to the best supportive care. However, in clinical practice, ramucirumab monotherapy is sometimes used as third- or later-line treatment for AGC refractory to fluoropyrimidine and taxanes. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of salvage-line ramucirumab monotherapy for treating AGC.\\nThe subjects of this retrospective study were advanced gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients who received ramucirumab monotherapy after failure of 2 or more prior regimens containing fluoropyrimidine and taxanes but not ramucirumab.\\nFrom June 2015 to April 2017, 51 patients were enrolled. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]\\u2009=\\u20091.6-2.2) and 5.1 (95% CI\\u2009=\\u20094.0-6.8) months, respectively. The objective response and disease control rates were 2 and 17%, respectively. Grade 3 adverse events (AEs; e.g., anemia, fatigue, hypertension, proteinuria, intestinal bleeding) occurred in seven (13%) patients, but no grade 4 AEs and treatment-related deaths were observed. A neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of <\\u20092.5 and previous gastrectomy were associated with better PFS.\\nSalvage-line ramucirumab monotherapy has acceptable toxicity and comparable efficacy to second-line treatment; therefore, we consider physicians might choose this therapy as a salvage-line treatment option for AGC refractory to the standard therapies. Problem drinking increases the incidence of all-cause mortality and specific cancers, and persistent drinking is associated with cardiovascular disease in certain cancer survivors. This study analyzed the cardiovascular risk factors before and after diagnosis in Korean cancer survivors.\\nData for the period between 2002 and 2013 were collected from the National Health Insurance Service Health-Examinee Cohort Database. Among the 27,835 patients included, those with moderate alcohol consumption before and after cancer diagnosis were excluded. Problem drinking was defined as males under 65 years consuming over 14 glasses a week, and males over 65 years or females consuming over seven glasses a week. A t-test, chi-square test, and linear regression analysis were performed for differences in cardiovascular risk factors and differences according to cancer types.\\nThere was a difference in the body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol among patients who became moderate drinkers after diagnosis, but fasting blood glucose did not show any significant changes. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were analyzed in patients with liver, stomach, rectal, and breast cancer with improved drinking behavior, and there were significant differences in body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and total cholesterol in stomach cancer patients.\\nModerate drinking can lower cardiovascular risk in cancer survivors, and among the many drinking-related cancers, stomach cancer patients demonstrated significantly reduced cardiovascular risk factors. To identify useful markers for prognostic and therapeutic purposes, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provided a molecular classification of gastric cancers (GCs). Previous studies have used immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) to define immunophenotypic surrogate markers of the molecular alterations. Some critical issues concerning the correct definition of immunophenotypic groups have emerged in these studies that employed tissue microarrays (TMAs). We performed an immunophenotypic classification by evaluating MLH1, p53, HER2, E-cadherin, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) on the whole section of the surgical GC samples compared to most of the studies conducted on TMAs. We also investigated the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1, a known therapeutic target. We identified the following immunophenotypic groups: EBV (2.9%); mismatch repair deficient (MMR-D) (7.2%); overexpressed p53 and/or HER2+ (61.4%); aberrant E-cadherin (11.4%); and normal pattern (17.1%). The use of surgical samples emphasized that some immunohistochemical markers were not useful for properly classifying the GC specimens. We can state that EBV (significantly correlated to PD-L1 expression) and MMR-D GCs are well-defined groups, mutually exclusive, and easily assessable with IHC and CISH, and could be candidates for immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. As regards p53, our findings suggest that IHC assessment may be responsible for a misclassification of GC groups. Immunohistochemical evaluation of E-cadherin needs to be standardized, particularly in terms of the heterogeneous cytoplasmic/membranous staining pattern. Whether to consider the normal-pattern group as a separate category remains to be clarified. Because GC specimens with known therapeutic targets account for only 40%, we suggest reviewing the immunophenotypic classification to find new therapeutic targets, such as PD-L1, MLH1, and HER2. Infection by  Globally, fine particulate matter has been associated with several health problems including cancer. However, most studies focused mainly on lung cancer. Stomach and colorectal cancers play significant roles in increasing public health\\'s cancer globally. This study focused on investigating a possible significant association between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about stomach (gastric) cancer prevention. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians who care for cancer patients. It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions. This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The spermatic cord and testis are very rare sites for metastasis from gastric cancer. Although several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this unusual metastasis, the actual mechanism remains unclear. We report a case of right spermatic cord and testicular metastasis, review its imaging findings, and suggest a mechanism of tumor spread.\\nA 61-year-old man complained of a palpable mass in the right inguinal area. He had been treated with distal gastrectomy with chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer 5\\u2009years ago. Computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass surrounding the right spermatic cord, involving the right testis. Another mass was observed in the aortocaval space, presumed to be a metastatic lymph node. The imaging features of the right testicular lesion were different than those of the primary testicular cancer. The lesions at both sites showed similar radiologic features of abundant internal necrosis, which is consistent with metastatic lesions. Pathology confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma. He underwent a series of chemotherapy sessions, and all metastatic masses had partially decreased in size at the 5-month outpatient follow-up.\\nThe imaging features of testicular mass and spermatic cord involvement are important clues for accurate differential diagnosis of metastasis from other primary tumors in patients with a history of stomach cancer. This unusual metastasis can be explained via retrograde tumor spread along the lymphatic channels in terms of concurrent aortocaval lymph node metastasis. A suspicion of metastasis should not be overlooked, even if a patient has undergone curative treatment, including surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, many years ago. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is one of the most common malignant mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. They generally arise from the fourth layer (muscularis propria) and rarely from the second or third layer. Although the manifestations of gastric stromal tumors are diverse, to our knowledge, there are only several cases of an extra-gastric stromal tumor in the literature appearing with a pedunculation. Pedunculated large GISTs are not frequent and compress the neighboring organs. When they were huge, it is difficult to differentiate the origin of the masses. Thus, in the clinical setting, physicians should pay more attention to the pattern of manifestation of the gastric stromal tumor.\\nA 62-year-old man had no gastrointestinal symptoms or significant medical and family histories. During the health examination with US, a cystic-solid tumor was found below liver. The results of the physical examination were unremarkable, and routine laboratory data on admission did not show any abnormal findings.\\nComputed tomography of the abdomen showed a mixed echoic mass measuring 10\\u200a×\\u200a8\\u200a×\\u200a8\\u200acm and located below the liver, adjacent to the gastric antrum. After endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, cytopathology showed that the specimen was filled with red blood cells, and it had no malignant cells. Histopathology revealed that the mass was a GIST, and immunohistochemical analysis showed the following: CD117(+), CD34(+), desmin(-), Dog-1(+), Ki-67% <1%, and smooth muscle actin(-).\\nSurgical resection was performed on the patient.\\nThe lesion was diagnosed as a gastric stromal tumor with a pedicle and an old hemorrhage. The patient\\'s recovery was uneventful. After surgery, computed tomography at the 6-month and 1-year postoperative follow-up visits did not reveal relapse or any metastasis.\\nIn the clinical setting, physicians should pay more attention to the pattern of manifestation of the extra-gastric stromal tumor in patients with a pedicle or hemorrhage. Additionally, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration can be used to make an accurate preoperative diagnosis of such diseases, and its findings can serve as an important basis for surgical excision of the lesions. As a biomarker, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) has been widely recognized in the diagnosis of benign diseases and malignant tumors. This study aimed to investigate the potential diagnostic value of NSE in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.Serum levels of the NSE were compared between 219 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and 298 healthy individuals, NSE and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. Meanwhile, to evaluate the diagnostic capability of NSE, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area under curve (AUC) was calculated.In the present study, the median serum NSE level of the patient group was 20.770\\u200ang/mL, which was higher than that of the control group 15.625\\u200ang/mL (P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). Serum NSE level in patients group compared with healthy control was statistically significant (P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). Serum NSE level was associated with pathological tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Besides, the AUC of NSE in gastric adenocarcinoma was 0.742, which was higher than those of the other 3 markers (0.573-0.644). Besides, the AUC of the combined 4 markers was higher than any individual marker (0.778).Serum NSE detecting may have good value for diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. Besides, the combination of NSE, CEA, CA19-9, and CA242 performed even better than any single marker. Thus, the combined detection of the 4 tumor markers may be more useful for the diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. The methylation status of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) promoter has been shown to be associated with the occurrence of gastric cancer, but this finding remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between methylation of the APC gene promoter and gastric cancer.\\nWe searched the Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases from the date of creation until August 1, 2019. According to the inclusion criteria, the relationship between the methylation status of the APC gene promoter and gastric cancer was investigated. The incidence of APC promoter methylation in the tissues or blood of patients with and without gastric cancer was compared. The results are expressed as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The pooled OR of each study was estimated using a fixed effects model or a random effects model to generate forest plots. We further validated the results using the MethHC database.\\nEight studies (985 samples) were included. Our meta-analysis showed that the incidence of APC promoter methylation in patients with gastric cancer was higher than that of patients without gastric cancer (OR\\u200a=\\u200a3.86, 95% CI 1.71-8.74, P\\u200a=\\u200a.001). Methylation of the APC promoter is associated with the incidence of gastric cancer, and it increases the risk of gastric cancer.\\nThis study provides a new strategic direction for research on gastric cancer. Methylation of the APC promoter may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of gastric cancer, but the results of this work require further confirmation. This study investigated the diagnostic value of preoperative serum neuro-specific enolase (NSE) in gastric cancer (GC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), and the diagnostic viability of combined serum NSE, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA)19-9, and CA242.Patients with GC and CRC, and a healthy control group (n\\u200a=\\u200a666 and 266, respectively) were compared with regard to NSE, CEA, CA19-9, and CA242 serum levels. NSE was analyzed for associations with clinicopathological parameters. To estimate the diagnostic potential of NSE, a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed and the area under the curve (AUCs) was calculated for different patient subgroups.The median serum NSE level of the tumor group (20.925\\u200ang/mL) was significantly higher than that of the control (15.190\\u200ang/mL). Serum NSE was associated with pathological tumor-node-metastasis staging, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, vascular invasion, and nerve infiltration. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for NSE in GC and CRC (0.769) was higher than for the other 3 markers (0.571-0.680). The AUC of the combined markers was higher than for any of the markers individually (0.778-0.810).The AUC for NSE alone suggests it may be an independent tumor marker, and useful for diagnosis of GC and CRC. However, the AUC for combined NSE, CEA, CA19-9, and CA242 was higher and thus potentially more diagnostic value. For a long time, postoperative nutritional support for laryngeal cancer patients has depended on the gastric tube for enteral nutrition. Silica gel gastric tube is often used in clinical practice; however, the gastric tube placed in the conventional depth often leads to various complications in the stomach, thus damaging the nutritional status of patients and leading to the poor prognosis.\\nA total of 80 patients with laryngeal cancer in otolaryngology, head and neck surgery department of Deyang people\\'s hospital from May 2020 to April 2022 will be selected and randomly divided into control group and experimental group according to the numerical table. Patients in the control group will receive conventional gastric tube placement, with a depth of 45 to 55\\u200acm, which can extract gastric juice. B-ultrasound accurately positioned the gastric tube in the stomach instead of the cardia, and postoperative nasal feeding nutrition will be provided. In the experimental group, the gastric tube will be pulled out 10\\u200acm after conventional placement and no gastric juice will be extracted. B-ultrasonography verified that the gastric tube will be located below the esophagus or above the cardia, and routine nasal feeding will be performed postoperatively. Analysis for comfort and prognosis were performed by general comfort questionnaire and various index including height, body mass index, albumin value, electrolyte, wound healing, pharyngeal fistula.\\nIn this study, visual simulation scale and general comfort questionnaire developed by Kolaba, an American comfort nursing specialist, were used to evaluate the comfort level of the 2 groups of patients, including pain, acid reflux, upper abdominal burning sensation, and hiccup. Objective indexes such as height, body mass index, albumin value, electrolyte, wound healing, and pharyngeal fistula were used to evaluate the prognosis of the 2 groups of patients. The visual simulation scale can preliminarily judge the subjective feelings of patients.\\nIt has been registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn/listbycreater.aspx (Identifier: ChiCTR2000030378), Registered February 29, 2020. Gastric cancer (GC) is a common high-mortality disease, causing a serious social burden. Traditional Chinese medicine has been utilized to prevent and treat GC for many years but its effects remain unclear. The aim of our study is to elucidate the anti-tumor effects and the possible mechanism of Jianpi Yangzheng Xiaozheng decoction.\\nThis is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial continuing 1.5 years. Two hundred ten eligible patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups, the chemotherapy alone and the chemotherapy combined with JPYZXZ group at a ratio of 1:2. All patients will receive the treatment for 24 weeks and follow up for 1.5 years. The primary outcomes are one-year survival rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS), while the secondary outcomes are immune related hematology test, objective response rate, tumor makers, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome points, fatigue scale, and quality of life scale. All of these outcomes will be analyzed at the end of the trail.\\nThis study will provide the objective evidence for the efficacy and safety of Jianpi Yangzheng Xiaozheng decoction in advanced GC. Furthermore, it will be helpful to form a therapeutic regimen in advanced GC by the combination of traditional medicine and western medicine.Trail registration: ChiCTR1900028147. The observational study HerMES collected primary data on effectiveness and safety of trastuzumab in patients with human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancer of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) in routine clinical practice, exploring the treatment with trastuzumab, chemotherapy backbones used, and the HER2 testing in a real-world setting in Germany.\\nThis noninterventional study observed patients with histologically confirmed, HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GEJ, who were treated with trastuzumab according to the physicians\\' judgement and clinical practice. The observation phase per patient took as long as the duration of the trastuzumab therapy, but for a maximum of 12 months. A subsequent extended follow-up phase lasted until the patient\\'s death or the end of the study, that is, 2\\u2009years from start of the follow-up phase of the last patient. All data were analyzed descriptively.\\nBetween February 2010 and July 2016, 364 patients were observed at 171 sites throughout Germany. The median overall survival was 14.1 months and the median progression-free survival was 7.9 months. The overall response rate was 43%. Safety was in line with previous reports. This study observed a high diversity of chemotherapy regimens that were combined with trastuzumab. Post hoc subgroup analyses showed differences in outcomes according to the chemotherapy regimen used.\\nTrastuzumab treatment in everyday practice as observed in HerMES confirmed the positive results of the pivotal study ToGA in an observational, real-world setting.\\nReal-world data of trastuzumab treatment of patients with gastroesophageal or gastric metastatic adenocarcinoma confirmed the positive results of the pivotal clinical trial. The observed median overall survival was 14.1 months and the median progression-free survival was 7.9 months. Although recommendations concerning administration of trastuzumab were well implemented, a high diversity of chemotherapy regimens were combined with trastuzumab. Regimens other than the in-label regimens, especially oxaliplatin-based doublets or 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, taxane triplets, were used in 29% of patients. Observation of a second, marginal HER2-positivity population confirmed the benefit of trastuzumab predominantly for well-confirmed human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors and the requirement of reliable HER2 testing. Incidence of chronic subdural hematoma (CSH) associated with metastases of extraneural malignancies is rare. We report a rare case of CSH wherein most of the CSH cavity was occupied with metastatic cancer cells; in addition, we review the literature.\\nA 68-year-old man with a history of gastric cancer presented to our hospital with dysarthria and shoulder paralysis; CSH was diagnosed from preoperative imaging findings. When the hematoma was removed via a small craniotomy, besides the hematoma, we observed an abnormal mass of tissue in the capsule. Pathologically, the mass was consistent with the findings of metastatic gastric cancer. Although the symptoms immediately disappeared postoperatively, a symptomatic acute subdural hematoma with midline shift was observed on postoperative day 27. Emergency craniotomy and hematoma and tumor removal were performed. Pathologic examination showed hemorrhagic necrosis in the tumor, which had not been initially observed. The postoperative course progressed without hematoma recurrence.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a CSH accompanied by tumor metastasis in most of the CSH cavity. Although rare, if a patient with cancer has CSH, the CSH should be treated considering the possibility of metastasis. None The hybrid esophagectomy is a procedure that combines an initial laparoscopic approach in which the gastric conduit is prepared preserving the right gastroepiploic artery, followed by a right thoracotomy for resection of the esophagus, gastric pull-up into the chest, and esophagogastric anastomosis. Critical surgical steps should be carefully respected to perform a safe operation. ntroduction: A proper level of nutrition is significant in the period of convalescence in patients subject to major surgical procedures, particularly due to neoplastic disease. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, or BIA is a widely used method in assessing body mass composition. BIA measurement is easy, quick, cheap and repetitive.\\nWe assessed the body composition of 56 patients (25 women and 31 men) hospitalized and operated at the Department of General and Oncological Surgery of the Wroclaw Medical University in the years 2017-2018 using bioelectric impedance.\\nThe average body weight loss in the 4th postoperative day was 1.32% of body mass and on the day of release from hospital - 4.23% of body mass in relation to body mass upon admission. The percentage of body fat (FM - Fat Mass) in patients admitted to the department is above the normal range. The change in body composition in hospitalized patients mainly concerns the amount of adipose tissue and the amount of extracellular and intracellular water (ECW - Extracellular Water; ICW - Intracellular Water).\\nBioelectrical impedance can be an easy and effective method of assessing body composition and its change in patients undergoing major surgery. Amongst the analyzed groups, patients operated for pancreatic cancer lose the largest percentage of body weight until discharge from the department. Loss of body mass mainly occurs as loss of fat mass (FM). None Gastric endoscopy is a common clinical practice that enables medical doctors to diagnose various lesions inside a stomach. In order to identify the location of a gastric lesion such as early cancer and a peptic ulcer within the stomach, this work addresses to reconstruct the color-textured 3D model of a whole stomach from a standard monocular endoscope video and localize any selected video frame to the 3D model. We examine how to enable structure-from-motion (SfM) to reconstruct the whole shape of a stomach from endoscope images, which is a challenging task due to the texture-less nature of the stomach surface. We specifically investigate the combined effect of chromo-endoscopy and color channel selection on SfM to increase the number of feature points. We also design a plane fitting-based algorithm for 3D point outliers removal to improve the 3D model quality. We show that whole stomach 3D reconstruction can be achieved (more than 90% of the frames can be reconstructed) by using red channel images captured under chromo-endoscopy by spreading indigo carmine (IC) dye on the stomach surface. In experimental results, we demonstrate the reconstructed 3D models for seven subjects and the application of lesion localization and reconstruction. The methodology and results presented in this paper could offer some valuable reference to other researchers and also could be an excellent tool for gastric surgeons in various computer-aided diagnosis applications. The aril (mace) of  Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a rare entity most commonly diagnosed postmortem with rates in autopsy series ranging from 0.9 to 1.6%. A 63-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension and mitral valve prolapse presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, headache, and necrotic skin lesions on her hands and feet. Computed tomography (CT) scan of her chest demonstrated a pulmonary embolus in the right lower lung segmental artery and right upper lobe lobar to segmental pulmonary artery, a mass-like consolidation in the left upper lung field impeding the hilum. CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated metastatic disease in liver and bone and bilateral femoral deep vein thrombosis. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe mitral regurgitation with two small mobile plaques on the mitral valve and two immobile plaques on the descending aorta. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was consistent with subacute infarcts and metastatic disease. Bronchoscopy was performed and pathology revealed primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. She was treated with anticoagulation and systemic chemotherapy. The patient and family elected to proceed with hospice due to her clinical decline, poor performance status, and poor prognosis after a prolonged hospital stay. Underlying malignancy is detected in approximately 40-85% of patients with NBTE. Lung cancer is the most frequently associated malignancy followed by pancreatic, stomach, breast, and ovarian cancer. Widespread necrotic skin lesions as presenting symptoms of primary lung adenocarcinoma are rare. In the present case, the diagnosis of necrotic skin lesions and NBTE preceded that of the neoplastic disease. Necrotic skin lesions and NBTE can be the first manifestations of an occult malignancy causing extensive multi-organ infarcts. NBTE can present with such extensive skin lesions as a first presenting sign of malignancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to present with such extensive skin lesions as the first presenting symptom of lung adenocarcinoma. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious, yet preventable, complication in cancer. Some patients are diagnosed with a second cancer; however, little is known about the epidemiology of VTE in this population.\\nFrom Danish national healthcare registries, we studied all patients diagnosed with a first breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer from 1995 to 2015. We estimated incidence rates (IRs) of VTE according to the timing of the diagnosis of a second cancer. We controlled for\\xa0confounder variables in Poisson regression models.\\nIn total, 309,077 patients with a first breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer were included in the study. A second cancer was diagnosed in 20,090 (6.5%) of these patients. In total, 11,908 VTEs were observed in the study period, 786 of these occurred after a diagnosis of second cancer. Second cancer types such as pancreas and stomach cancer were associated with fivefold higher IRs of VTE compared with second cancer types such as breast and prostate cancer. The IR of VTE was highest within the first 6 months after the second cancer was diagnosed (IR 40.5 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 36.3-42.2) with no differences based on how long since the first cancer it was diagnosed.\\nThe epidemiology of VTE after a second cancer is similar to the epidemiology of VTE after a first cancer with higher rates within the first months after aggressive second cancer types. Drug resistance often occurs in the treatment of gastric cancer, which is the main cause of poor prognosis of chemotherapy. c-Met is overexpressed in a variety of tumors including gastric cancer, often leads to poor prognosis of gastric cancer, therefore regarded as a key target for the treatment of gastric cancer. This study aims to determine whether exosomes with si-c-Met could inhibit the resistance to cisplatin in gastric cancer (GC).\\nThe protein expression levels of c-Met in tumor tissues and normal tissues of patients were evaluated by Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), HEK293T cells were transfected with si-c-Met, exosomes were isolated, then co-cultured with gastric cancer cell lines and confirmed that it was incorporated into the cells by transmitted electron microscopy. Functional experiments were performed to examine the inhibitory effect of exo-si-c-Met on gastric cancer cell resistance in vitro, and xenograft models were used to reveal that exo-si-c-Met can enhance the sensitivity of tumors to cisplatin in vivo.\\nHigh expression of c-Met is associated with poor prognosis of GC patients. si-c-Met significantly inhibited migration, invasion and promoted apoptosis in vitro, which indicated that si-c-Met sensitizes the response of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin. Exo-si-c-Met sharply reduced c-Met expression in gastric cancer cells and reverse the resistance to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo.\\nOur results indicate that exo-si-c-Met can inhibit the invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells and promote apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo, reversing the resistance to cisplatin in gastric cancer. To investigate the efficacy of health coaching and a web-based program on survivor physical activity (PA), weight, and distress management among stomach, colon, lung and breast cancer patients.\\nThis randomised, controlled, 1-year trial conducted in five hospitals recruited cancer survivors within 2 months of completing primary cancer treatment who had not met ≥1 of these behavioural goals: (i) conducting moderate PA for at least 150\\u2009minutes/week or strenuous exercise for over 75\\u2009minutes per week or, in the case of lung cancer patients, low or moderate intensity exercise for over 12.5 MET per week, (ii) maintaining normal weight, and (iii) attaining a score\\u2009>72 in the Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control group, a web-only group, or a health coaching + web group. The primary endpoint was based on a composite of PA, weight, and PTGI score at 12\\u2009months.\\nPatients in the health coaching + web group (difference = 6.6%, P = .010) and the web-only group (difference = 5.9%, P = .031) had greater overall improvements across the three-outcome composite than the control group. The health coaching + web group had greater overall improvement in PTGI (difference = 12.6%; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001) than the control group, but not in PA and weight.\\nThe web-based program, with or without health coaching, may improve health behaviours including PA, weight, and distress management among cancer survivors within 2 months of completing primary cancer treatment. The web-based program with health coaching was mainly effective for reducing psychological distress. Whether splenectomy for splenic hilar lymph node (No. 10) dissection in type 4 gastric cancer involving the greater curvature is necessary is not established. Patients with type 4 gastric cancer often experience peritoneal relapse, despite curative surgery, and total gastrectomy with splenectomy is frequently associated with infectious complications.\\nPatients with cT2-T4 gastric cancer in the upper or middle third of the stomach, or both, involving the greater curvature who underwent R0 total gastrectomy with splenectomy between 2006 and 2016 were selected. Clinicopathological findings, postoperative complications, the incidence of lymph node metastasis, and the therapeutic value index of each station were compared between type 4 and non-type 4 gastric cancer.\\nWe enrolled 50 patients with type 4 and 60 with non-type 4. The former had a significantly higher proportion of the undifferentiated type and larger and deeper tumors. The overall incidence of Grade III or higher complications was 20.9%. The incidence of No. 10 metastasis was 26.0% in type 4 and 31.7% in non-type 4. Although the therapeutic value index of the No. 10 was 13.7 in type 4 and 15.0 in non-type 4, the index of type 4 ranked just below several peri-gastric stations and seventh, while that in non-type 4 ranked second.\\nSplenectomy for No. 10 dissection may be oncologically valid for type 4 gastric cancer involving the greater curvature. A safer procedure for No. 10 dissection should be established. Claudins are a family of transmembrane proteins which are essential for the formation and maintenance of epithelial tight junctions. Altered expression of claudins may lead to structural and functional damage of tight junctions, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The expression of claudin-3 in gastric cancer is not yet well understood.\\nTo evaluate the expression of claudin-3 in gasric cancer and in adjacent normal mucosa and its association with clinical and pathological parameters.\\nTissue specimens from a total of 69 patients with gastric cancer were obtained. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed using mouse polyclonal antibodies to claudin-3.\\nThe expression of claudin-3 in gastric cancer was significantly higher than in adjacent normal mucosa (p<0,05). The absence of claudin-3 was significantly associated with poor differentiation (p<0,05). An abnormal nuclear expression of claudin-3 was observed in 69.6% cases. A significant association was found between nuclear expression and the absence of membranous claudin-3 expression (p<0,05).\\nКлаудины являются одними из основных белков плотных контактов эпителиальных клеток. Изменение уровня экспрессии клаудинов может приводить к нарушению функции плотных контактов, что играет важную роль в прогрессии злокачественных новообразований. Экспрессия клаудина-3 в раке желудка изучена недостаточно. Цель исследования - изучить экспрессию клаудина-3 в раке желудка и в прилежащей нормальной слизистой оболочке и оценить взаимосвязь уровня экспрессии с основными клинико-морфологическими характеристиками опухоли. Материал и методы. В исследование включены образцы биопсийного и операционного материала от 69 пациентов с раком желудка. Для постановки иммуногистохимических реакций использовали поликлональные мышиные антитела к клаудину-3. Результаты. Экспрессия клаудина-3 в раке желудка была статистически значимо выше, чем в прилежащей нормальной слизистой оболочке (p<0,05). Отсутствие экспрессии клаудина-3 в раке желудка значимо ассоциировано с низкой степенью дифференцировки опухоли (p<0,05). В 69,6% случаев в раке желудка наблюдалась ядерная экспрессия клаудина-3, которая была ассоциирована с отсутствием мембранной экспрессии маркера (p<0,05). Заключение. Впервые описана аномальная ядерная экспрессия клаудина-3 в раке желудка и установлена значимая ассоциация между наличием ядерной экспрессии и отсутствием типичной мембранной экспрессии маркера. Экспрессия клаудина-3 может потенциально рассматриваться в качестве прогностического фактора при раке желудка. Perforation of a marginal peptic ulcer after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) can lead to severe conditions, although its clinical features have not been well reported. In this article, we present three cases of marginal peptic ulcer perforation after PD that we experienced in our institute and attempt to clarify its appropriate treatment and prevention.\\nMarginal ulcer perforation confirmed with computed tomography and/or surgical exploration occurred in 3 (1.8%) of 163 consecutive patients who underwent PD (including 160 patients who underwent a total or subtotal stomach-preserving procedure) at our institution. The three patients (one man and two women) had a median age of 77 (65-79) years. Two of these patients had a medical history of duodenal peptic ulcer. All three patients had biliary neoplasms. Two of the patients underwent subtotal stomach-preserving PD with antro-jejunal anastomosis, and the other patient underwent pylorus-preserving PD with duodenal jejunostomy. The perforation occurred with a sudden and severe onset of abdominal pain 34, 94, and 1204\\u2009days, respectively, after the PDs. At the time of the perforation, all of the patients had been withdrawn from postoperative prophylactic antipeptic ulcer agents, with the cessation periods ranging from 12 to 1008\\u2009days. In addition, all the patients were in fasting conditions for 1 to 13\\u2009days just before the perforation. Surgical treatment with direct suturing of the perforated ulcer was performed for two patients, while conservative therapy was performed for one patient. Their primary treatment courses were satisfactory. Chronic antisecretory agent therapy was prescribed for 562, 271, and 2370\\u2009days, respectively, from marginal ulcer perforation, and no ulcer recurrence was noted in any of the patients.\\nLack of antisecretory therapy and fasting were considered an essential cause of marginal peptic ulcer perforation after PD. In addition, unlike the native duodenum, the jejunal limb used for reconstruction to a preserved stomach may be at increased risk of ulceration. Chronic permanent administration of antisecretory agents and fasting avoidance are desirable for patients who have undergone stomach-preserving PD to prevent marginal ulcer perforation. An excellent assistant for robotic radical gastrectomy can play an important role in the operation, especially in a initial team. In robotic gastric cancer surgery, an excellent assistant should actively participate in the operation process, choose the appropriate trocar position according to patient\\'s body habitus. Moreover, he should master various surgical instruments skillfully and switch instruments fluently to assist the surgeon to expose key parts during operation, and provide effective help in the operative details, so that the whole operation process can run more smoothly and the operation efficiency and quality will be greatly improved. The growth of the assistants needs constant practice and summary of experience. Meanwhile, the encouragement of the chief surgeon also plays a positive role in promoting the development of the assistants.\\n一位优秀的机器人胃癌根治术的助手在术中可发挥重要作用，尤其是在初期开展的团队中，其作用显得更为重要。在机器人胃癌手术中，优秀的助手应积极参与手术进程。主要包括以下几点：对不同体型的患者选择合适的戳卡孔位置；熟练地掌握各种手术器械并可以流利地转换器械；在关键部位协助主刀进行暴露；在手术细节上给主刀提供积极有效的帮助。这样才能使整个胃癌手术过程更为流畅，手术效率及手术质量大大提高。当然，助手的成长需要不断地进行练习和经验总结，同时主刀的鼓励对助手的成长也有着积极促进作用。.     Robotic gastric cancer surgery in China showed a broad application prospects with the development in the past ten years, but there are also prominent issues, such as low penetration, non-standard operation, and lack of high-quality research. This paper surmarizes the history and present situation, problems and consideration as well as future prospects of robotic gastric cancer surgery in China. The development of robotic gastric cancer surgery in China can be divided into three stages: initial exploratory stage (before 2013, the topics were mainly focused on surgical procedures, safety and feasibility of robotic gastrectomy), stable advancing stage (between 2014 and 2017, the number of centers, cases, types of gastrectomy, and clinical research were increased steadily), and rapid advancing stage (since 2018, the number of centers, cases, and clinical research were increased rapidly). The robotic gastric cancer surgery in China is still in the growth period. We should grasp the development direction of robotic gastrectomy and promote the rapid and favorable development of robotic gastric cancer surgery in China, which can bring benefits for patients.\\n我国机器人胃癌外科经过10年的发展取得了长足进步，展现出广阔的应用前景，同时也存在普及率低、手术尚不够规范、缺乏高质量研究等问题。本文总结我国机器人胃癌手术开展历史与现状、存在的问题与思考，并对未来发展进行展望。纵观我国机器人胃癌外科的发展历程，大致可分为三个阶段：起步探索期（2013年之前，我国的机器人胃癌手术处于起步阶段，主要探讨机器人胃癌手术的手术方法、操作流程、安全性及可行性）、稳步推进期（2014—2017年期间，我国机器人胃癌手术开展中心数量、手术例数、手术种类、临床研究稳步推进）、快速推进期（2018年开始，我国机器人胃癌手术开展中心数量、手术例数、临床研究快速增长）。我国机器人胃癌外科仍处于发展成长期，我们要把握机器人胃癌手术发展方向，推动我国机器人胃癌外科健康快速发展，造福广大患者。.  Gastric cancer is the fifth malignancy and the third cause of cancer death worldwide, according to the global cancer statistics presented in 2018. Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification, which took effect in 2018. Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing. The cornerstone of GC treatment is surgical, in a context of multimodal therapy. Surgical treatment is being standardized, and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments. This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of mini-invasive techniques. Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view, with better short-term outcomes. The persecution of better short-term outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management, which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles. In the era of precision medicine, multimodal treatment is also evolving. The long-time-awaited results of many trials investigating the role for preoperative and postoperative management have been published, changing the clinical practice. Novel investigations focused both on traditional chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted therapies are currently ongoing. Modern platforms increase the possibility for further standardization of the different treatments, promote the use of big data and open new possibilities for surgical learning. This systematic review in two parts assesses all the current updates in GC treatment. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the cancer risks among firefighters in the time course and from different geographical areas.\\nA PubMed search was performed to identify cohort studies about cancer risk and firefighting presented with standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) or standardized mortality ratios (SMRs). Using random-effect models, meta-relative risk estimates (mSIRs, mSMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were assessed. Cohort studies with employment starting before 1950 were classified as \"old\", studies starting between 1950 and 1970 as \"medium\", and later studies as \"new\".\\nThe general cancer risk of firefighters was similar to the general population, but mSMR decreased over time (new studies: mSMR\\u2009=\\u20090.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.92). We observed an increase of mSIR for melanoma of the skin and prostate cancer as well as a decrease of mSIR for stomach cancer with later employment onset. For those cancer sites, we did not observe a secular trend of mSMRs. Regional differences between relative cancer risks were particularly observed for bladder cancer.\\nAmong other things, innovative firefighting techniques and better personal protective equipment have provided a safer and healthier working environment for firefighters over time leading to a reduction of overall cancer incidence and mortality ratios. Increased general preventive medical checkups and possible additional screenings for firefighters might have led to more findings of malignant melanoma of the skin and prostate cancer in the recent past. The impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) on patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) of the stomach is unclear. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effects of NAC on patients with these conditions.\\nThis study included patients with locally advanced NEC or MANEC of the stomach who underwent gastrectomy. Histologic and prognostic effects of NAC were assessed. The overall survival (OS) rate was used to compare treatment efficacies between NAC patients and surgery-first patients.\\nOf the 69 patients included in this study, 20 received NAC and 49 underwent surgery first after diagnosis. A total of 13 patients responded to NAC (including 3 with complete remission and 10 with partial remission) and 7 patients acquired stable disease status according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. One patient (5%) achieved a pathological complete response after NAC. Pathological tumor regression grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were observed in 1 (5%), 5 (25%), 3 (15%), 10 (50%), and 1 (5%) patient(s) with NAC, respectively. The incidence of postoperative complications was similar in the two groups. Patients in the NAC group demonstrated better OS than did patients in the surgery-first group (P\\u2009=\\u20090.032). Multivariate analyses showed that NAC, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the clinical N stage were independent factors affecting OS.\\nIn patients with locally advanced NEC and MANEC of the stomach, NAC significantly improved OS. Previous reports have revealed that circRNA_100876 was extremely important in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanism towards the role of circRNA_100876 in Gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. Here, we determined circRNA_100876 expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in twenty pairs of GC tissues and adjacent tissues. Our data indicated that the expression of circRNA_100876 was raised in GC tissues. In vitro, functional experiments confirmed that cell proliferation, invasion along with migration was promoted by circRNA_100876 in GC tissues. Simultaneously, relative luciferase assay uncovered that circRNA_100876 functioned as a sponge for miR-136, followed by retarding miR-136-induced inhibited effects on the corresponding target, MIEN1. Moreover, we revealed that the expression of MIEN1 was up-regulated and correlated to much worse prognosis of GC. Collectively, our data identified that the promotion of GC growth and metastasis induced by circRNA_100876 interacted with miR-136 and MIEN1, indicating an emerging announcement for uncovering the potential mechanism of GC progression. The gastroesophageal junction has been of clinical interest for some time due to its important role in preventing reflux of caustic stomach contents upward into the esophagus. Failure of this role has been identified as a key driver in gastroesophageal reflux disease, cancer of the lower esophagus, and aspiration-induced lung complications. Due to the large population burden and significant morbidity and mortality related to reflux barrier dysfunction, there is a pressing need to develop tissue engineering solutions which can replace diseased junctions. While good progress has been made in engineering the bodies of the esophagus and stomach, little has been done for the junction between the two. In this review, we discuss pertinent topics which should be considered as tissue engineers begin to address this anatomical region. The embryological development and adult anatomy and histology are discussed to provide context about the native structures which must be replicated. The roles of smooth muscle structures in the esophagus and stomach, as well as the contribution of the diaphragm to normal anti-reflux function are then examined. Finally, engineering considerations including mechanics and current progress in the field of tissue engineering are presented. Because of its rare indication and relatively simple reconstruction procedure (only choledochojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy) compared to those for pancreatoduodenectomy, the technical tips and pitfalls of total pancreatectomy are rarely discussed. Herein, we discuss a rare case of gastric volvulus 1 year after total pancreatectomy and provide advice to prevent such cases.\\nA 66-year-old woman underwent total pancreatectomy with splenectomy for mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas. Choledochojejunostomy (retro-colic route) and gastrojejunostomy (ante-colic route, Billroth II method) were performed for reconstruction. The final diagnosis was mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous adenoma of the pancreas without malignant neoplasm. She had no clinical symptoms, such as abdominal pain and fever, during postoperative follow-up. However, at 1 year postoperatively, she complained of abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed volvulus and perforation of the stomach. Emergent surgery was performed. The stomach fornix was located on the right side and was partly perforated. We resected the perforation site with a linear cutter® (New Type Linear Cutter, Ethicon, USA) and released the gastric volvulus. Moreover, we fixed the stomach to the left abdominal wall using non-absorbable thread. The cause of the perforation was clinically and pathologically unclear. Her serum albumin and cholinesterase levels temporarily decreased postoperatively, but gradually increased. A recurrence of volvulus-related symptoms has not been observed.\\nAfter total pancreatectomy with splenectomy, although the stomach is connected with the jejunum, it is typically fixed only by the pedicle of the left gastric artery and vein. In the present case, this anatomical change may have been a cause of the gastric volvulus. Thus, it might be better to fix the remnant stomach in total pancreatectomy with splenectomy. None Osteoarthritis (OA) a disease associated with joints and become severe with age, due to softening, inflammation and degradation of cartilage in joints. The agents that can target OA is needed, specifically without any side effects.  Trials of intraoperative chemical splanchnicectomy during resection of pancreatic and gastric masses resulted in significant difference in a patient\\'s postoperative pain. This study aims to determine if splanchnicectomy by alcohol neurolysis can relieve postoperative pain after gastrectomy and Whipple surgery. The study explores differences in outcomes at first four months after surgery.\\nFifty-eight patients with gastric and 60 patients with pancreatic resectable masses were included (28 were lost to follow-up). Each randomized in control and intervention subgroups. Intervention subgroups underwent chemical blockage of celiac ganglions by ethanol injection at both sides of suprapancreatic aorta. Participants were asked to report their pain intensity according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at specific times.\\nThe overall postoperative pain of injected Whipple and gastrectomy subgroups was lower than the noninjected Whipple and gastrectomy subgroups (\\nSplanchnicectomy is recommended for pain reduction after abdominal operations.  Helicobacter pylori (HP) colonizes the human stomach and induces acute gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, atrophic gastritis, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Increased virulence in HP isolates derives from harboring the cag (cytotoxin-associated genes) pathogenicity island (cagPAI). We analyzed the microvariants in cagPAI genes with the hypothesis that they may play an important role in determining HP virulence. We tested DNAs from cagA positive patients HP isolates; a total of 74 patients with chronic gastritis (CG, N\\u2009=\\u200937), intestinal metaplasia (IM, N\\u2009=\\u200921) or gastric cancer (GC, N\\u2009=\\u200916) from Mexico and Colombia. We selected 520 non-synonymous variants with at least 7.5% frequency in the original sequence outputs or with a minimum of 5 isolates with minor allele. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, no variants were statistically significantly associated with IM or GC. However, 19 non-synonymous showed conventional P-values < 0.05 comparing the frequency of the alleles between the isolates from subjects with gastritis and isolates from subjects with IM or GC; 12 of these showed a significant correlation with the severity of the disease. The present study revealed that several cagPAI genes from Latin American Western HP strains contains a number of non-synonymous variants in relatively high frequencies which could influence on the clinical outcome. However, none of the associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparison. Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) is a lysophospholipid mediator that suppresses cancer metastasis and osteoarthritis. It also has neuroprotective roles in diseases such as multiple sclerosis and delayed neuronal death following transient ischemia. In order to take advantage of the properties of cPA for the development of new therapeutic strategies, we have synthesized several cPA derivatives and discovered 2-carba-cPA (2ccPA) as a promising candidate. To develop 2ccPA as a therapeutic agent, we investigated the pharmacokinetic profile of 2ccPA by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in this study. When 2ccPA was administered intraperitoneally to mice at a dose of 1.6 mg/kg, the half-life of 2ccPA in plasma was 16 min. The 2ccPA, dosed intraperitoneally to mice at 16 mg/kg, distributed to each organ including brain at 20 min after dosing. It was found that 2ccPA was stable in neutral or alkaline conditions (e.g., intestine) but unstable in acidic conditions (e.g., stomach). When 2ccPA was orally administrated to rats as a gastro-resistant form using an enterosoluble capsule, plasma 2ccPA levels peaked at 2 h, slowly declined thereafter and persistently detected even at 10 h after administration. Here, we present the findings on the effect of the continuous release of 2ccPA from the capsule to reduce the lysophospholipase D activity and also decrease plasma levels of lysophosphatidic acid in rat. These findings will be useful in further studies for evaluating the application of 2ccPA in several disorders. Abiraterone acetate is a potent drug used for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. However, currently marketed product containing crystalline abiraterone acetate exhibits strong positive food effect which results in strict dosing regimen. In the present work, a rational approach towards design of novel abiraterone acetate formulations that would allow increased bioavailability on a fasting stomach and thus decreased food effect is presented. Precipitation experiments in biorelevant media were designed to assess pH induced precipitation of the drug and a pool of polymeric excipients was then screened for their potential to inhibit precipitation. The best performing polymeric excipients were subsequently used as carriers for the preparation of amorphous solid dispersions. Two main approaches were followed in order to formulate the drug. The first approach relies on the suppression of precipitation from a supersaturated solution whereas the second one is based on the hypothesis that when the release of the drug is tuned, optimal uptake of the drug can be reached. Optimized formulation prototypes were tested in a rat animal model in an incomplete block, randomized bioequivalence study to assess their relative bioavailability under fasting conditions. We show that both formulation approaches lead to increased bioavailability of abiraterone acetate on a fasting stomach with bioavailability in rats being enhanced up to 250% compared to the original drug product containing crystalline drug. Papillary gastric cancer (GC) is classified as differentiated adenocarcinoma, together with well-differentiated (WD) and moderately differentiated (MD) adenocarcinoma. This study evaluated the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in submucosal (SM) invasive papillary GC compared with other differentiated early GC types.\\nThis retrospective study involved three tertiary hospitals and enrolled 1,798 lesions with differentiated SM invasive GC treated with curative gastrectomy between March 2001 and December 2012. All pathology slides were reviewed, and clinicopathologic findings associated with LNM, including tumor size, location, gross type, ulceration, depth and width of SM invasion, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), were analyzed.\\nThe proportion of SM papillary GC was 2.8% (n=51). SM papillary GC was associated with larger tumor size and deeper and wider SM invasion than other differentiated GC types. LNM was significantly higher in the papillary type than in the MD and WD types. LNM was found in 27.5% of SM papillary GC patients (WD: 9.0%, MD: 21.2%). LVI was the only significant risk factor for LNM in SM papillary GC. The depth or width of SM invasion was not associated with LNM in papillary GC. Lower third location or elevated gross appearance was significantly associated with LVI.\\nSM papillary GC had the highest LNM rate, with features different from those of other differentiated SM invasive GCs. The treatment strategy for SM papillary GC should be carefully approached, especially for lesions located in the lower third or of the elevated gross type. Currently, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma (KS) is treated following the recommendations of international guidelines. These guidelines recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy for detecting multicentric KS of visceral lesions. Second primary malignancies (SPMs) are also a common KS complication; however, information on their detection and treatment is unfortunately not yet indicated in these guidelines. This paper reports on an 86-year-old man who suffered from quadruple primary malignancies: skin classic KS with colon adenocarcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma (maxilla), and well-differentiated stomach adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer was incidentally detected during esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was performed to detect visceral KS. We suggest that esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy be routinely performed during the follow-up of patients with KS. As SPMs are crucial complications in patients with KS, these malignancies should be detected as early as possible. The role of -251A>T polymorphism in the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene in gastric cancer was intensively evaluated, but the results of these studies were inconsistent.\\nTherefore, we performed a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive data on the association of IL-8 -251T>A polymorphism with gastric cancer.\\nAll eligible studies were identified in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Wanfang and CNKI databases before September 01, 2019. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from a fixed effect or random effect model.\\nA total of 33 case-control studies with 6,192 cases and 9,567 controls were selected. Overall, pooled data showed that IL-8 -251T>A polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer under all five genetic models, i.e., allele (A vs T: OR=1.189, 95% CI 1.027-1.378, P=0.021), homozygote (AA vs TT: OR=1.307, 95% CI 1.111-1.536, P=0.001), heterozygote (AT vs TT: OR=1.188, 95% CI 1.061-1.330, P=0.003), dominant (AA+AT vs TT: OR=1.337, 95% CI 1.115-1.602, P=0.002) and recessive (AA vs AT+TT: OR=1.241, 95% CI 1.045-1.474, P=0.014). The stratified analysis by ethnicity revealed an increased risk of gastric cancer in Asians and mixed populations, but not in Caucasians. Moreover, stratified by country found a significant association in Chinese, Korean and Brazilian, but not among Japanese.\\nThis meta-analysis suggests that the IL-8 -251T>A polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, especially by ethnicity (Asian and mixed populations) and country (Chinese, Korean and Brazilian). This study was designed to investigate the expression of RBM8A protein in patients with gastric cancer (GC) and to explore its correlation with clinical pathological features as well as prognosis. One hundred pairs of gastric carcinoma tissues and adjacent tissues from patients undergoing gastrectomy for GC were included in this study. The protein expression level of RBM8A was determined by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. We also detected the mRNA expression level of RBM8A in 16 pairs of gastric carcinoma tissues and adjacent tissues. Meanwhile, we predicted the potential correlation between RBM8A and tumor stages as well as survival condition in patents with GC based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The correlation of RBM8A with the clinical pathological features and prognosis of the 100 patients with GC was also elucidated. The expression level of RBM8A was significantly higher in gastric carcinoma tissues compared to the adjacent tissues. The protein level of RBM8A was correlated with tumor size (P=0.031), depth of invasion (P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), TNM stage (<0.001), and distant metastasis (P=0.001). Patients with increased RBM8A expression (P<0.0018, 95%CI=0.322-0.871), higher TNM stage (P<0.001, 95%CI=4.990-11.283), and lymph node metastasis (P<0.001, 95%CI=2.873-4.002) had a lower overall survival. Taken together, our study demonstrated that RBM8A may act as a proto-oncogene, which could be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in the diagnosis and treatment of GC. Little is known about host-microbiota interactions regulating anti-microbial immunity in the stomach. In this issue, Satoh-Takayama et\\xa0al. describe an additional immune mechanism involving innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2), which controls infection with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium associated with inflammation and cancer. Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson\\'s regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag. To estimate the baseline risk, sex, attained age, smoking status and alcohol consumption, chronic diseases (peptic ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis) were taken into account. No modifications of the radiogenic risk by non-radiation factors were found in the study worker cohort. No association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was observed.  Previous studies have shown that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LINC00483 was aberrantly expressed in human cancers, including gastric cancer. However, the regulatory mechanism of this lncRNA in gastric cancer remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of LINC00483 on gastric cancer development and explore the potential regulatory network of LINC00483/microRNA (miR)-490-3p/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1).\\nThirty patients with gastric cancer were recruited for tissues collection. The expression levels of LINC00483, miR-490-3p and MAPK1 were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were determined by MTT, flow cytometry, transwell assays and western blot, respectively. The target association between miR-490-3p and LINC00483 or MAPK1 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft model was established to assess the function of LINC00483 in vivo.\\nLINC00483 and MAPK1 levels were increased in gastric cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of LINC00483 or MAPK1 inhibited cells viability, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, MAPK1 overexpression attenuated the effect of LINC00483 knockdown on gastric cancer development. LINC00483 could increase MAPK1 expression by competitively sponging miR-490-3p. miR-490-3p overexpression suppressed gastric cancer development, which was abated by introduction of LINC00483. Besides, inhibition of LINC00483 decreased xenograft tumor growth by regulating miR-490-3p/MAPK1 axis.\\nKnockdown of LINC00483 inhibited gastric cancer development in vitro and in vivo by increasing miR-490-3p and decreasing MAPK1, elucidating a novel mechanism for understanding the development of gastric cancer. Gastrointestinal tract function and it\\'s integrity are controlled by a number of peptides whose secretion is influenced by severe inflammation. In stomach the main regulatory peptide is ghrelin. For upper small intestine cholecystokinin and lower small intestine glucagon-like peptide- 1 are secreted, while fibroblast growth factor-21 is secreted by several organs, including the liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue [12]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation causes serious mucosal damage, which can reflect on this peptides.\\nThe aim of the study was to determine fasting plasma concentrations of ghrelin, cholecystokinin, glucagon- like peptide-1, and fibroblast growth factor-21, and their gene expressions, before and 6\\u2009months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.27 children were studied, control group included 26 healthy children.\\nAcute graft versus host disease was diagnosed in 11 patients (41%, n\\xa0=\\u200927). Median pre-transplantation concentrations of gastrointestinal peptides, as well as their gene expressions, were significantly lower in studied group compared with the control group. Only median of fibroblast growth factor-21 concentration was near-significantly higher before stem cell transplantation than in the control group. The post-hematopoietic transplant results revealed significantly higher concentrations of the studied peptides (except fibroblast growth factor-21) and respective gene expressions as compare to pre transplant results. Median glucagone like peptide-1 concentrations were significantly decreased in patients with features of acute graft versus host disease. Moreover, negative correlation between glucagone like peptide-1 concentrations and acute graft versus host disease severity was found.\\nIncreased concentrations and gene expressions of gastrointestinal tract regulation peptides can be caused by stimulation of regeneration in the severe injured organ. Measurement of these parameters may be a useful method of assessment of severity of gastrointestinal tract complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Sepsis and cancer are both leading causes of death, and occurrence of any one, increases the likelihood of the other. While cancer patients are susceptible to sepsis, survivors of sepsis are also susceptible to develop certain cancers. This mutual dependence for susceptibility suggests shared biology between the two disease categories. Earlier analysis had revealed a cancer-related pathway to be up-regulated in Septic Shock (SS), an advanced stage of sepsis. This has motivated a more comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomes of SS and cancer.\\nGene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to detect the pathways enriched in SS and cancer. Thereafter, hierarchical clustering was applied to identify relative segregation of 17 cancer types into two groups vis-a-vis SS. Biological significance of the selected pathways was explored by network analysis. Clinical significance of the pathways was tested by survival analysis. A robust classifier of cancer groups was developed based on machine learning.\\nA total of 66 pathways were observed to be enriched in both SS and cancer. However, clustering segregated cancer types into two categories based on the direction of transcriptomic change. In general, there was up-regulation in SS and one group of cancer (termed Sepsis-Like Cancer, or SLC), but not in other cancers (termed Cancer Alone, or CA). The SLC group mainly consisted of malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract (head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, liver and biliary system) often associated with infection. Machine learning classifier successfully segregated the two cancer groups with high accuracy (>\\u200998%). Additionally, pathway up-regulation was observed to be associated with survival in the SLC group of cancers.\\nTranscriptome-based systems biology approach segregates cancer into two groups (SLC and CA) based on similarity with SS. Host response to infection plays a key role in pathogenesis of SS and SLC. However, we hypothesize that some component of the host response is protective in both SS and SLC. Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is a stomach-specific tumor suppressor that is secreted into extracellular space as an exosomal cargo protein. The objective of this study was to investigate the uptake and tumor-suppressive pathways of exosome-associated GKN1 protein in gastric epithelial cells.\\nImmunofluorescent and Western blot analysis were used to investigate gastric-specific uptake of HFE-145-derived exosomes. Binding affinity of HFE-145 derived exosomes with integrin proteins was examined using protein microarray chip. Tumor suppressor activities of exosome-carrying GKN1 protein were analyzed using transwell co-culture, MTT assay, BrdU incorporation, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis.\\nHFE-145-derived exosomes were internalized only into HFE-145 gastric epithelial cells and gastric cancer cells. Gastric-specific uptake of stomach-derived exosomes required integrin α6 and αX proteins. Clathrin and macropinocytosis increased the uptake of exosomes into gastric epithelial cells, whereas caveolin inhibited the uptake of exosomes. Transwell co-culture of AGS cells with HFE-145 cells markedly inhibited viability and proliferation of AGS cells. Following uptake of HFE-145-derived exosomes in recipient cells, GKN1 protein bound to HRas and inhibited the binding of HRas to b-Raf and c-Raf which subsequently downregulated HRas/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways in AGS, MKN1 cells, and MKN1-derived xenograft tumor tissues. In addition, exosomal GKN1 protein suppressed both migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\\nGastric-specific uptake of exosomes derived from gastric epithelial cells requires integrin α6 and αX proteins in both gastric epithelial cells and exosomes. Exosomal GKN1 protein inhibits gastric carcinogenesis by downregulating HRas/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways.  The incidence of lower esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma has sharply increased over the past several decades and is a serious public health problem. Preoperative therapy with either chemotherapy or chemoradiation is recommended, but the optimal regimen is unknown. We used the National Cancer Database and propensity score matching to investigate whether preoperative chemoradiation therapy offers an advantage over chemotherapy alone for patients with these tumors.\\nFrom the National Cancer Database esophageal and gastric dataset, we selected patients with either lower esophageal or gastric cardia adenocarcinomas who had undergone definitive resection after chemotherapy or chemoradiation. We used propensity score matching to balance groups based on the preoperative treatment they received. We then used conditional multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between preoperative therapy regimen and pathological response, overall survival (OS), and postoperative outcomes.\\nOur study included 13,783 patients; 12,129 (89.0%) had received preoperative chemoradiation. Propensity score matching created 1650 pairs. Patients receiving chemoradiation were 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.29-3.23) times more likely to achieve complete response in the primary tumor than were those receiving chemotherapy alone; however, chemoradiation was not associated with improved OS (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.12). Short-term outcomes (length of stay, mortality, and readmissions) were similar between the 2 groups.\\nPreoperative chemoradiation was associated with a higher complete response rate in the primary tumor but not with improved OS in lower esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. None None Methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD) is a serious complication in patients treated using methotrexate. It occasionally develops in extra-nodal sites, but rarely in the central nervous system (CNS) or in 2 different sites at the same time. We present the rare case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who developed lymphoma in the CNS and stomach during MTX therapy.\\nA 75-year-old Japanese man with rheumatoid arthritis who received methotrexate was admitted to our hospital because of gait ataxia and anorexia.\\nImaging findings and biopsy led to a diagnosis of 2 different types of MTX-LPD in the central nervous system and stomach.\\nThe lesion in his stomach improved after methotrexate withdrawal, whereas the cerebellar mass required high-dose methotrexate and rituximab therapy.\\nComplete remission has been maintained for the 2 years following the initiation of chemotherapy.\\nIn patients with RA who receive MTX and develop new neurological symptoms, CNS lymphoma as an MTX-LPD may be considered as a differential diagnosis. To investigate computed tomography and angiography findings and clinical outcomes after transcatheter arterial embolization for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding from advanced gastric cancers.From January 2005 to December 2014, 58 patients with pathologically proven gastric cancer were treated at our institution with transcatheter arterial embolization due to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding recalcitrant to endoscopic treatment. The electronic medical records for each patient were reviewed for clinical presentation, endoscopy history, computed tomography and angiographic findings, blood transfusion requirements, and follow-up results.Angiography findings were positive in 13 patients (22.4%): contrast extravasation was found in 9 patients and pseudoaneurysm in 4 patients. All patients with positive angiograms underwent selective embolization treatment. Those with negative angiography findings underwent empirical embolization. Gelfoam, n-butyl cyanoacrylate, coils, or a combination of these were used as embolic agents. The overall clinical success rate was 72.4% (42/58), and the success rate for patients with positive angiography was 53.8% (7/13). The median survival was 97.5 days (range, 7-1415 days), and the 1-month survival rate was 89.6% (52/58). The 1-month survival rate of the clinical success group was 95.2% (40/42), which was significantly higher than that of the clinical failure group (P\\u200a=\\u200a.04). The clinical success group also required significantly fewer transfusions (2.43 units, range 0-24 units) (P\\u200a=\\u200a.02).Transcatheter arterial embolization is a highly effective treatment for advanced gastric cancer with active bleeding. It should be considered as an additional treatment, especially when endoscopic or surgical treatment fails or when these approaches are difficult. A 78-year-old woman with a chief complaint of mammary tumor was referred to our hospital and was diagnosed with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma using needle biopsies. She presented with MALT lymphoma lesions in the stomach, duodenum, and intraperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed thickened internal layer of the bile duct. Cholangiocarcinoma, immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis, and MALT lymphoma were suspected. She did not report any abdominal pain, and did not have jaundice. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and intraductal ultrasonography indicated diffuse, irregular wall thickening with the formation of nodule lesions in the extrahepatic bile duct. Transpapillary cytology indicated CD20-positive atypical lymphocytes. MALT lymphoma of the bile duct was diagnosed. CVP with rituximab therapy was performed. After treatment, computed tomography, gastrointestinal endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, intraductal ultrasonography, and transpapillary cytology revealed that the tumor and the biliary wall thickening had disappeared. It is difficult to diagnose MALT lymphoma of the bile duct. We report a case in which intraductal ultrasound and transpapillary cytology were useful for establishing a diagnosis and evaluating the therapy for MALT lymphoma of the bile duct. We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with a collision cancer of primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma in the stomach that was cured surgically. She achieved complete remission after treatment (R-CHOP and radiation therapy;40.8Gy/22Fr) for a non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma of diffuse large B cell type from September 2016 to April 2017. In August 2018, endoscopic findings showed a type 3 tumor with a white coat on the posterior wall of the upper gastric body. A biopsied specimen showed that the tumor was a SCC. Total gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and D2 lymph node dissection were performed. Pathological examination showed a SCC invasion to the spleen, and normal gastric mucosa between the esophagus and SCC of the stomach. Based on the pathological TNM classification, the tumors were T4N1M0 (Stage IIIB) for the SCC and T1N0M0 (Stage IA) for the adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1, and was recurrence free at 9 months after the surgery. BackgroundAlthough the incidence and mortality have decreased, gastric cancer (GC) is still a public health issue globally. An international study reported higher survival in Korea and Japan than other countries, including the US. We examined the determinant factors of the high survival in Japan, compared with the US.MethodsWe analysed data on 78,648 cases from the nationwide GC registration project, the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association (JGCA), from 2004-2007 and compared them with 16,722 cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER), a US population-based cancer registry data from 2004-2010. We estimated five-year relative survival and applied a multivariate excess hazard model to compare the two countries, considering the effect of number of lymph nodes (LNs) examined.ResultsFive-year relative survival in Japan was 81.0%, compared with 45.0% in the US. After controlling for confounding factors, we still observed significantly higher survival in Japan. Among N2 patients, a higher number of LNs examined showed better survival in both countries. Among N3 patients, the relationship between number of LNs examined and differences in survival between the two countries disappeared.ConclusionAlthough the wide differences in GC survival between Japan and US can be largely explained by differences in the stage at diagnosis, the number of LNs examined may also help to explain the gaps between two countries, which is related to stage migration.  The role of cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in gastric cancer is unknown. This non-randomized dose-finding phase I-II study was designed to assess the safety and feasibility of HIPEC, following systemic chemotherapy, in patients with gastric cancer and limited peritoneal dissemination. The maximum tolerated dose of normothermic intraperitoneal docetaxel in combination with a fixed dose of intraperitoneal oxaliplatin was also explored.\\nPatients with resectable cT3-cT4a gastric adenocarcinoma with limited peritoneal metastases and/or tumour-positive peritoneal cytology were included.

The relationship between genetic polymorphisms and cancer risk has been extensively researched. In the present study, we evaluated the association between polymorphisms in two DNA repair genes, ERCC2 Lys751Gln (rs13181) and XRCC2 Arg188His (rs3218536) and the risk of colorectal, stomach, HCC, prostate and lung cancer.\\nThis study was planned by the Medical Biology Unit and Department of Internal Medicine, Pathology and Surgical Medicine Sciences of Ataturk University. A total of 40 colon cancer, 40 gastric cancer, 40 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 40 prostate cancer, and 40 lung cancer patients and 40 healthy individuals over 18 years of age were enrolled in the study (Controls). All patients and healthy subjects underwent ERCC2 Lys751Gln rs13181 and XRCC2 Arg188His rs3218536 genotyping. After collection of 10 ml venous blood from the patients, DNA was isolated and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed using Roche 480 Real-Time PCR device. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 23.0 software.\\nThere were statistically significant differences in ERCC2 Lys751Gln rs13181 polymorphism variants GG colon and GT in the colon control and GG,TTprostate cancer groups when compared with the control group.. GG variant of XRCC2 Arg188 rs3218536 was higher in the gastric patient group. AG variant of XRCC2 Arg188 rs3218536 was higher in gastric control group Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrate that ERC22 Lys751Gln polymorphisms may be associated with the development of colon and prostate cancers in the Turkish population. This was a small-scale study, and the results should be corroborated with further research including larger groups of patients with each cancer type and more healthy controls. Nodal status represents probably the most important determinant of gastric cancer prognosis. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of the primary tumor\\'s T stage on lymph node harvesting after D1 resections for gastric cancer.\\nBetween January 2000 and January 2012, the medical files of patients who presented to our department with the diagnosis of gastric cancer and were submitted to a gastric resection with curative intent were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 134 gastric cancer patients (mean age 67.36±9.64 - 35 females and 99 males) were submitted to a gastrectomy in our department (total or subtotal) with curative intent. The distribution of the tumors within the stomach was as follows: upper third - 37 patients, middle third - 49 patients and lower third - 46 patients.\\nLymph node retrieval was superior in advanced T stage patients (T3,T4a/T4b) compared to their low T stage (T1a/T1b,T2) counterparts (p=0.0008). Similar findings were encountered when the comparison was reduced to the subtotal gastrectomy subgroup (p=0.0047). However, although there was a distinct trend, statistical significance was not reached for the patient group submitted to total gastrectomy (p=0.1088).\\nThe results of the present study seem to add another value i.e. tumor\\'s T stage in the equation of lymph node retrieval in gastric cancer resection specimens. Lymph node retrieval in gastric cancer patients appeared to be dependent to the primary tumors T stage in the given patient sample. Jejunogastric intussusception (JGI) is a rare but severe complication after gastric surgery. JGI can occur from a few days to 55\\u2009years postoperatively and has a reported incidence of <\\u20090.1% in patients who undergo gastric surgery. We firstly report a male patient with duodenal cancer who underwent Whipple\\'s procedure with side-to-side gastrojejunostomy and who subsequently developed JGI. A literature review is provided.\\nA 68-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with left upper quadrant abdominal pain and hematemesis of 4\\u2009h\\' duration. He had undergone Whipple\\'s procedure (duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy and side-to-side gastrojejunostomy) with B-II reconstruction for duodenal papillary adenocarcinoma 5\\u2009years earlier. His vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 163/93\\u2009mmHg, temperature of 37.0\\u2009°C; and heart and respiratory rates of 86 per/min and 20 per/min, respectively. Physical assessment showed mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant, only. A complete blood count showed white cell and platelet counts of 11.69\\u2009×\\u200910\\nJGI is a rare but potentially fatal complication after gastric surgery, especially following Whipple\\'s procedure. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial, and surgery is considered the most effective treatment for JGI. Transrectal laparoscopy (TRLS) using a flexible endoscope was recently proposed for peritoneal observation. Although previous studies have reported its feasibility, follow-up durations were insufficient to ascertain technical safety. Moreover, knowledge about the technical feasibility of collecting peritoneal cytological lavage or ascites during TRLS is limited. Thus, this study aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of TRLS in a porcine survival model.\\nAfter creating artificial ascites in 10 animals, TRLS was performed as follows: submucosal tunnel creation on the anterior wall of the rectum, intentional perforation at the distal end of the tunnel, endoscopic ascites collection and intraperitoneal observation, and clip closure at the mucosal incision site. The pigs were administered antibiotics orally for 7\\xa0days after TRLS and killed for histological evaluation and bacterial culture after 28\\xa0days of observation.\\nThe technical success rates of insertion into the abdominal cavity, ascites collection, and clip closure were 100%. All frequent anatomical sites for peritoneal dissemination including the stomach, subdiaphragmatic space, and pelvic space were fully observable without adverse events. The median procedure time was 36.3\\xa0min. Full 28-day survival was observed in all cases without any infection. The autopsies showed no infection, including abscess formation. Bacterial cultures of the peritoneal cavity were negative 28\\xa0days after TRLS in all cases.\\nTransrectal laparoscopy enabled ascites collection and intraperitoneal observation without adverse events. All animals survived without peritonitis. Therefore, TRLS can be an option for intraperitoneal examination. Heparanase is upregulated in various tumors, and its expression is closely associated with tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, which accomplishes this mainly through degrading heparan sulfate and releasing heparin-binding growth factors thereby influencing multiple signaling pathways. In addition to its enzymatic degrading activity, heparanase can act via its non-enzymatic mechanisms that directly regulate various signaling. This review mainly focuses on the expression levels and role of heparanase in gastric cancer, and multiple genes and mechanisms regulating heparanase expression in gastric cancer. Furthermore, the development of heparanase-targeted immunotherapy and its potential application for treating gastric cancer are discussed. Advanced gastric cancer (AGC) and primary gastric lymphoma (PGL) are the two most common malignant tumors of the stomach. Conventional imaging examinations have difficulty distinguishing the two. This study explored the values of multiple parameters and visual assessment of \\nThis retrospective study included 70 AGC and 26 PGL patients, all of whom had undergone \\nThe most common metastasis of AGC patients were liver, bone, peritoneal and proximal lymph nodes; PGL patients had fewer peritoneal metastases and lymph node metastasis could appeared to be \"skip metastasis.\" The metabolic parameters-SUVmax, SUVmax/THKmax and TLG-were higher in patients who had PGL, especially in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In the visual assessment of  Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) of the pancreas complicated by fistula formation to adjacent organs are an uncommon phenomenon. We present an IPMN of the pancreas with malignant transformation and multiple fistulae to the stomach and duodenum. \\nThis case highlights the importance investigating patients for the aetiology in recurrent acute pancreatitis and their follow-up. Awareness of cystic pancreatic neoplasms including IPMN is important to avoid misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Referral of these patients to centres with facilities for multidisciplinary input and specialised management is strongly recommended. Different approaches are used to treat resectable tumours in patients having adenocarcinoma at the oesophagogastrointestinal junction (EGJ) or in the stomach. However, there is limited information about treatment efficacy for patients at metastatic stage. A recent molecular analysis of upper gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinoma revealed that the anatomical location can influence the molecular backgrounds of tumours. This study sought to elucidate whether different therapeutic approaches should be used for EGJ tumours relative to those in the stomach.\\nThis retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single institute in Japan. Patients having metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma in the EGJ or stomach who underwent platinum doublet chemotherapy between January 2007 and August 2014 were enrolled. Patients in the EGJ tumour group had tumours having an epicentre within 2\\u2009cm proximal or 5\\u2009cm distal to the estimated anatomical EGJ and cardia.\\nAmong 378 consecutively enrolled patients, 61 were grouped into the EGJ group and the remainder comprised the stomach group. The EGJ group had more men and lower incidence of diffuse type and Borrmann type IV tumours and peritoneum metastasis compared with the stomach group. The median overall survival of patients in the EGJ and stomach groups was similar (17.3 months (95%\\u2009CI 13.5 to 23.2) vs 14.5 months (95%\\u2009CI 13.3 to 16.4)). No statistically significant difference was observed in progression-free survival. Although the overall postprogression survival differed significantly between the EGJ and stomach groups (8.2 months (95%\\u2009CI 5.7 to 12.7) vs 7.1 months (95%\\u2009CI 6.1 to 7.8)), on grouping patients by histological type, the two groups exhibited similar postprogression survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diffuse-type histology, higher serum CA19-9 levels and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios were independent poor prognostic factors.\\nDifferent clinicopathological features of EGJ adenocarcinoma were not associated with clinical outcomes of platinum doublet chemotherapy. Histological subtype rather than anatomical location has more significance for treatment decisions for advanced gastric cancers. Dacomitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor approved for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first line in patients with EGFR activating mutations. Dacomitinib is taken orally once daily at 45 mg with or without food, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Oncology patients often can develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which may require management with an acid-reducing agent. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as rabeprazole, inhibit sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H\\nThe pooled dataset consisted of five clinical pharmacology healthy volunteer studies, which collected serial pharmacokinetic concentration-time profiles of dacomitinib. Non-linear mixed effects modeling was carried out to characterize dacomitinib pharmacokinetics in the presence and absence of the concomitant use of a PPI, rabeprazole. Several absorption models, some more empirical, and some more physiologically based, were tested: transit compartment, first-order absorption with and without lag time, and variations of combined zero- and first-order absorption kinetics models.\\nThe presence of a PPI was a significant covariate affecting the extent ( Aspirin has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, and possibly of a few other digestive tract cancers. The quantification of risk reduction and the optimal dose and duration of aspirin use for the prevention of colorectal and other digestive tract cancers remains unclear.\\nTo provide an up-to-date quantification of this association, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational studies on aspirin and cancers of the digestive tract sites published through March 2019. We estimated the pooled relative risk (RR) of cancer for regular aspirin use versus non-use using random-effects models, and, whenever data were available, we investigated the dose- and duration-risk relations.\\nRegular aspirin use is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer [RR\\xa0= 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI)\\xa0= 0.69-0.78, 45 studies], squamous-cell esophageal cancer (RR\\xa0= 0.67, 95% CI\\xa0= 0.57-0.79, 13 studies), adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastric cardia (RR\\xa0= 0.61, 95% CI\\xa0= 0.49-0.77, 10 studies), stomach cancer (RR\\xa0= 0.64, 95% CI\\xa0= 0.51-0.82, 14 studies), hepato-biliary tract cancer (RR\\xa0= 0.62, 95% CI\\xa0= 0.44-0.86, five studies), and pancreatic cancer (RR\\xa0= 0.78, 95% CI\\xa0= 0.68-0.89, 15 studies), but not of head and neck cancer (RR\\xa0= 0.94, 95% CI\\xa0= 0.76-1.16, 10 studies). The associations are somewhat stronger in case-control than in cohort and nested case-control studies and are characterized by some between-study heterogeneity. Risk estimates are consistent across sex, geographical areas, and other selected covariates. For colorectal cancer, an aspirin dose between 75 and 100 mg/day conveys a risk reduction of 10%, and a dose of 325 mg/day of 35%. For all neoplasms, except head and neck cancer, inverse duration-risk relations with aspirin use are found.\\nThe present comprehensive meta-analysis supports and further quantifies the inverse association between regular aspirin use and the risk of colorectal and other digestive tract cancers, including some rare ones. The favorable effect of aspirin increases with longer duration of use, and, for colorectal cancer, with increasing dose. Synchronous gastric cancer and adenomatous colorectal polyp in patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced pyogenic liver abscess (KP-PLA) and bacteremia is a rare presentation. A 58-year-old man with a 6-month history of diabetes mellitus (DM) presented with febrile sensation and dull abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Subsequent to laboratory test results and abdominal computed tomography findings, KP-PLA with bacteremia was diagnosed. After intravenous antibiotic administration, his symptoms improved, and upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed to evaluate the cause of KP-PLA. Biopsy specimens of the prepyloric anterior wall revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic mucosal resection of the colon revealed high-grade dysplasia. Early gastric cancer (EGC) and adenomatous colorectal polyps with high-grade dysplasia concomitant with KP-PLA and bacteremia were diagnosed in our patient who had DM. Intravenous antibiotic treatment for KP-PLA, subtotal gastrectomy for EGC, and colonoscopic mucosal resection for the colon polyp were performed. After 25 days of hospitalization, subtotal gastrectomy with adjacent lymph node dissection was performed. Follow-up ultrasound imaging showed resolution of the abscess 5 weeks post-antibiotic treatment, as well as no tumor metastasis. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy should be performed to evaluate gastric cancer in patients with PLA or bacteremia, accompanied with DM or an immunocompromised condition. Serum pepsinogens have been widely acknowledged as gastric mucosal biomarkers; however, a multicountry report on the benefits of pepsinogens as biomarkers has not yet been published. We analyzed 1,206 sera and gastric mucosal samples collected from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand then assessed the association between gastric mucosal changes and Helicobacter pylori infection. The new cutoff values for serum pepsinogen values were evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic analysis. The participants with H. pylori infection had significantly lower pepsinogen I and higher pepsinogen II values, but a lower pepsinogen I/II ratio than participants without the infection (all P < .001). The pepsinogen I and pepsinogen I/II values were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in individuals with atrophic gastritis than in those without (both P < .001). Among uninfected individuals, only the pepsinogen I/II ratio was significantly lower in atrophic individuals. Pepsinogen I/II ratio also were significantly different between disease among H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative individuals, suggesting the pepsinogen I/II ratio is a robust biomarker for determining both chronic and atrophic gastritis. The cutoffs for detecting chronic and atrophic gastritis for the pepsinogen I/II ratio were 4.65 and 4.95, respectively. In conclusion, pepsinogen levels are useful biomarker for both chronic gastritis and atrophic gastritis, but they should be used with caution. Population-based validation is necessary to determine the best cutoff values. Among all pepsinogen values, the pepsinogen I/II ratio was the most reliable gastric mucosal-change biomarker. Acquired cystic disease of kidney-associated renal cell carcinoma (ACD-RCC) is a distinct subtype of renal cell carcinoma with unique morphologic and clinicopathologic features. Generally, ACD-RCC is regarded as an indolent tumor; however, prognostic and outcomes data have been conflicted by the limited and relatively low number of cases with patient follow-up or adverse events. In this study, we focused on the histology of metastatic lesions and identifying prognostic factors associated with metastatic progression. From 32 cases in the cohort, 9 patients had metastasis [ACD-RCC (M+)] and 23 patients were without metastasis [ACD-RCC (M-)]. The median age of patients was 52 years; right side, n=10; left side, n=18; bilateral, n=4; median tumor size=2.6\\u2009cm; median hemodialysis duration=17\\u2009y; and the median duration of follow-up was 50\\u2009mo. Immunohistochemistry showed ACD-RCC to be racemase positive and CK7 negative to focally positive within tumor cells, with consistent positivity for renal histogenesis-associated markers (PAX8 and RCC antigen); S100A1 was a less reliable marker at metastatic sites. All metastatic ACD-RCC except 2 cases involved lymph nodes (para-aortic, renal hilar, subclavicular). Overall, 6/9 (67%) had visceral metastasis to sites including lung (n=3), liver (n=3), bone (n=5), stomach (n=1), and brain (n=1). In total, 5/9 (56%) metastatic tumors had distinctive cystic growth pattern at the metastatic site; intriguingly metastatic tumors had intrametastatic oxalate crystal deposition, a pathognomonic feature associated with primary tumors. Four of nine (44%) patients with ACD-RCC (M+) had fatal outcomes due to metastatic disease. Clinically significant adverse prognostic features associated with metastasis [median follow-up 47\\u2009mo, ACD-RCC (M+) vs. ACD-RCC (M-), 50\\u2009mo] included: duration of hemodialysis (≥20 vs. <20\\u2009y, P=0.0085) and tumor necrosis (P=0.049). Because of sufficient overlap between these parameters, the study was not able to identify parameters that would be reliable in further management strategies, in clinical settings. Our data indicate that ACD-RCC is a tumor which has distinct metastatic potential with nodal and visceral tropism and proclivity for cystic morphology at metastatic sites; this is the first report of the presence of oxalate crystals in metastatic tumors. Our data suggest that ACD-RCC patients with prolonged hemodialysis and tumoral coagulative necrosis require additional surveillance in view of the association of these parameters with metastatic progression. To analyze the rule of acupoint selection for cancer pain based on data mining.\\nThe published literature regarding acupuncture for cancer pain in the recent 10 years was searched in PubMed, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang database. The acupoint selection was summarized and analyzed by TCMISS V2.5.\\nTotally 68 literature was collected and 73 acupoint prescriptions were included, involving 117 acupoints. These acupoints were mainly in bladder meridian, stomach meridian, liver meridian and spleen meridian. Among them, 40 acupoints used more than 4 times were identified, and the top three acupoints were Zusanli (ST 36, 65 times), Neiguan (PC 6, 55 times) and Taichong (LR 3, 50 times). A total of 68 acupoint combinations used more than 19 times were identified, and the top three acupoint combinations were Zusanli (ST 36)-Neiguan (PC 6), Taichong (LR 3)-Zusanli (ST 36) and Zusanli (ST 36)-Sanyinjiao (SP 6). There were 103 acupoint combinations with strong association; based on the entropy clustering algorithm, 20 new acupoint combinations and 10 new acupoint prescriptions were obtained.\\nThe main meridians for cancer pain are bladder meridian, stomach meridian, liver meridian and spleen meridian, with Zusanli (ST 36), Neiguan (PC 6), Taichong (LR 3), Hegu (LI 4), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and  Accurate identification of tumor sites and boundaries is of paramount importance during minimally invasive surgery. Although laparoscopic resection is being increasingly and widely performed for early gastric and colorectal cancers, the detection of tumors located inside the stomach and intestine is difficult owing to the lack of tactile sensation. Here, we propose the application of an indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded alginate hydrogel system as a fluorescence surgical marker for precise laparoscopic operations.\\nA physical complex of ICG and human serum albumin (HSA) was mixed with sodium alginate to form an injectable hydrogel system. Calcium carbonate and D-gluconic acid (GA) were added to the gel to control its strength and gelation time, respectively. The optimal conditions for the preparation of injectable hydrogels were determined by analyzing the fluorescence spectra and sol-gel transition time of the prepared samples at various concentrations and compositions. Next, the aqueous solutions of ICG, ICG-HSA, and ICG-HSA-loaded alginate were subcutaneously injected into nude mice (three mice per group), and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence images of the mice (λ\\nThe optimal concentration of ICG-HSA complex was determined to be 30 µM, and maximum fluorescence intensity of the complex was obtained at a 1:1 mole ratio of HSA to ICG. The subcutaneous injection of ICG or ICG-HSA solution in mice resulted in the rapid spread of the fluorescence signal around the injection site in 3 h, and a weak fluorescence was detected at the injection site 24 h post-injection. In contrast, the fluorescence detection time was effectively prolonged up to 96 h post-injection in the case of ICG-HSA-loaded alginate gel, while diffusion of the injected ICG from the injection site was effectively prevented. In the laparoscopic operation, injection sites of the hydrogel in porcine stomach could be accurately detected in real time even after 3 days.\\nThis alginate hydrogel system may be potentially useful as an effective surgical marker in terms of accuracy and persistence for laparoscopic operation. Proximal gastrectomy (PG) is a function-preserving surgery in cases of proximally located early-stage gastric cancer. Because gastroesophageal reflux is a major pitfall of this operation, we devised a modified esophagogastrostomy (EG) anastomosis to fix the distal part of the posterior esophageal wall to the proximal part of the anterior stomach wall to produce an anti-reflux mechanism; we named this the SPADE operation. This study aimed to show demonstrate the clinical outcomes of the SPADE operation and compare them to those of previous PG cases.\\nCase details of 56 patients who underwent PG between January 2012 and March 2018 were retrospectively reviewed: 30 underwent conventional esophagogastrostomy (CEG) anastomosis using a circular stapler, while 26 underwent the SPADE operation. Early postoperative clinical outcome-related reflux symptoms, endoscopic findings, and postoperative complications were compared in this case-control study.\\nFollow-up endoscopy showed more frequent reflux esophagitis cases in the CEG group than in the SPADE group (30% vs. 15.3%, P=0.19). Similarly, bile reflux (26.7% vs. 7.7%, P=0.08) and residual food (P=0.01) cases occurred more frequently in the CEG group than in the SPADE group. In the CEG group, 13 patients (43.3%) had mild reflux symptoms, while 3 patients (10%) had severe reflux symptoms. In the SPADE group, 3 patients (11.5%) had mild reflux symptoms, while 1 had severe reflux symptoms (absolute difference, 31.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-29.64; P=0.01).\\nA novel modified EG, the SPADE operation, has the potential to decrease gastroesophageal reflux following a PG. Gastrectomy with lymph node dissection remains the gold standard for curative treatment of gastric cancer. Dissection of splenic hilar lymph nodes has been included as a part of D2 lymph node dissection for proximal gastric cancer. Previously, pancreatico-splenectomy has been performed for dissecting splenic hilar lymph nodes, followed by pancreas-preserving splenectomy and spleen-preserving lymphadenectomy. However, the necessity of routine splenectomy or splenic hilar lymph node dissection has been under debate due to the increased morbidity caused by splenectomy and the poor prognostic feature of splenic hilar lymph node metastasis. In contrast, the relatively high incidence of splenic hilar lymph node metastasis, survival advantage, and therapeutic value of splenic hilar lymph node dissection in some patient subgroups, as well as the effective use of novel technologies, still supports the necessity and applicability of splenic hilar lymph node dissection. In this review, we aimed to evaluate the need for splenic hilar lymph node dissection and suggest the subgroup of patients with favorable outcomes. Peroxiredoxin IV (PRDX4) is a multifunctional protein that is involved in cell protection against oxidative injury, regulation of cell proliferation, modulation of intracellular signaling, and the pathogenesis of tumors. We previously conducted a proteomic analysis to investigate tumor-specific protein expression in gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PRDX4 could be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate PRDX4 as a prognostic marker for gastric cancer. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of PRDX4 expression in AGS cells and MKN28 cells was used for functional studies, and PRDX4 overexpression in PRDX4-depleted cells was used for knock-in studies. Based on immunohistochemistry data, TNM stage and PRDX4 were independent prognostic factors in the Cox proportional hazard model (P<0.05). In the survival analysis, the PRDX4-overexpressing group demonstrated significantly worse survival than the PRDX4-underexpression group (P<0.01).  Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) and pyloric gland adenoma (PGA) in the stomach are metaplastic and neoplastic lesions, respectively, in which gastric body glands are replaced by pyloric glands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genomic profile of SPEM and compare it with intestinal-type gastric cancer (GC) and PGA. Thirteen gastrectomies showing PGA with or without dysplasia, GC and SPEM were retrospectively selected. MUC5AC, MUC6, gastrin, and TFF2 IHC were performed. Lesions were subjected to laser capture microdissection followed by DNA extraction. Forty-three DNA samples were extracted from PGA without cytological dysplasia, PGA with low-grade and high-grade dysplasia and pyloric gland adenocarcinoma, GC, SPEM, and adjacent normal tissue from the body of the stomach and were subjected to exome sequencing for 49 genes that are commonly dysregulated in GC. Sanger sequencing was performed for confirmation. Twenty nonsynonymous mutations were identified in SPEM, and none of these were frameshifts or indels. PGA with or without cytological dysplasia showed a significantly higher number of mutations compared with SPEM. As cytological dysplasia increased from no dysplasia to dysplasia in PGA, the percentage of frameshift mutations, indels, and missense variations increased. Further missense or frameshift mutations were observed in the KRAS, APC, TP53, and CTNNB1 genes in the PGA group. In GC, mutations were observed in the TP53 gene (p.Arg248Gln). Missense mutations in the MUC5AC, KRAS, BRAF, and EZH2 genes were common between SPEM and GC. SPEM showed fewer genomic variations than GC and PGA, and was genomically distinct from the pyloric epithelium in PGA. Stepwise progression of PGA from PGA without dysplasia to PGA with dysplasia/adenocarcinoma was associated an increase in mutations. SPEM appears to be more genomically similar to GC than PGA. Hispanic/Latino patients have a higher incidence of gastric cancer and worse cancer-related outcomes compared with patients of other backgrounds. Whether there is a molecular basis for these disparities is unknown, as very few Hispanic/Latino patients have been included in previous studies. To determine the genomic landscape of gastric cancer in Hispanic/Latino patients, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on tumor samples from 57 patients; germline analysis was conducted on 83 patients. The results were compared with data from Asian and White patients published by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Hispanic/Latino patients had a significantly larger proportion of genomically stable subtype tumors compared with Asian and White patients (65% vs. 21% vs. 20%,  报道1例罕见胃EB病毒阳性淋巴上皮瘤样癌合并B淋巴细胞单克隆性增生，并复习相关文献。患者为男性75岁，胃底贲门见一溃疡型肿块。镜下观察：肿瘤以推挤性生长为主，侵及胃壁深肌层。肿瘤组织中淋巴上皮间质明显多于肿瘤细胞，肿瘤细胞间质淋巴细胞背景中部分为B淋巴细胞构成，周围可见淋巴上皮病变。EB病毒原位杂交显示：癌细胞阳性。分子病理显示B细胞IgH-DH克隆性基因重排。最终诊断为：胃EB病毒阳性淋巴上皮瘤样癌伴淋巴样间质内B细胞单克隆性增生。.  Information about stage of cancer at diagnosis, use of therapy, and survival among patients from different racial/ethnic groups with 1 of the most common cancers is lacking.\\nTo assess stage of cancer at diagnosis, use of therapy, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with cancer from different racial/ethnic groups.\\nThis cohort study included 950\\u202f377 Asian, black, white, and Hispanic patients who were diagnosed with prostate, ovarian, breast, stomach, pancreatic, lung, liver, esophageal, or colorectal cancers from January 2004 to December 2010. Data were collected using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and patients were observed for more than 5 years. Data analysis was conducted in July 2018.\\nMultivariable logistic and Cox regression were used to evaluate the differences in stage of cancer at diagnosis, treatment, and survival among patients from different racial/ethnic groups.\\nA total of 950\\u202f377 patients (499\\u202f070 [52.5%] men) were included in the study, with 681\\u202f251 white patients (71.7%; mean [SD] age, 65 [12] years), 116\\u202f015 black patients (12.2%; mean [SD] age, 62 [12] years), 65\\u202f718 Asian patients (6.9%; mean [SD] age, 63 [13] years), and 87\\u202f393 Hispanic patients (9.2%; mean [SD] age, 61 [13] years). Compared with Asian patients, black patients were more likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.144; 95% CI, 1.109-1.180; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to receive definitive treatment than Asian patients (black: adjusted OR, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.609-0.653; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; Hispanic: adjusted OR, 0.751; 95% CI, 0.724-0.780; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). White, black, and Hispanic patients were more likely to have poorer CSS and OS than Asian patients (CSS, white: adjusted HR, 1.310; 95% CI, 1.283-1.338; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; black: adjusted HR, 1.645; 95% CI, 1.605-1.685; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; Hispanic: adjusted HR, 1.300; 95% CI, 1.266-1.334; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; OS, white: adjusted HR, 1.333; 95% CI, 1.310-1.357; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; black: adjusted HR, 1.754; 95% CI, 1.719-1.789; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001; Hispanic: adjusted HR, 1.279; 95% CI, 1.269-1.326; P\\u2009<\\u2009.001).\\nIn this study of patients with 1 of 9 leading cancers, stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival were different by race and ethnicity. These findings may help to optimize treatment and improve outcomes. RNA-binding proteins have been associated with cancer development. The overexpression of a well-known RNA-binding protein, insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA-binding protein 3, has been identified as an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with various types of cancer. Although gastric cancer is a relatively frequent and potentially fatal malignancy, the mechanism by which insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA-binding protein 3 regulates the development of this cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA-binding protein 3 in gastric cancer. An analysis of  Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) is widely used for early gastric cancer located in the middle third of the stomach. The minimization of the extent of gastrectomy may increase the risk of metachronous multiple gastric cancer (MGC). We report the findings of a study that was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of MGC after PPG.\\nThe clinical data of 533 patients who underwent PPG for gastric cancer between 1993 and 2018 were reviewed. The clinicopathological characteristics at the time of the primary treatment that were predictive of the development of MGC were explored. The median (range) observation period was 112.4 (8.1-290.7) months.\\nMetachronous MGC was diagnosed in 33 of the 533 patients. The cumulative 5-year and 10-year event rates were 3.3% and 6.2%, respectively. The patient gender, presence/absence of synchronous MGC and the macroscopic type of the primary gastric cancer were significantly associated with the risk of development of metachronous MGC. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of synchronous MGC (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.828, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.611-12.30, p\\u2009=\\u20090.004) and Type 0-IIa primary gastric cancer (HR 2.810, 95% CI; 1.113-7.090, p\\u2009=\\u20090.029) as independent factors associated with the risk of development of MGC. All the patients could be treated by surgical or endoscopic resection for the metachronous MGC. Recurrence was observed in one patient.\\nThere was quite a few incidence of development of metachronous MGC after PPG. Nevertheless, PPG remains reasonable treatment option, if adequate postoperative surveillance can be ensured. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a treatment for early gastric neoplasms that preserves the stomach. However, the risk of multiple lesions persists.\\nTo assess clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with early gastric neoplasms in a Western country and evaluate risk factors for multiple gastric lesions, synchronous, or metachronous.\\nA retrospective cohort of 230 consecutive patients who underwent ESD for primary neoplasms from 2012 to 2017 (median follow-up: 33 months) was assessed to determine the clinicopathologic characteristics and risk factors for multiple lesions.\\nThe mean age was 68 years, and 53.9% were male. Current/former smoking status was present in 40.4%, and 29.5% had family history of gastric cancer. A third of the patients had only focal gastric atrophy/metaplasia (operative link on gastritis assessment/operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia assessment [OLGA/OLGIM] I/II; endoscopic grading of gastric intestinal metaplasia [EGGIM] 1-4). Synchronous and me-tachronous lesions occurred in 14.3 and 8.6% of patients, respectively. There was a trend for higher risk of multiple lesions in smokers and patients with extensive metaplasia (EGGIM >4), but only older age was an independent risk factor (OR 3.30; 95% CI 1.05-10.34). Age >60 years (OR 10.10, 95% CI 1.40-88.04), current/former smoking status (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.07-12.40), and OLGIM III/IV (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.01-9.36) were independent risk factors for synchronous lesions. No risk factors for metachronous lesions were found.\\nSurveillance limited to patients with advanced stages of gastritis may miss some primary superficial neoplasms. Although older age increases the risk of multiple lesions, no risk factors were found for metachronous lesions. Therefore, endoscopic surveillance after ESD should be done equally in all patients.\\nA dissecção endoscópica da submucosa (DES) é uma opção terapêutica para neoplasias gástricas em estadios iniciais e que permite preservar o estômago. No entanto, o risco de desenvolver lesões múltiplas mantém-se.\\nAvaliar as características clinicopatológicas dos pacientes com neoplasias gástricas superficiais primárias num país ocidental e avaliar os fatores de risco (FR) para lesões gástricas múltiplas, síncronas ou metácronas.\\nForam estudados, retrospetivamente, 230 doentes submetidos a DES por lesões gástricas primárias entre 2012 e 2017 (tempo de seguimento mediano: 33 meses). As características clínicopatológicas eos FR para lesões múltiplas foram analisados.\\nA idade média foi de 68 anos, 53,9% eram homens, 40,4% eram fumadores/ex-fumadores e 29,5% tinham história familiar de cancro gástrico. Um terço dos pacientes apresentava apenas atrofia/metaplasia focal (OLGA/OLGIM l/ll; EGGIM 1–4). Foram detetadas lesões síncronas em 14,3% e metácronas em 8,6% dos doentes. Para lesões gástricas múltiplas, tabagismo e metaplasia extensa (EGGIM<4) mostraram uma associação, mas apenas a idade avançada foi FR independente (Odds Ratio [OR] 3, 30; Intervalo de Confiança a 95% [IC 95%] 1, 05–10, 34). Idade superior a 60 anos (OR 10,10; IC95% 1,40–88,04), tabagismo (OR 3,64; IC95% 1,07–12,40) e OLGIM lll/IV (OR 3,07; IC95% 1,01–9,36) foram FR independentes para lesões síncronas. Não foram encontrados FR para lesões metácronas.\\nLimitar a vigilância aos pacientes com gastrite em estadios avançados não permite identificar todas as lesões neoplásicas precoces. A idade avançada aumenta o risco de lesões múltiplas, contudo não foi encontrado nenhum FR para lesões metácronas. Assim, a vigilância endoscópica após DES deve ser idêntica em todos os pacientes. To evaluate the expression of immune checkpoint genes, their concordance with expression of IFNγ, and to identify potential novel ICP related genes (ICPRG) in colorectal cancer (CRC), the biological connectivity of six well documented (\"classical\") ICPs (CTLA4, PD1, PDL1, Tim3, IDO1, and LAG3) with IFNγ and its co-expressed genes was examined by NGS in 79 CRC/healthy colon tissue pairs. Identification of novel IFNγ- induced molecules with potential ICP activity was also sought. In our study, the six classical ICPs were statistically upregulated and correlated with IFNγ, CD8A, CD8B, CD4, and 180 additional immunologically related genes in IFNγ positive (FPKM > 1) tumors. By ICP co-expression analysis, we also identified three IFNγ-induced genes [(IFNγ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (IFI30), guanylate binding protein1 (GBP1), and guanylate binding protein 4 (GBP4)] as potential novel ICPRGs. These three genes were upregulated in tumor compared to normal tissues in IFNγ positive tumors, co-expressed with CD8A and had relatively high abundance (average FPKM = 362, 51, and 25, respectively), compared to the abundance of the 5 well-defined ICPs (Tim3, LAG3, PDL1, CTLA4, PD1; average FPKM = 10, 9, 6, 6, and 2, respectively), although IDO1 is expressed at comparably high levels (FPKM = 39). We extended our evaluation by querying the TCGA database which revealed the commonality of IFNγ dependent expression of the three potential ICPRGs in 638 CRCs, 103 skin cutaneous melanomas (SKCM), 1105 breast cancers (BC), 184 esophageal cancers (ESC), 416 stomach cancers (STC), and 501 lung squamous carcinomas (LUSC). In terms of prognosis, based on Pathology Atlas data, correlation of GBP1 and GBP4, but not IFI30, with 5-year survival rate was favorable in CRC, BC, SKCM, and STC. Thus, further studies defining the role of IFI30, GBP1, and GBP4 in CRC are warranted. Preoperative imatinib mesylate therapy for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is controversial. This study aimed to explore the clinical efficacy and optimal duration of preoperative imatinib mesylate (IM) therapy in patients with locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic GISTs.\\nWe retrospectively examined patients who received preoperative imatinib mesylate therapy from January 2013 to December 2018 at Xiangya Hospital, Central South University and the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, China. Clinical data, including the results of tests for mutations in KIT and PDGFR, findings from regularly conducted re-examinations, abdominal-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data, responses to imatinib, progression-free survival, and overall cancer-specific survival, were recorded.\\nA total of 25 patients were enrolled in our study, including 18 with a locally advanced GIST and 7 with recurrent or metastatic GISTs. Their ages ranged from 22 to 70\\u2009years (M:F = 1.6:0.9), with a mean age of 50.48 ± 12.51\\u2009years. The tumor locations included the stomach (56.0%), rectum (16.0%), enterocoelic/retroperitoneal sites (12.0%), and the small intestine (12.0%). Based on testing for mutations in KIT and PDGFR, 22 patients received 400\\u2009mg/day KIT, and 3 patients received 600\\u2009mg/day PDGFR. The median duration of preoperative IM therapy was 8.96 ± 4.81\\u2009months, ranging from 3 to 26\\u2009months. According to the Choi criteria, 24 patients achieved a partial response (PR), and 1 patient had stable disease (SD). All patients underwent surgery after preoperative IM therapy, and no postoperative complications appeared. The 2-year PFS and 5-year PFS were 92% and 60%, respectively, and the total 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 92%.\\nPreoperative imatinib therapy is feasible for locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic GISTs and can effectively shrink the tumor size, allow organ sparing, and avoid extensive organ resection. Moreover, the optimal duration of preoperative IM therapy in patients with locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic GISTs was 8.96 ± 4.81\\u2009months, ranging from 3 to 26\\u2009months, and gastric GISTs had a better response to preoperative IM therapy than did non-gastric GISTs. Matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) plays multiple roles in extracellular proteolysis as well as intracellular transcription, prompting a new definition of moonlighting metalloproteinase (MMP), according to a definition of protein moonlighting (or gene sharing), a phenomenon by which a protein can perform more than one function. Indeed, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, aka cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2)) is transcriptionally induced as well as cleaved by MMP3. Moreover, several members of the MMP family have been found within tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). We here investigated the roles of MMP3-rich EVs in tumor progression, molecular transmission, and gene regulation. EVs derived from a rapidly metastatic cancer cell line (LuM1) were enriched in MMP3 and a C-terminal half fragment of CCN2/CTGF. MMP3-rich, LuM1-derived EVs were disseminated to multiple organs through body fluid and were pro-tumorigenic in an allograft mouse model, which prompted us to define LuM1-EVs as oncosomes in the present study. Oncosome-derived MMP3 was transferred into recipient cell nuclei and thereby trans-activated the  It has been preclinically and clinically proven that anticancer agent-incorporating (ACA-incorporating) polymeric micelles selectively accumulate in tumor via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, yielding a wider therapeutic window and greater safety than conventional low-molecular weight ACAs. To increase the antitumor effect of these safer micelle formulations, epirubicin-incorporating polymer micelles (NC-6300) conjugated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been prepared. In this study, we used two types of mAb: an anti-tissue factor (TF) mAb that does not exert a direct cytocidal effect, and an anti-HER2 mAb that has a direct cytocidal effect. We compared the antitumor effects and pharmacological properties of the two types of antibody conjugated to NC-6300. Immunomicelles conjugated to anti-TF mAb exerted greater antitumor activity toward TF-positive stomach cancer than the combination of anti-TF mAb and NC-6300, and were distributed more uniformly throughout TF-positive tumor tissue than NC-6300. On the other hand, immunomicelles conjugated to anti-HER2 mAb did not exert significant antitumor activity toward HER2-positive stomach cancer relative to the combined use of anti-HER2 mAb and NC-6300. Thus, this immunomicelle-based strategy may be useful for antibodies that target cancer as pilot molecules even when the antibodies themselves do not have an antitumor effect. The optimal standard reconstruction procedure after distal gastrectomy is controversial. No large-scale persuasive clinical studies from long-term perspectives on this topic have yet been conducted.\\nThis retrospective multicenter study analyzed a database of 2510 consecutive patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer who underwent distal gastrectomy followed by Billroth-I (B-I) or Roux-en-Y (R-Y) anastomosis from 2006 to 2012. After adjusting for 30 potential confounding factors using propensity score matching, we compared the body weight loss and other nutritional status for 5\\xa0years as primary outcomes between the two groups. We also investigated surgical outcomes, endoscopic findings, and long-term survival rates as secondary outcomes.\\nAfter matching the inclusion criteria, 940 patients (470 in each group) were enrolled. There was no marked difference in the body weight loss and other nutritional indicators. The incidence of grade ≥3 postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) or the incidence of gallstone formation was not markedly different between the two groups. The postoperative hospital stay after surgery was significantly longer, and the readmission rate was significantly higher in the R-Y group than in the B-I group. An endoscopic examination revealed no trends regarding the incidence and severity of gastritis or residual food in the remnant stomach. The 5-year overall survival rate was 92.6% in the B-I group and 91.8% in the R-Y group, with no significant difference (\\nRoux-en-Y reconstruction may be nearly equal to Billroth-I with regard to the long-term nutritional perspectives. Recent improvements in diagnostic techniques and national screening programs have resulted in increasing number of patients diagnosed with early gastric cancer (EGC). The low incidence rate of lymph node metastasis and excellent survival rates after surgical treatment for EGC enabled the reduction in the extent of lymphadenectomy and the range of gastric resection for function-preserving gastrectomy. Thus, the quality of life (QOL) of patients with gastric cancer (GC) in the curative stage can be maintained. Moreover, these function-preserving procedures have been widely performed by less invasive procedures, such as laparoscopic and robotic approaches. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) and proximal gastrectomy (PG) represent the two main function-preserving surgical procedures for GC. PPG is an alternative to distal gastrectomy (DG) for cT1 N0 EGC located in the middle part of the stomach. Preservation of the pyloric function is expected to prevent post-gastrectomy syndromes such as dumping syndrome. PG is an alternative to total gastrectomy (TG) and can thus be performed for cT1 N0 EGC located in the upper part of the stomach. Preservation of the residual stomach is expected to work as a reservoir for ingested food. The optimal reconstruction method after PG among the three most commonly performed procedures (esophagogastrostomy, jejunal interposition, and double-tract reconstruction) remains controversial. In addition to these three reconstruction methods, the novel double-flap technique (DFT) of esophagogastrostomy has gained attention recently because of its potential usefulness to prevent postoperative esophageal reflux. In this review article, we summarize the current evidence of PPG and PG with esophagogastrostomy by the DFT, focusing on postoperative nutrition and QOL. Over the past few years, the innovative field of magnifying endoscopy has been expanding with various cutting-edge technologies, one of which is endocytoscopy, to facilitate improvement in the detection and diagnosis of gastrointestinal lesions. Endocytoscopy is a novel ultra-high magnification endoscopic technique enabling high-quality  Throughout the world, there exists a clear need for the maintenance of cancer statistics, forming an essential part of any rational programme of cancer control, health-care planning, etiological research, primary and secondary prevention, benefiting both individuals and society. The present work reports only on the prevalence of cancers in the Oncology Department of Jamhuriyat Hospital, Kabul, Afghanistan following several decades of war.\\nA quantitative retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using the medical records of patients diagnosed and treated from October 2015 to December 2017. Data includes information on gender, age, economic status, address and types of cancer diagnosed. The data was transferred to a customized form and analysed using Microsoft Excel program to classify cancer types.\\nThe total number of patients with completed documents were 1025. Of these, 403 (39.3%) were male and 622 (60.7%) female. Most of the patients were in the age range of 20-70 years old. The most common cancers in women were breast cancer (45.8%), followed by oesophagus (12.5%), colorectal (4.8%), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (4.7%), sarcoma (4.7%), ovary (3.8%), both stomach and liver (2.6%) and cervix uteri (1.9%). Contrarily to men, esophageal cancer was highest (21.8%), followed by stomach (12.2%), Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (9.4%), sarcoma (8.9%), gastroesophageal junction (8.9%), colorectal (8.6%), Hodgkin lymphoma (4.7%), testis (4.2%), liver (3.2%), lung (2.7%) and Nonmelanoma skin squamous cell carcinoma 9 (2.2%).\\nResults showed that the most frequent cancers among Afghans were breast and oesophagus. The most common cancer in men was oesophagus and stomach at the age range of 50-70 years while in women, breast and oesophagus cancers were common and within the age range of 25-65 years old. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) is tested in many human cancers, including breast, bladder, pancreatic, ovarian and stomach. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) have issued Clinical Practice Guidelines for reporting Her2 results for breast carcinomas (Wolf et al., 2018). For the last 1-2\\u202fyears Her2/neu is tested in endometrial serous carcinoma, especially in recurrent tumors or non-responsive tumors as an option for additional treatment. College of American Pathologists (CAP) offers a template for prognostic marker reporting results for specimens with endometrial carcinomas (Fitzgibbons et al., 2019). Her2/neu testing by immunohistochemistry (IHC) mandates rigorous fixation time control, e.g., fixation time should fall within 6-72\\u202fh (Recommendations for Her2 Testing in Breast Cancer, 2013). For that reason, in breast cancers, Her2/neu testing is done on initial core biopsy specimens. The test is however, repeated on excision specimen in high grade tumors where Her2/neu expression was initially negative on core biopsies. For endometrial serous carcinoma no guidelines have been set or proposed as of yet. The Gynecologic Oncologists request this test because of proven benefit of adding Trastuzumab (Fader et al., 2018) and that is why it is important to documenting the findings in this report in the literature so that an informed request can be made by the treating oncologist when multiple tissue samples from the same patient are available for testing. Similarly pathologists also can decide which would be the best sample to test when no instruction is received. We report here three separate scenarios of uterine serous carcinomas in which the Her2/neu expressions were unique enough to justify documentation and therefore have implications for determining which specimen is ideal for the Her2 overexpression testing and likely to have highest possibility in identifying the Her2/neu overexpressed clone in the tumor which would expand the therapeutic options for the patients. None The aim of the present study was to examine the clinical characteristics of hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS) and its diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.\\nA retrospective analysis of 13 HAS cases was performed. The mean age of the 13 patients was 66.08 years, and 10 of the 13 patients were male. Prior to treatment, the alpha-fetoprotein levels in the serum were elevated in 7 patients, the tumour was located in the distal or gastric body in 11 patients, and the gastroscopy pathological results showed that 3 patients had poorly differentiated tumours and that 8 patients had moderately/poorly differentiated tumours. Abdominal CT scans showed local stomach wall thickening, and enlarged lymph nodes were visible around the stomach in 8 patients. Of the 13 patients, 11 underwent radical surgery. The clinical pathological staging was as follows: Stage II in 2 cases; stage III in 8 cases; and stage IV in 1 case. A total of 3 patients were lost to follow-up. Otherwise, as of the last follow-up, 3 patients had survived for 56 mo, and the other 7 patients failed to achieve long-term survival (survival period of 1-56 mo).\\nHAS is a special type of gastric cancer, and the prognosis of HAS has improved compared with past prognoses. Measurement of alpha-fetoprotein, early diagnosis, active surgical treatment, and application of new diagnostic and treatment techniques are conducive to improving the prognosis of HAS. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and ICOS-L (also referred to as B7 homolog 1 and 2, respectively) modulate the immune inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression levels of these inflammatory mediators in two groups of patients with an  Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infects 90%-95% of all adults globally and causes\\u2009~\\u20091% of all cancers. Differing proportions of Burkitt\\'s lymphoma (BL), gastric carcinoma (GC), Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma (HL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are associated with EBV. We sought to systematically review the global epidemiological evidence for risk factors that (in addition to EBV) contribute to the development of the EBV-associated forms of these cancers, assess the quality of the evidence, and compare and contrast the cancers.\\nMEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched for studies of risk factors for EBV-associated BL, GC, HL and NPC without language or temporal restrictions. Studies were excluded if there was no cancer-free comparator group or where analyses of risk factors were inadequately documented. After screening and reference list searching, data were extracted into standardised spreadsheets and quality assessed. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was undertaken.\\n9916 hits were retrieved. 271 papers were retained: two BL, 24 HL, one GC and 244 NPC. The majority of studies were from China, North America and Western Europe. Risk factors were categorised as dietary, environmental/non-dietary, human genetic, and infection and clinical. Anti-EBV antibody load was associated with EBV-associated GC and BL. Although the evidence could be inconsistent, HLA-A alleles, smoking, infectious mononucleosis and potentially other infections were risk factors for EBV-associated HL. Rancid dairy products; anti-EBV antibody and EBV DNA load; history of chronic ear, nose and/or throat conditions; herbal medicine use; family history; and human genetics were risk factors for NPC. Fresh fruit and vegetable and tea consumption may be protective against NPC.\\nMany epidemiological studies of risk factors in addition to EBV for the EBV-associated forms of BL, GC, HL and NPC have been undertaken, but there is a dearth of evidence for GC and BL. Available evidence is of variable quality. The aetiology of EBV-associated cancers likely results from a complex intersection of genetic, clinical, environmental and dietary factors, which is difficult to assess with observational studies. Large, carefully designed, studies need to be strategically undertaken to harmonise and clarify the evidence.\\nPROSPERO CRD42017059806. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a genomic property of the cancers with defective DNA mismatch repair and is a useful marker for cancer diagnosis and treatment in diverse cancer types. In particular, MSI has been associated with the active immune checkpoint blockade therapy response in cancer. Most of computational methods for predicting MSI are based on DNA sequencing data and a few are based on mRNA expression data. Using the RNA-Seq pan-cancer datasets for three cancer cohorts (colon, gastric, and endometrial cancers) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, we developed an algorithm (PreMSIm) for predicting MSI from the expression profiling of a 15-gene panel in cancer. We demonstrated that PreMSIm had high prediction performance in predicting MSI in most cases using both RNA-Seq and microarray gene expression datasets. Moreover, PreMSIm displayed superior or comparable performance versus other DNA or mRNA-based methods. We conclude that PreMSIm has the potential to provide an alternative approach for identifying MSI in cancer. Identification of microbial composition directly from tumor tissue permits studying the relationship between microbial changes and cancer pathogenesis. We interrogated bacterial presence in tumor and adjacent normal tissue strictly in pairs utilizing human whole exome sequencing to generate microbial profiles. Profiles were generated for 813 cases from stomach, liver, colon, rectal, lung, head & neck, cervical and bladder TCGA cohorts. Core microbiota examination revealed twelve taxa to be common across the nine cancer types at all classification levels. Paired analyses demonstrated significant differences in bacterial shifts between tumor and adjacent normal tissue across stomach, colon, lung squamous cell, and head & neck cohorts, whereas little or no differences were evident in liver, rectal, lung adenocarcinoma, cervical and bladder cancer cohorts in adjusted models.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is now widely used in gastric cancer patients. However, the current 8th ypTNM staging system is developed based on patients with less extensive lymph node dissection and the predictive value is relatively limited. In this study, we aim to develop and validate a nomogram that predicts overall survival in gastric cancer patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nFrom January, 2007 to December, 2014, 471 patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our center were enrolled in the study. Based on the Cox proportional hazard model, a nomogram was developed from them and then an external validation was conducted on a cohort of 239 patients from another cancer center.\\nThe overall survival (OS) rates of 1 year and 3 years were 90.0% and 64.1%, respectively. Body mass index category, tumor location, T stage and N stage were independent prognostic factors for the survival outcome. The C-index of the model was 0.74 in the development cohort and 0.69 in the validation cohort. Our nomogram also showed good calibration in both cohorts.\\nWe developed and validated a nomogram to predict the 1- and 3-year OS of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection. This nomogram predicts survival more accurately than the AJCC TNM staging system, which is the current golden standard. A 12-year-old Maltese dog was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Konkuk University because of severe regurgitation. Radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography showed a mass in the thoracic esophagus. Localization of the tumor, its extraluminal nature, the positioning and involvement of the stomach, and the lack of diffuse metastasis to the lung were factors considered when developing a surgical plan. A successful surgical procedure was performed. The final diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma. Following surgery, clinical signs were significantly reduced and postoperative complications were not observed. The dog died 25 days after surgery; we suspected that the death was due to postoperative stricture. Key clinical message: Surgical approaches that prioritize maintenance of low tension on the thoracic esophagus are important to prevent arrhythmia, bradycardia, and ventricular premature complex during esophagogastric anastomosis. In dogs with a small esophageal lumen anastomosis may lead to postoperative stricture. Gastric carcinoma is not commonly reported in dogs. There is an increased risk, however, in certain breeds such as the Belgian Tervuren. Review of the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB) established an increase in risk for gastric carcinoma in the chow chow breed. In 106 chow chow dogs signs commenced, on average, 3 weeks before definitive diagnosis. The most common clinical signs were vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and melena. Most affected dogs were euthanized, without treatment, within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Two dogs which were treated aggressively (surgery and chemotherapy) survived a considerably longer time (12 and 36 months). Histologically, these chow chow dogs comprised a similar histologic type as familial gastric carcinoma in humans; diffuse-type carcinoma that was enriched in the signet ring and mucinous variants. Understanding the pathogenesis of diffuse gastric carcinoma in the chow chow dog may provide insight into the biology of this aggressive cancer in humans. Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) are, so far, the best preclinical model to validate targets and predictors of response to therapy. While subcutaneous implantation very rarely allows metastatic dissemination, orthotopic implantation (Patient-Derived Orthotopic Xenograft-PDOX) increases metastatic capability. Using a modified tool to analyze model validity, we performed a systematic review of Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science up to December 2018 to identify all original publications describing gastric cancer (GC) PDOXs. We identified ten studies of PDOX model validation from January 1981 to December 2018 that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most models (70%) were derived from human GC cell lines rather than tissue fragments. In 90% of studies, the implantation was performed in the subserosal layer. Tumour engraftment rate ranged from 0 to 100%, despite the technique. Metastases were observed in 40% of PDOX models implanted into the subserosal layer, employing either cell suspension or cell line-derived tumour fragments. According to our modified model validity tool, half of the studies were defined as unclear because one or more validation criteria were not reported. Available GC PDOX models are not adequate according to our model validity tool. There is no demonstration that the submucosal site is more effective than the subserosal layer, and that tissue fragments are better than cell suspensions for successful engraftment and metastatic spread. Further studies should strictly employ model validity tools and large samples with orthotopic implant sites mirroring as much as possible the donor tumour characteristics. It has been an established fact that exosomes act as a mediator in tumor microenvironment as well as participate actively in intercellular communication between cancer cells. Exosomes carry a variety of molecular cargoes that prevent cyclic degradation and represent the cells of their origin. In this study, the difference in expression levels of exosomes was measured for diagnosis of gastric cancer. We isolated exosomes from plasma by size-selective method. The morphology of the exosomes was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, and the particle size and concentration of the exosomes were detected by NanoSight\\'s Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. Results indicated that the expression level of exosomes in gastric cancer patients was higher than that in healthy individuals. The specificity and sensitivity were 65.2% and 73.1%, respectively. Currently, clinical tumor markers for gastric cancer detection mainly included Carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA72-4), Alpha-fetoprotein, Carbohydrate antigen 125, Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), Carcinoembryonic Antigen, Carbohydrate antigen 242. When we combined positive rate for combined gastric cancer biomarkers, results showed that exosomes concentration +CA19-9 and exosomes concentration +CA72-4 in the two-combined test can provide enough positive rate. Therefore, it can be concluded that for gastric cancer, the concentration of exosomes may be regarded as a diagnostic indicator, eventually. CD44v6-containing isoforms are frequently de novo expressed in gastric cancer (GC). Whether CD44v6 has a central role in GC transformation and/or progression, whether it conditions response to therapy or whether it is only a bystander marker is still not known. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the role of CD44v6 in GC. We generated GC isogenic cell lines stably expressing CD44s or CD44v6 and tested them for different cancer hallmarks and response to cisplatin, and we further confirmed our findings in cells that endogenously express CD44v6. No correlation between overexpression of CD44v6 and the tested cancer hallmarks was observed, suggesting CD44v6 is not a driver of GC progression. Upon cisplatin treatment, CD44v6+ cells survive better and have lower apoptosis levels than CD44v6- cells, possibly due to concomitant activation of STAT3 and P38. In co-culture experiments, we discovered that CD44v6+ cells are involved in GC cell overgrowth after cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, we show that CD44v6 expression increases cell survival in response to cisplatin treatment in GC cells and that these cells override CD44v6-negative cells after cisplatin-treatment. This suggests that tumor expression of CD44v6-containing variants may condition the outcome of GC patients treated with chemotherapy. None Infection with the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori remains the most important modifiable risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. How the interactions between H. pylori and its host shape the gastric environment during chronic infection warrants further investigation. In this issue of the JCI, Palrasu et al. used human cell lines and mouse models to provide mechanistic insight into H. pylori\\'s ability to delay apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells by actively driving the degradation of a proapoptotic factor, SIVA1. Their findings suggest that promoting the survival of gastric epithelial cells has implications not only for H. pylori pathogenesis but for host tumorigenesis. Approximately half of the world\\'s population is infected with the stomach pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Infection with H. pylori is the main risk factor for distal gastric cancer. Bacterial virulence factors, such as the oncoprotein CagA, augment cancer risk. Yet despite high infection rates, only a fraction of H. pylori-infected individuals develop gastric cancer. This raises the question of defining the specific host and bacterial factors responsible for gastric tumorigenesis. To investigate the tumorigenic determinants, we analyzed gastric tissues from human subjects and animals infected with H. pylori bacteria harboring different CagA status. For laboratory studies, well-defined H. pylori strain B128 and its cancerogenic derivative strain 7.13, as well as various bacterial isogenic mutants were employed. We found that H. pylori compromises key tumor suppressor mechanisms: the host stress and apoptotic responses. Our studies showed that CagA induces phosphorylation of XIAP E3 ubiquitin ligase, which enhances ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the host proapoptotic factor Siva1. This process is mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. Inhibition of Siva1 by H. pylori increases survival of human cells with damaged DNA. It occurs in a strain-specific manner and is associated with the ability to induce gastric tumor. To determine whether radiomics features based on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) can preoperatively predict lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and clinical outcome in gastric cancer (GC) patients.\\nIn total, 160 surgically resected patients were retrospectively analyzed, and seven predictive models were constructed. Three radiomics predictive models were built from radiomics features based on arterial (A), venous (V) and combination of two phase (A\\u2009+\\u2009V) images. Then, three Radscores (A-Radscore, V-Radscore and A\\u2009+\\u2009V-Radscore) were obtained. Another four predictive models were constructed by the three Radscores and clinical risk factors through multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram was developed to predict LVI by incorporating A\\u2009+\\u2009V-Radscore and clinical risk factors. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test were utilized to analyze the outcome of LVI.\\nRadiomics related to tumor size and intratumoral inhomogeneity were the top-ranked LVI predicting features. The related Radscores showed significant differences according to LVI status (P\\u2009<\\u20090.01). Univariate logistic analysis identified three clinical features (T stage, N stage and AJCC stage) and three Radscores as LVI predictive factors. The Clinical-Radscore (namely, A\\u2009+\\u2009V\\u2009+\\u2009C) model that used all these factors showed a higher performance (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.856) than the clinical (namely, C, including T stage, N stage and AJCC stage) model (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.810) and the A\\u2009+\\u2009V-Radscore model (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.795) in the train cohort. For patients without LVI and with LVI, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.5 and 8.0\\u2009months (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001),and the median OS was 20.2 and 17.0\\u2009months (P\\u2009=\\u20090.3), respectively. In the Clinical-Radscore-predicted LVI absent and LVI present groups, the median PFS was 11.0 and 8.0\\u2009months (P\\u2009=\\u20090.03), and the median OS was 20.0 and 18.0\\u2009months (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05), respectively. N stage, LVI status and Clinical-Radscore-predicted LVI status were associated with disease-specific recurrence or mortality.\\nRadiomics features based on CECT may serve as potential markers to successfully predict LVI and PFS, but no evidence was found that these features were related to OS. Considering that it is a single central study, multi-center validation studies will be required in the future to verify its clinical feasibility. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) TP73 antisense RNA 1 (TP73-AS1) has been characterized as an oncogenic lncRNA in GC. However, by analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset we observed the downregulation of TP73-AS1 in GC. In addition, TP73-AS1 is predicted to interact with microRNA-223-5p (miR-223-5p), which is also a critical player in cancer biology. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the roles of miR-223-5p and TP73-AS1 in gastric cancer (GC) and to explore the interactions between them. In this study, 68 GC patients were included as research subjects. Expression of miR-223-5p and TP73-AS1 was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Dual-luciferase assay and overexpression experiments were used to analyze gene interactions. Transwell assays were used to analyze cell invasion and migration. We found that miR-223-5p was upregulated and TP73-AS1 was downregulated in GC and they were inversely correlated. Altered miR-223-5p and TP73-AS1 expression predicted poor disease-specific survival. Dual-luciferase assay showed that miR-223-5p may bind TP73-AS1 and overexpression experiments showed that miR-223-5p overexpression downregulated TP73-AS1 in gastric cancer cells. Cell invasion and migration assays showed that miR-223-5p could promote the invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells, while TP73-AS1 could inhibit the invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells. In addition, miR-223-5p attenuated the effects of TP73-AS1 overexpression. Therefore, miR-223-5p may target TP73-AS1 to promote the invasion and migration of gastric cancer patients. Gastric cancer (GC) represents the fifth cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Molecular biology has become a central area of research in GC and there are currently at least three major classifications available to elucidate the mechanisms that drive GC oncogenesis. Further, tumor microenvironment seems to play a crucial role, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are emerging as key players in GC development. TAMs are cells derived from circulating chemokine- receptor-type 2 (CCR2) inflammatory monocytes in blood and can be divided into two main types, M1 and M2 TAMs. M2 TAMs play an important role in tumor progression, promoting a pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive signal in the tumor. The diffuse GC subtype, in particular, seems to be strongly characterized by an immuno-suppressive and pro-angiogenic phenotype. No molecular targets in this subgroup have yet been identified. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular pathways and tumor microenvironment features in the GC molecular subtypes. The role of anti-angiogenics and checkpoint inhibitors has recently been clinically validated in GC. Both ramucirumab, a fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) antibody, and checkpoint inhibitors in Epstein Bar Virus (EBV) and Microsatellite Instable (MSI) subtypes, have proved beneficial in advanced GC. Nevertheless, there is a need to identify predictive markers of response to anti-angiogenics and immunotherapy in clinical practice for a personalized treatment approach. The importance of M2 TAMs in development of solid tumors is currently gaining increasing interest. In this literature review we analyze immune microenvironment composition and signaling related to M1 and M2 TAMs in GC as well as its potential role as a therapeutic target. There were an estimated 4.8 million new cases of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers and 3.4 million related deaths, worldwide, in 2018. GI cancers account for 26% of the global cancer incidence and 35% of all cancer-related deaths. We investigated the global burden from the 5 major GI cancers, as well as geographic and temporal trends in cancer-specific incidence and mortality.\\nData on primary cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colorectum, liver, and pancreas were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database for the year 2018, as well as from the Cancer Incidence in 5 Continents series, and the World Health Organization mortality database from 1960 onward. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex, country, and level of human development.\\nWe observed geographic and temporal variations in incidence and mortality for all 5 types of GI cancers. Esophageal, gastric, and liver cancers were more common in Asia than in other parts of the world, and the burden from colorectal and pancreatic cancers was highest in Europe and North America. There was a uniform decrease in gastric cancer incidence, but an increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in formerly low-incidence regions during the studied time period. We found slight increases in incidence of liver and pancreatic cancer in some high-income regions.\\nAlthough the incidence of some GI cancer types has decreased, this group of malignancies continues to pose major challenges to public health. Primary and secondary prevention measures are important for controlling these malignancies-most importantly reducing consumption of tobacco and alcohol, obesity control, immunizing populations against hepatitis B virus infection, and screening for colorectal cancer. We aimed to compare the computed tomography (CT) imaging differences between gastric and intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).\\nThirty-eight patients with 38 gastric GISTs and 27 with 31 intestinal GISTs were enrolled. Tumors were classified as small (<\\u20095\\xa0cm) or large (≥\\u20095\\xa0cm). Qualitative and quantitative CT imaging characteristics on non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT were evaluated by two radiologists independently and statistically compared.\\nEarly venous return and higher CT number of the draining vein in the arterial phase were more frequent in small-sized intestinal GISTs than in small-sized gastric GISTs (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Small-sized intestinal GISTs demonstrated a wash-out pattern, whereas small-sized gastric GISTs showed a plateau pattern. Contrast enhancement was higher in small-sized intestinal GISTs than in small-sized gastric GISTs (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). CT number was inversely proportional to the diameter of intestinal GISTs in both arterial and venous phases but not to that of gastric GISTs.\\nStrong enhancement with wash-out pattern and early venous return are characteristic findings of small-sized intestinal GISTs. Radiologists should be aware that CT findings of GISTs have a wide spectrum and may differ according to size and site of origin. We aimed to investigate the usefulness of near-infrared indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced fluorescence guidance for infrapyloric LN dissection in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.\\nThis study enrolled patients with early gastric cancer scheduled for laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. After intraoperative submucosal injection of ICG (0.1\\xa0mg/mL), LN dissection was conducted under near-infrared ICG fluorescence guidance. The operation time, bleeding events during infrapyloric LN dissection were analyzed. Cases were retrospectively 1:3 propensity-score matched to patients who underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy without ICG injection.\\nThe mean time from midline omentectomy to exposure of the right gastroepiploic vein was significantly shorter in the ICG group (n\\u2009=\\u200920) than in the non-ICG group (n\\u2009=\\u200960) (13.05\\u2009±\\u20095.77 vs 18.68\\u2009±\\u20097.92\\xa0min; p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), and the incidence of bleeding during infrapyloric LN dissection was lower in the ICG group (20% vs 68.3%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The two groups did not differ significantly regarding the number of LNs retrieved from the infrapyloric area (p\\u2009=\\u20090.434).\\nNear-infrared ICG fluorescence guidance facilitates safe and fast infrapyloric LN dissection in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is a disease of older adults and is dominated by  Cellular metabolism plays important functions in dictating stem cell behaviors, although its role in stomach epithelial homeostasis has not been evaluated in depth. Here, we show that the energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) governs gastric epithelial progenitor differentiation. Administering the AMPK activator metformin decreases epithelial progenitor proliferation and increases acid-secreting parietal cells (PCs) in mice and organoids. AMPK activation targets Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), known to govern progenitor proliferation and PC fate choice, and PGC1α, which we show controls PC maturation after their specification. PC-specific deletion of AMPKα or PGC1α causes defective PC maturation, which could not be rescued by metformin. However, metformin treatment still increases KLF4 levels and suppresses progenitor proliferation. Thus, AMPK activates KLF4 in progenitors to reduce self-renewal and promote PC fate, whereas AMPK-PGC1α activation within the PC lineage promotes maturation, providing a potential suggestion for why metformin increases acid secretion and reduces gastric cancer risk in humans. Gastric cancer represents the fifth most common malignancy and third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. There are two major types of gastric carcinoma: enteric type and diffuse type. Diffuse type gastric cancer is frequently associated with the mutations in E-cadherin coding gene CDH1. In cases of CDH1 mutations complete gastrectomy is indicated. CDH1 mutations are reflected with CDH1 protein loss by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between CDH1 mutations and other markers of tumour aggressiveness, such as tumour proliferation index and the presence of p53 mutations and Her2 amplification is not well studied. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse the correlation between CDH1 loss and the expression of Ki67 proliferation marker, mutant oncoprotein p53 and Her2. Standard immunohistochemistry was used to detect the following antigens: CDH1 (MCH-38, Invitrogen), Ki67 (EP5, Bio SB), p53 (DO-7, Leica) and Her2 (EP3, Bio SB). The study results showed that CDH1 mutations, reflected with CDH1 protein loss by immunohistochemistry are detected in 40% of diffuse gastric carcinomas, whilst it is not detected in enteric type gastric carcinomas. Diffuse gastric carcinomas with CDH1 mutations are characterised with more aggressive phenotype, particularly with the presence of higher Ki67 labelling index, p53 mutations and the presence of Her2 positivity. In cases of histological diagnosis of diffuse gastric carcinoma CDH1 testing is recommended. Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is known to be related to various types of cancer and is considered a novel tumor marker or therapeutic target. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical implications of NRP-1 expression in terms of prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. A total of 265 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy for the treatment of gastric cancer from 2008 to 2011 were included in this retrospective study. NRP-1 expression of tumors was determined by immunohistochemistry. The patients\\' clinicopathological characteristics, operative details, and long-term outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 181 (68.3%) patients demonstrated expression of NRP-1. No survival difference was observed according to NRP-1 expression in any patient. The patients were divided into the gland formation (GF) and the no gland formation (nGF) types, according to histology. NRP-1 expression rates were 65.6% (84/128) and 70.8% (97/137), respectively. NRP-1 expression was not an independent prognostic factor in the GF group, although patients who expressed NRP-1 had better survival outcomes. In contrast, patients who expressed NRP-1 in the nGF group had worse 5-year survival rates (p\\u2009=\\u20090.027), and NRP-1 was an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.923; 95% confidence interval, 1.041-3.551). NRP-1 expression in patients with nGF type gastric cancer is predictive of a poor prognosis. Currently, numerous studies indicate that circular RNA (circRNA) is associated with various human complex diseases. While identifying disease-related circRNAs in vivo is time- and labor-consuming, a feasible and effective computational method to predict circRNA-disease associations is worthy of more studies.\\nHere, we present a new method called SIMCCDA (Speedup Inductive Matrix Completion for CircRNA-Disease Associations prediction) to predict circRNA-disease associations. Based on known circRNA-disease associations, circRNA sequence similarity, disease semantic similarity, and the computed Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, we used speedup inductive matrix completion to construct the model. The proposed SIMCCDA method obtains an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.8465 with leave-one-out cross validation in the dataset, which is obtained by the combination of the three databases (circRNA disease, circ2Disease and circR2Disease). Our method surpasses other state-of-art models in predicting circRNA-disease associations. Furthermore, we conducted case studies in breast cancer, stomach cancer and colorectal cancer for further performance evaluation.\\nAll the results show reliable prediction ability of SIMCCDA. We anticipate that SIMCCDA could be utilized to facilitate further developments in the field and follow-up investigations by biomedical researchers. Aggregation of all Black populations in US cancer mortality profiles masks remarkable heterogeneity by place of birth. Comparing U.S-born African Americans with African and Afro-Caribbean immigrants may highlight specific cancer prevention and control needs and clarify global cancer epidemiology. Such a comparison has yet to be undertaken on a population basis.\\nUsing 2012-2017 vital statistics data from California, Florida, Minnesota and New York, age-standardized cancer mortality rates were computed for distinct Black populations. Comparisons were made to the majority White population using mortality rate ratios (MRR) obtained from negative binomial regression.\\nOf the 83,460 cancer deaths analyzed among Blacks, nearly 20 % were immigrants. African males and females had the lowest all-sites-combined cancer mortality rates (121 and 99 per 100,000, respectively), African Americans had the highest (232 and 163), while Afro-Caribbean were in between (140 and 106 respectively). The average Black:White MRR was significant for prostate (2.11), endometrial (2.05), stomach (2.02), multiple myeloma (1.87), premenopausal breast (1.66), liver (1.58) and cervical (1.56) cancers, (P < 0.05).\\nWhile, in aggregate, Blacks in the US have high cancer mortality rates, race itself is not the primary determinant of these disparities. Black immigrant populations show lower cancer mortality than both African Americans and Whites, especially for cancers where environmental factors feature more predominantly: lung, colorectal and breast. Even for cancers with high mortality among all African-descent groups, this study suggests a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Endometrial cancer was unique; mortality rates were similarly high for all three analyzed Black groups. Rab1A, a member of the Ras-like protein in rat brain (Rab) family, acts as an oncogene in a variety of malignant tumors. Previous studies reported that Rab1A was highly expressed in GC tissues. However, the function and molecular mechanism of Rab1A in gastric cancer (GC) development remain far from being addressed. Rab1A mRNA and protein levels were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 and BrdU incorporation assays. Apoptosis was estimated by flow cytometry analysis and western blot analysis of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) expression. Alteration of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway was detected by western blot. We found that Rab1A expression at both mRNA and protein was upregulated in GC cells. Rab1A knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in GC cells. Rab1A overexpression promoted proliferation, inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and increased xenograft growth. In addition, we found that Rab1A knockdown suppressed the mTOR/p70S6K pathway in GC cells. Moreover, activation of mTOR/p70S6K pathway by MHY1485 abolished the effects of Rab1A knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, Rab1A knockdown repressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis in GC cells by inhibition of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Several factors are known to be significantly associated with a low completion rate of 1-year adjuvant S-1 monotherapy for gastric cancer. The present study investigated whether or not the specialties of physicians conducting adjuvant S-1 monotherapy affect the completion rate.\\nA total of 437 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy followed by adjuvant S-1 monotherapy for pathological stage II or III gastric cancer between 2008 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Factors affecting completion of adjuvant S-1 monotherapy, including the physicians (medical oncologists or surgeons) administering S-1, were evaluated by a multivariate analysis. The relationship between patient factors and physicians was analyzed regarding the cumulative incidence of discontinuation. The number of times the dose was reduced, the schedule changed, or administration was suspended or delayed in patients completing adjuvant S-1 monotherapy was also counted.\\nThe multivariate analysis showed that old age (≥\\u200965\\xa0years old), excess body weight loss (≥\\u200915%), and surgeons were independently associated with discontinuation. In older patients, the cumulative incidence of discontinuation by medical oncologists was significantly lower than that by surgeons. Medical oncologists ensured that older patients continued S-1 by frequent suspension or a delay in each course.\\nMedical oncologists may facilitate completion of adjuvant S-1 monotherapy. Incisura angularis is one of the important parts for evaluating mucosal atrophy and cancer risk. We determined the type of mucosa at incisura angularis in Helicobacter pylori-naïve normal stomach.\\nSubjects aged 40\\xa0years or older who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for dyspepsia or a routine health checkup were recruited in 24 facilities between March 2008 and February 2009. Serum antibody to H. pylori was measured. Endoscopic atrophy was evaluated according to Updated Kimura-Takemoto classification. Five biopsy specimens were taken from the incisura angularis and greater and lesser curvatures of the antrum and corpus. These specimens were histologically classified as fundic, pyloric or transitional. H.\\xa0pylori-naïve normal stomach was defined with the strictest criterion among various combinations of histological, endoscopic and serum findings. We determined histological type of mucosa at incisura angularis in H.\\xa0pylori-naïve normal stomach.\\nA total of 270 subjects (122 men, mean 64.6\\xa0yo) were analyzed. The strictest criterion consists of serum antibody\\xa0≤\\xa03.0\\xa0U/mL, endoscopic atrophy C-1 and histological grade 0 in all of the five items in Updated Sydney System. The numbers having fundic, transitional and pyloric mucosa at incisura angularis under the strictest criterion were 13 (50%), 13 (50%) and 0, respectively. The probability that the type of mucosa at incisura angularis would be pyloric was almost zero (97.5% confidence interval 0-0.132).\\nIncisura angularis of the stomach may not belong to pyloric, but fundic or transitional mucosa in H.\\xa0pylori-naïve normal stomach. UMIN000018218. A 67-year-old woman who had undergone laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer 10 months previously was admitted to our hospital due to dysarthria. Brain MRI demonstrated acute multiple small infarcts in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory, and she was diagnosed as embolic stroke. Anticoagulant therapy did not prevent further ischemic stroke. No embolic sources were detected by MR angiography, carotid duplex sonography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, and Holter electrocardiography. We also performed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and contrast-enhanced CT of the thoracoabdominal area, but there was no evidence of local recurrence or lymph node metastases of gastric cancer. As the ALP and D-dimer levels were gradually increasing, we performed PET/CT, which revealed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the vertebra bone, and disseminated carcinomatosis of bone marrow with early gastric cancer was diagnosed after bone marrow biopsy on Day 41. After undergoing chemotherapy, she had no further stroke and died on Day 207. In order to explore the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) syndromes and medications in patients with colonic malignant tumors in China, the clinical data of patients with colonic malignant tumors from the information system of 33 Grade-A tertiary hospitals in China from 2001 to 2016 were extracted and a descriptive analysis was conducted on their disease characteristics, syndrome distribution, drug characteristics and treatment status. A total of 22 691 patients with colonic malignancies nationwide were included in the analysis, with male to female ratio of 1.59∶1, median age of 62 years, susceptible age of 50-79 years. Postoperative patients with colonic malignant tumors accounted for 47.10%, and patients with liver metastases reached 36.02%. Among the 520 patients with colonic malignant tumors, the top three TCM syndromes were: spleen deficiency syndrome(21%), Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome(17%) and liver and stomach disharmony syndrome(15%). The most frequently used Western medicine for patients with colonic malignant tumors was anti-metabolite cytotoxicity(61.23%), most frequently used in combination with platinum-based cytotoxic drugs(support degree 42.40%).The top three Western medicines were oxaliplatin(42.26%), leucovorin injection(38.58%) and dexamethasone(34.67%). The most frequently used traditional Chinese medicine type was heat-clearing and detoxifying drugs(39.59%), most frequently used in combination with Qi replenishing and body resistance strengthening drugs(support degree 12.72%). The top three traditional Chinese medicines were compound Kushen Injection(14.62%), Shenqi Fuzheng Injection(10.18%) and Aidi Injection(6.48%). This study shows that spleen and Qi deficiency may be the dominant syndrome of colonic malignant tumor, and chemotherapy is one of the main treatment methods. Traditional Chinese medicine has shown unique advantages in alleviating the toxic and side effects of chemotherapy and preventing recurrence and metastasis, so integrated TCM and Western medicine can significantly improve the clinical efficacy. Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG) is a function-preserving surgery performed on patients with cancer of the upper third of the stomach. However, if much of the ingested food passes through the jejunum, LPG might function broadly like a total gastrectomy. We devised a jejunogastrostomy with double-tract reconstruction (DTR) to ensure that most food flows easily to the remnant stomach.\\nA side-to-side jejunogastrostomy was created between the remnant stomach\\'s posterior wall and the jejunum 10\\xa0cm below the esophagojejunostomy, and the common stab incision was also closed with a linear stapler. The jejunogastrostomy was created as a delta-shaped anastomosis by using only linear staplers. The 15 patients who underwent delta-shaped anastomosis from 2017 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed to collect and analyze their surgical and postoperative outcomes, including nutritive conditions, in comparison to the reconstruction that was performed before then.\\nOperative times and postoperative complications were not significantly different compared to the previous reconstruction. We confirmed significant differences in operative bleeding and passage of food through the remnant stomach. The level of nutritional indicators at the end of postoperative year one did not tend to be lower, but total weight loss (TWL) and %TWL were significantly lower. As expected, there was a correlation between differences in jejunogastrostomy type and postoperative malnutrition.\\nThis method devised for intracorporeal DTR provided patients with improved postoperative nutritional status by directing more food through the remnant stomach after LPG. BarH‑like homeobox\\xa02 (BARX2), a homeobox gene, is associated with several types of cancers. The present study aimed to determine whether DNA methylation downregulates BARX2 expression and whether BARX2 is associated with suppression of gastric carcinogenesis. BARX2 protein expression in normal and cancerous gastric tissues and various gastric cancer (GC) cell lines was detected using immunohistochemical and western blot assays. BARX2 mRNA levels were detected using both reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Promoter hypermethylation in GC cells was detected using methylation‑specific PCR or bisulfite DNA sequencing PCR. Effects of BARX2 expression on GC cell proliferation, clonal formation, and migration were evaluated after lentivirus‑BARX2 transfection. The effect of stable BARX2 transfection on tumor formation was assessed in a nude xenograft mouse model. BARX2 was strongly expressed in the normal gastric mucosa, but weakly or not expressed in GC tissues and most GC cell lines. BARX2 expression was negatively correlated with DNMT (a marker for DNA methylation) expression in the gastric tissues. The BARX2 promoter fragment was hypermethylated in the GC cell lines. Overexpression of BARX2 significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation, clonal formation, and migration. Stable BARX2 transfection inhibited tumor formation in xenograft mice, which was correlated with decreased expression of E‑cadherin, proliferation markers, and matrix metalloproteinases. In conclusion, BARX2 expression is aberrantly reduced in GC, which is associated with increased DNA methylation of its promoter. BARX2 inhibits GC cell proliferation, migration, and tumor formation, suggesting that BARX2 acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric carcinogenesis. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or CTC clusters are considered as suitable and relevant targets for liquid biopsy as they more accurately indicate cancer progression, the therapeutic effects of treatment and allows for monitoring of cancer metastasis in real‑time. Among the various methods for isolating CTCs, size‑based filtration is one of the most convenient methods. However, cell clogging makes the filtration process less efficient. In the present study, an electromagnetic vibration‑based filtration (eVBF) device was developed that efficiently isolated rare CTCs and CTC clusters from clinical blood samples of patients with gastric cancer. Using human blood samples spiked with human gastric cancer cells, the parameters of this device such as vibrating amplitude and flow rate were optimized. Putative CTCs were detected using a conventional filtration method and the eVBF device from the peripheral blood samples of patients with gastric cancer. Continuous flow isolation of CTCs was evaluated by a simulated blood flow system. The eVBF device utilized the electromagnetic force to generate a periodic vibration that prevented the cell clogging and improved the filtering efficiency. The optimized eVBF device with the high‑amplitude vibration exhibited a recovery efficiency of 80‑90% from whole blood samples spiked with 100 or 1,000\\xa0gastric cancer cells per ml. Using the eVBF device, CTCs were detected in 100% of patients (10/10) with gastric cancer, and the positive detection rate of the eVBF device was 30% higher compared with the conventional filtration method. Furthermore, CTC clusters were detected in 40% (4/10) of CTC‑positive patient samples, and the integrity of CTC clusters was preserved using the eVBF device. The eVBF device allowed for high‑throughput (1\\xa0ml/min) and continuous flow isolation of CTCs without the addition of any antibodies, any chemical reagents or any pretreatment processes. Thus, the eVBF device provides an efficient tool for isolating rare CTCs and CTC clusters from patients with cancer, highlighting its potential for use in cancer diagnosis, treatment and cancer biology research. The prognosis of gastric cancer with para-aortic or bulky lymph node metastases is poor, but the JCOG 0405 study showed relatively good outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and gastrectomy with para-aortic lymph node dissection. We investigated the prognostic factors for this treatment.\\nTwenty patients who underwent gastrectomy and para-aortic lymph node dissection after chemotherapy were enrolled from two institutions. The prognostic factors for overall survival were retrospectively analysed using Cox\\'s proportional hazard models.\\nThe univariate analyses revealed that ypN (3/0-2, p=0.001), ypM1 (para-aortic LYM) (yes/no, p=0.03), histological response (Grade0-1b/2-3, p=0.02), and adjuvant chemotherapy (no/yes, p=0.02) were significant prognostic factors, whereas multivariate analysis revealed ypN and absence of adjuvant chemotherapy to be independent prognostic factors.\\nPosttreatment nodal status may be the best surrogate marker for gastric cancer with gastrectomy and para-aortic lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy seems to be essential to improve survival. To assess the prognostic effect of muscle loss after esophagectomy and before discharge.\\nThis study retrospectively analysed 159 consecutive patients with oesophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer who underwent esophagectomy between August 2011 and October 2015. Body composition was evaluated one week before surgery and at discharge using a bioelectrical impedance analyser.\\nThe median rate of muscle mass loss (RMML) was 4.38% (range=-3.3 to +18.8). Patients with increased RMML had significantly poorer outcomes of overall survival than those with decreased RMML (p=0.015). On multivariate analysis, RMML [≥4.38, hazard ratio (HR)=2.033, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.018-5.924, p=0.044) and pathological tumour depth (≥2, HR=3.099, 95%CI=1.339-7.172, p=0.008) were selected as independent prognostic factors.\\nRMML after esophagectomy is indicative of poor prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer. The efficacy of treatment using the anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibody for metastatic gastric cancer (mGC) has been established previously. Exploratory analyses in various types of tumours suggest that prior exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors can enhance the efficacy of subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy (CTx). Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CTx for mGC after progression on anti-PD-(ligand) 1 [anti-PD-(L)1] antibody.\\nWe retrospectively evaluated patients with mGC who underwent CTx. The patients received CTx after progression on anti-PD-(L)1 antibody (cohort A) or as a third-line treatment without prior exposure to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody (cohort B). We evaluated: i) clinical characteristics, ii) efficacies, iii) prognoses, and iv) adverse events (AEs).\\nIn cohorts A and B, 16 and 68 patients fulfilled the criteria, respectively. In the univariate analysis, the overall response rate was significantly higher in cohort A compared to cohort B (31% vs. 10%, respectively; Odds Ratio:3.96, 95% Confidence Interval:1.06-14.8, p=0.040). The multivariate analysis showed a similar trend. Immune-related AEs did not worsen and were manageable, while new immune-related AEs were not observed.\\nCTx after progression on anti-PD-(L)1 antibody demonstrated a favourable efficacy in intensively treated patients with mGC. We compared patients with advanced gastric cancer [Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) III] versus patients with stage UICC IV and peritoneal carcinomatosis treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) versus patients with stage UICC IV treated without HIPEC to ascertain if CRS and HIPEC improve overall survival (OS).\\nWe retrospectively analysed thirty-seven advanced gastric cancer patients who had been treated at our department from 2012 to 2017. The endpoint was median OS.\\nEighteen (49%) patients with UICC stage III showed a median OS of 37.4 months. Eight (21%) patients in the HIPEC group reached a median OS of 33.8 months. Median OS in the UICC IV group (11 patients, 30%) treated with a palliative concept was 6.2 months and therefore significantly worse (p=0.004).\\nA systemic approach combined with CRS and HIPEC in selected stage IV gastric cancer patients improves the OS comparable to patients in UICC stage III. We investigated the clinical role of the molecular targets, APEX1 and Jagged-1, and the Apex1 - Jagged-1 cascade in gastric cancer cells.\\nWe used 6 human gastric cancer cell lines (SNU-1, SNU-5, SNU-16, NCI-N87, KATO- III and AGS), and demonstrated the chemosensitivity of APEX1 and Jagged-1 through the MTT assay and immunoblotting. Tumor growth was assayed following cisplatin and 5-FU treatment using a xenograft model injected with KATO-III cells. Moreover, gastric tumor samples from 9 patients, divided in 2 groups according to chemotherapy response, were examined by immunocytochemical (IHC) staining, and protein expression levels were scored.\\nFollowing APEX1 knockdown, the MTT assay revealed that the IC\\nJagged-1-activated signaling by APEX1 plays a role in advanced gastric cancer.  Acute palliative care unit (APCU) is a novel inpatient program in a tertiary cancer center that provides aggressive symptom management and assists with the transition to hospice. However, patients often die in the APCU before successfully transferring to hospice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the symptom burden and characteristics of advanced cancer patients who died in the APCU.\\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all advanced cancer patients admitted to the APCU between April 2015 and March 2016 at a tertiary cancer center in Korea. Basic characteristics and symptom burden assessed by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) were retrieved. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare patients who died in the APCU with those who were discharged alive.\\nOf the 267 patients, 87 patients (33%) died in the APCU. The median age of the patients was 66 years (range, 23-97 years). The most common primary cancer types were lung (21%), stomach (17%), and colorectal cancer (15%). Patients who died in the APCU had higher ESAS scores for drowsiness (6 vs. 5, P=0.002), dyspnea (4 vs. 2, P=0.001), anorexia (8 vs. 6, P=0.014) and insomnia (6 vs. 4, P=0.002) compared to patients who were discharged alive. The total symptom distress score (SDS) was also significantly higher (47 vs. 40, P=0.001) in patients who died in the APCU. In the multivariate analysis, patients who died in the APCU were more likely to be male [odds ratio (OR) 2.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.49-4.64, P=0.001] and have higher ESAS scores for drowsiness (OR 2.08, 95% CI: 1.08-3.99, P=0.029) and dyspnea (OR 2.19, 95% CI: 1.26-3.80, P=0.005). Patients who died in the APCU showed significantly shorter survival after APCU admission (7 vs. 31 days, P<0.001).\\nAdvanced cancer patients who die in the APCU were more likely to be male and have significantly higher symptom burden including drowsiness and dyspnea. These patients showed rapid clinical deterioration after APCU admission. More proactive and timely end-of-life care is needed for these patients. In China, the incidence of cancer has significantly decreased over the last two decades. In contrast, the incidence of gastric carcinoma (GC) has risen in young patients.\\nWe reevaluated the histopathological results of 4,353 endoscopic gastroscopies from the Department of Pathology at No 1 Hospital of Liangshan. The ethnic groups Han and Yi were almost equally distributed in this cohort. Over a five-year period, 1407 GC were diagnosed.\\nIn 171 of these cases (12%), the patients were ≤40 years old (early-onset GC, EOGC). Out of this cohort, 9 patients were aged ≤25 years. 54% of these patients were male and showed marked predominance (92%) of the Yi-minority. Using the classification of Lauren, 103 GC (60%) were of diffuse type, 27 (16%) of intestinal type, and 41 (24%) of mixed type. In the remaining 1,236 cases of patients ≥41 years (88%), 1,014 patients (82%) belonged to the Yi-minority. \\nThis study demonstrates the unequal manifestation of EOGC within the two ethnic groups of Han and Yi. However, familial clustering was infrequent. Further investigations are necessary to discover relevant risk factors apart from hereditary predisposition. Minimally invasive surgery for gastric cancer (GC) has gained widespread use as a safe curative procedure especially for early GC.\\nTo determine risk factors for postoperative complications after minimally invasive gastrectomy for GC.\\nBetween January 2009 and June 2019, 1716 consecutive patients were referred to our division for primary GC. Among them, 1401 patients who were diagnosed with both clinical and pathological Stage III or lower GC and underwent robotic gastrectomy (RG) or laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) were enrolled. Retrospective chart review and multivariate analysis were performed for identifying risk factors for postoperative morbidity.\\nMorbidity following minimally invasive gastrectomy was observed in 7.5% of the patients. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that non-robotic minimally invasive surgery, male gender, and an operative time of ≥ 360 min were significant independent risk factors for morbidity. Therefore, morbidity was compared between RG and LG. Accordingly, propensity-matched cohort analysis revealed that the RG group had significantly fewer intra-abdominal infectious complications than the LG group (2.5% \\nThe findings showed that robotic surgery might improve short-term outcomes following minimally invasive radical gastrectomy by reducing intra-abdominal infectious complications. Gastric cancer risk evolves over time due to environmental, dietary, and lifestyle changes, including   The development of targeted anticancer drugs has been one of the most challenging goals of current research. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is an oncogene that stimulates mRNA translation via binding to the 5\\' endcap structure. It is well documented that eIF4E is overexpressed in many cancers including breast, prostate, head and neck, and stomach malignancies and leads to oncogenic transformation and metastasis. One approach to block eIF4E function in cancer cells is based on the disruption of the interaction between eIF4E and the 5\\' mRNA cap structure using cap analog inhibitors. Since analogs are cell-impermeable due to their anionic nature, we used a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) for delivery of model cap analogs into cancer cells. The human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV-1) transactivator of transcription derived peptide (TAT) was conjugated with the analogs m AB0 blood group antigens were discovered over a century ago; however, it is still important to study their role in development of various pathological conditions. Today it is known that antigenic determinants of this blood group are present not only on erythrocyte membrane but also on other cells and tissues: platelets, gastrointestinal epithelium and salivary glands, respiratory system cells. In the last decade, a large number of studies have appeared to reveal the relationship between a specific disease and blood group type, meta-analyses have been published. Previously, the authors have studied the metabolic status, cell composition and coagulation profile of clinically healthy individuals for more than on 180,000 donations, that allowed to identify groupspecific features for each blood group. This review presents generalized data on the association of such pathological conditions as coronary heart disease, thromboembolic complications, tumors of various localizations, inflammatory and destructive oral diseases, psychiatric and some infectious diseases with the presence or absence of antigenic determinants A and B. Carriers of blood group 0 (I) are generally more resistant to diseases, with the exception of H.pylori-associated gastrointestinal diseases. Carriers of «antigenic» blood groups A (II), B (III), AB (IV) are more susceptible to development of infectious, cardiovascular and cancer diseases. The presented data demonstrate clinical significance of the definition of group typing not only for selection of blood and its components during transfusion and transplantation, but also for diagnostics, determination of risk group and tactics for treatment patients with different nosologies. A number of studies have reported on associations between reproductive factors, such as delivery methods, number of birth and breastfeeding, and incidence of cancer in children, but systematic reviews addressing this issue to date have important limitations, and no reviews have addressed the impact of reproductive factors on cancer over the full life course of offspring.\\nWe performed a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, and Embase up to January 2020 and Web of Science up to 2018 July, including cohort studies reporting the association between maternal reproductive factors of age at birth, birth order, number of births, delivery methods, and breastfeeding duration and cancer in children. Teams of two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted random effects meta-analyses to estimate summary relative estimates, calculated absolute differences between those with and without risk factors, and used the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of evidence.\\nFor most exposures and most cancers, we found no suggestion of a causal relation. We found low to very low certainty evidence of the following very small possible impact: higher maternal age at birth with adult multiple myeloma and lifetime uterine cervix cancer incidence; lower maternal age at birth with childhood overall cancer mortality (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01-1.30; AR/10,000 = 1, 95% CI = 0 to 2), adult leukemia and lifetime uterine cervix cancer incidence; higher birth order with adult melanoma, cervix uteri, corpus uteri, thyroid cancer incidence, lifetime lung, corpus uteri, prostate, testis, sarcoma, thyroid cancer incidence; larger number of birth with childhood brain (RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.06-1.52; AR/10,000 = 1, 95% CI = 0 to 2), leukemia (RR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.62-2.75; AR/10,000 = 9, 95% CI = 5 to 14), lymphoma (RR = 4.66, 95% CI = 1.40-15.57; AR/10,000 = 11, 95% CI = 1 to 44) incidence, adult stomach, corpus uteri cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality, lifetime stomach, lung, uterine cervix, uterine corpus, multiple myeloma, testis cancer incidence; Caesarean delivery with childhood kidney cancer incidence (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.01-1.55; AR/10,000 = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 1); and breastfeeding with adult colorectal cancer incidence.\\nVery small impacts existed between a number of reproductive factors and cancer incidence and mortality in children and the certainty of evidence was low to very low primarily due to observational design. Successful treatment of indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (ITLPDGI) by chemotherapy is rare and watchful waiting is often performed for asymptomatic patients. We report a case of ITLPDGI successfully treated by involved field radiotherapy (IFRT). The patient presented with slow ITLPDGI localised to the stomach with mild symptoms. IFRT (30 Gy/20f) was administered, after which endoscopy revealed resolution of lesions and blood vessel appearance, and absence of proliferating abnormal lymphocytes was confirmed by biopsy. The patient remains lymphoma-free 1 year post-treatment. Although long-term follow-up and additional cases are essential for the evaluation of IFRT as a treatment option for localised ITLPDGL, complete remission after relatively low-dose IFRT is promising, particularly as this has been rarely achieved by chemotherapy. Cancer survival has improved in Western Australia (WA) over recent decades. Loss of life expectancy (LOLE) is a useful measure for assessing cancer survival at a population-level. Some previous studies estimating LOLE have required a minimum follow-up beyond diagnosis to reduce the impact of modelled extrapolation, while others have not. The first aim of this study was to assess the impact of minimum length of follow-up on LOLE estimates for people diagnosed in 2006 with female breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, cervical, combined oesophageal and stomach cancers, and melanoma. Based on these results, the second aim was to assess temporal changes in LOLE for these cancer types for diagnoses between 1982 and 2016.\\nPerson-level linked cancer registry and mortality data were used for invasive primary cancer diagnoses for WA residents aged 15-89 years. The analysis for aim one included cases diagnosed from 1982 to the end of 2006, followed to the end of 2006 (i.e. no minimum follow-up), 2011 (i.e. five years minimum follow-up, assuming survival) or 2016 (i.e. 10 years minimum follow-up). To achieve the second study aim, the diagnostic period was extended to the end of 2016. Life expectancy estimates were obtained after fitting flexible parametric relative survival models. Single-year age and sex-specific death rates were used as a reference to estimate LOLE and proportionate loss of life expectancy.\\nTemporal changes were not reported for prostate, cervical, oesophageal and stomach cancers or melanoma, due to differences in LOLE estimates by minimum follow-up time, or estimate imprecision. Marked reductions in LOLE were observed for female breast and colorectal cancer. There was minimal absolute reduction for lung cancer, where LOLE remained high.\\nThis study considered the appropriateness of including recent cancer diagnoses when assessing temporal changes in LOLE, finding variation in estimates with differing minimum follow-up or high parameter uncertainty for most included cancer types. Temporal changes in LOLE in-turn reflected changes in the life expectancy of the general population, cancer detection and management. These factors must be considered when estimating and interpreting LOLE estimates. To investigate histopathologic changes of muscularis mucosae (MM) and submucosa in the gastric cardia.\\nWe performed a histopathology study of 50 distal esophagectomies with proximal gastrectomies for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as the study (non-cancerous cardiac) group and 60 gastrectomies for early gastric cardiac carcinoma as the cancer group. The gastroesophageal junction was defined as the distal end of squamous epithelium, multilayered epithelium, or deep esophageal glands or ducts. Gastric cardia (n = 110) was defined as the presence of cardiac and cardio-oxyntic mucosae distal to the gastroesophageal junction.\\nThe average thickness of MM and submucosa in the cardia was 1.04 and 1.41\\u2009mm, respectively, which was significantly thicker than that in distal stomach (n = 34) (0.22 and 0.99\\u2009mm) or distal esophagus (n = 92) (0.60 and 1.15\\u2009mm). In the cardia, thickened MM displayed frayed muscle fibers (93.3%) with a significantly higher prevalence of entrapped glands, cysts, and lymphoid follicles than in the distal stomach or distal esophagus. In the submucosa fatty changes, cysts, and abnormal arteries were significantly more common in the cardia than in the distal stomach or distal esophagus. Compared with the study group, the cardia in the cancer group showed significantly thicker MM (average 1.31 vs 0.72\\u2009mm) and submucosa (average 1.61 vs 1.16\\u2009mm), more frequent frayed MM (93.3% vs 60.0%), prolapse-like changes (50.0% vs 2.0%), and cysts (26.7% vs 4.0%).\\nMM and submucosa of the cardia were significantly thickened, especially in early gastric cardiac carcinomas. High thyroid hormone values have been associated with an increased risk of incident cancers, especially breast cancer but also lung cancer and any solid cancers. We explored whether there is an increased risk of overall and cause-specific cancers in those receiving levothyroxine treatment. We included all individuals ≥ 18 years in Sweden (N = 8,573,313) on January 1 2009, and identified patients with two or more dispensed prescriptions of levothyroxine 2005-2006 (n = 253,193, 3.0 %). A cancer diagnosis in the Swedish Cancer Register 2009-2015 was used as outcome. We excluded patients with a cancer diagnosis before 2005. Cox regression was used (hazard ratios, HRs, and 95 % confidence intervals, CI) with adjustments for age, socioeconomic/neighborhood factors and co-morbidities. Totally 399,751 cases of incident cancer were identified, with a slight increased overall risk associated with levothyroxine treatment for both men, adjusted HR 1.06 (95 % CI 1.03-1.10), and women, adjusted HR 1.08 (95 % CI 1.07-1.10). For men, increased risks were found for cancers of the thyroid gland and other endocrine glands. For women, increased risks were found for cancers of the breast, endometrium, other female genitals (ovaries not included), stomach, colon, liver, pancreas, urinary bladder, skin, leukemia, and unspecified primary tumor. Unlike men, for women, no increased risk was found for cancer of the thyroid gland. In conclusions, levothyroxine treatment was associated with an excess cancer risk, including many different types of cancer, especially among women. Our results need confirmation by other studies, but levothyroxine is recommended to be prescribed only on approved indications. Robotic-assisted gastrectomy is increasingly utilized for the treatment of gastric malignancies. However, the benefits of robotic surgery have been questioned. This study describes short-term outcomes in the establishment of a comprehensive robotic program for gastric malignancies.\\nPatients who underwent robotic-assisted gastric resections between 2013 and 2018 were studied. Preoperative measures and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Finally we studied and analyzed robotic and open gastrectomy for the management of gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) at the same institution between 2000 and 2018 for quality benchmarking.\\nForty six patients (pts.) underwent robotic-assisted gastric resections. 26 (56.5%) were male, with a median age of 62\\xa0y (range: 29-87). Pathology included GC, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, neuroendocrine tumors, metastatic lesions, and benign processes. 19 pts. underwent total gastrectomy, 16 distal gastrectomy, four subtotal gastrectomy, and seven wedge resection. Pts. undergoing distal gastrectomy and wedge resection experienced shorter operative times and length of stay than total gastrectomy (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01; P\\xa0<\\xa00.01). Four operations (8.8%) were converted to open and 13 pts (28.3%) had postoperative complications, including an 8.7% readmission rate. Median lymph nodes retrieved during total, subtotal, and distal gastrectomy were 20 (13-46), 12.5 (0-26), and 16.5 (0-34), respectively. All pts. underwent margin negative resection. Median follow-up for GC was 21\\xa0mo, and 60% of pts. received adjuvant therapy at a median of 59d (range: 23-106).\\nRobotic gastrectomy is a feasible alternative to open gastrectomy. Our results will help establish benchmarks to improve perioperative outcomes, especially length of stay and time to initiation of therapy. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with nonhepatocellular carcinoma malignancies. We aimed to evaluate whether achieving a sustained virological response (SVR, defined as HCV RNA seronegativity throughout posttreatment 24-week follow-up) could reduce the risk of non-hepatocellular carcinoma malignancy in a real-world nationwide Taiwanese Chronic Hepatitis C Cohort (T-COACH).\\nA total of 10,714 patients with chronic hepatitis C who had received interferon-based therapy (8,186 SVR and 2,528 non-SVR) enrolled in T-COACH and were linked to the National Cancer Registry database for the development of 12 extrahepatic malignancies, including those with potential associations with HCV and with the top-ranking incidence in Taiwan, over a median follow-up period was 3.79 years (range, 0-16.44 years).\\nDuring the 44,354 person-years of follow-up, 324 (3.02%) patients developed extrahepatic malignancies, without a difference between patients with and without SVR (annual incidence: 0.69% vs 0.87%, respectively). Compared with patients with SVR, patients without SVR had a significantly higher risk of gastric cancer (0.10% vs 0.03% per person-year, P = 0.004) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (0.08% vs 0.03% per person-year, respectively, P = 0.03). When considering death as a competing risk, non-SVR was independently associated with gastric cancer (hazard ratio [HR]/95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 3.29/1.37-7.93, P = 0.008). When patients were stratified by age, the effect of SVR in reducing gastric cancer (HR/CI: 0.30/0.11-0.83) and NHL (HR/CI: 0.28/0.09-0.85) was noted only in patients aged <65 years but not those aged >65 years.\\nHCV eradication reduced the risk of gastric cancer and NHL, in particular among younger patients, indicating that patients with chronic hepatitis C should be treated as early as possible. We recently reported the dose-dependent therapeutic effect of  Metabolomics is useful for analyzing the nutrients necessary for cancer progression, as the proliferation is regulated by available nutrients. We studied the metabolomic profile of gastric cancer (GC) tissue to elucidate the associations between metabolism and recurrence.\\nCancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were obtained in a pair-wise manner from 140 patients with GC who underwent gastrectomy. Frozen tissues were homogenized and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). Metabolites were further assessed based on the presence or absence of recurrence.\\nNinety-three metabolites were quantified. In cancer tissues, the lactate level was significantly higher and the adenylate energy charge was lower than in non-cancerous tissues. The Asp, β-Ala, GDP, and Gly levels were significantly lower in patients with recurrence than in those without. Based on ROC analyses to determine the cut-off values of the four metabolites, patients were categorized into groups at high risk and low risk of peritoneal recurrence. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard analyses identified β-Ala as an independent predictor of peritoneal recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 5.21 [95% confidence interval 1.07-35.89], p\\u2009=\\u20090.029) and an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival (HR 3.44 [95% CI 1.65-7.14], p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).\\nThe metabolomic profiles of cancer tissues differed from those of non-cancerous tissues. In addition, four metabolites were significantly associated with recurrence in GC. β-Ala was both a significant predictor of peritoneal recurrence and a prognostic factor. Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, and it is also the third largest cause of cancer-related death in the world. As far as we know, no biomarker has been widely accepted for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to find potential biomarkers to predict the prognosis of GC. The gene expression profiles of GSE2685 were downloaded from GEO database. Morpheus was used to calculate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between primary advanced gastric cancer tissues and noncancerous gastric tissues. The gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed. Kaplan-Meier Plotter was used to determine the overall survival (OS) outcomes of UC5AC, MUC1, KRT7, GAPDH, CD44, and GEPIA was used to determine the Pearson correlation analysis. In total, 710 DEGs were identified in GC, including 396 upregulated genes and 314 downregulated genes. GO enrichment revealed that they were mainly enriched in binding, catalytic activity, cellular process and cell. KEGG pathway revealed that they were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. MUC5AC, MUC1, KRT7, GAPDH, CD44 were identified from the PPI network. MUC5AC, MUC1, KRT7, GAPDH, CD44 were demonstrated to have prognostic value for patients with GC. MUC5AC, MUC1 exhibited low expression levels in GC tissues, KRT7, GAPDH, CD44 presented high expression levels in GC tissues. In particular, KRT7 is hardly expressed in normal gastric tissues. MUC5AC and MUC1 were negatively correlated with GAPDH, CD44, respectively; and GAPDH was positively correlated with CD44 and KRT7, respectively. Moreover. MUC5AC, MUC1, KRT7, GAPDH, and CD44 are not only related to GC but also to apoptosis pathway. Results from the present study suggested that MUC5AC, MUC1, KRT7, GAPDH, CD44 may represent novel prognostic biomarkers for GC. MicroRNAs are known to be important in a variety of cancer types. The specific expression and roles of miR-338-3p in the context of gastric cancer, however, remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that miR-338-3p was expressed significantly lower in established/primary human gastric cancer cells than that in human gastric epithelial cells; miR-338-3p is also decreased in human gastric cancer tissues and was positively associated with the worse prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Enforced expression of miR-338-3p could inhibit cell growth, survival, and proliferation, while inducing cell apoptosis. In addition, miR-338-3p negatively regulated SOX5 expression through directly binding to the 3\\'-untranslated region of SOX5, and an inverse correlation was found between miR-338-3p and SOX5 messenger RNA expression in gastric cancer tissues. Furthermore, miR-338-3p-induced inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was greatly abrogated by SOX5 upregulation. Finally, we found that hypoxic conditions were linked with reduced miR-338-3p expression in the context of gastric cancer. In conclusion, miR-338-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, possibly by directly targeting SOX5 and blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These findings might provide novel therapeutic targets for gastric cancer. Frozen section examination of adenocarcinomas with poorly cohesive growth, including signet-ring cell carcinoma, is challenging. Due to their diffuse morphology, the tumor cells may be indistinct and difficult to distinguish from inflammatory or stromal cells. Misdiagnosis may result in significant adverse clinical outcome. We performed a detailed retrospective analysis of such cases to identify features that are helpful to avoid misdiagnosis at the time of frozen section. We reviewed the original frozen section slides from 50 patients with poorly cohesive carcinoma (PCC) including 32 with positive and 18 with negative frozen section slides. Tumor cells and inflammatory cells were evaluated for 17 distinct cytologic and nine architectural or stromal features. Features with 100% specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) for carcinoma included the presence of cells with a single distinct cytoplasmic mucin vacuole, focal gland formation, and perineural invasion. Features with high specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and negative predictive value (NPV) (all >\\u200975%) included irregular nuclear contours, large nuclear size with many nuclei >\\u20094× the size of a small lymphocyte, and disruption/obliteration of normal structures. Other features with high specificity and PPV (both ≥\\u200985%) but relatively low sensitivity and NPV-included crescent-shaped/indented nuclei, prominent nucleoli, anisonucleosis (>\\u20094:1 difference in nuclear size), multinucleation, and the presence of mitotic figures. We characterized useful histologic features of poorly cohesive carcinoma that may serve to distinguish carcinoma cells from benign inflammatory or stroma cells. Knowledge of the relatively specific features in particular may help surgical pathologists avoid false-negative interpretation resulting in significant clinical morbidity. Patients with autoimmune gastritis (AIG) are reported to have an increased risk of developing gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we assess the characteristics and outcomes of GC patients with AIG in a multicenter case-control study.\\nBetween April 2013 and May 2017, patients with GC, including cancers of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) Siewert type II and III, were recruited. Patients with histological characteristics of AIG were identified and matched in a 1:2 fashion for age and gender to GC patients with no AIG. Presenting symptoms were documented using a self-administered questionnaire.\\nHistological assessment of gastric mucosa was available for 572/759 GC patients. Overall, 28 (4.9%) of GC patients had AIG (67\\u2009±\\u20099 years, female-to-male ratio 1.3:1). In patients with AIG, GC was more likely to be localized in the proximal (i.e. EGJ, fundus, corpus) stomach (odds ratio (OR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-7.1). In GC patients with AIG, pernicious anemia was the leading clinical sign (OR 22.0, 95% CI 2.6-187.2), and the most common indication for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (OR 29.0, 95% CI 7.2-116.4). GC patients with AIG were more likely to present without distant metastases (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.3-28.8) and to be treated with curative intention (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.0-9.0). The five-year survival rates with 95% CI in GC patients with and with no AIG were 84.7% (83.8-85.6) and 53.5% (50.9-56.1), respectively (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.75, \\nPernicious anemia leads to earlier diagnosis of GC in AIG patients and contributes significantly to a better clinical outcome. One of the major challenges of advanced gastric cancer treatment is the lack of a standard regimen for patients. However, several clinical trials have shown that modified docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (m-DCF) and epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine (EOX) regimens are superior to other regimens.\\nThis randomized, single-center clinical trial was performed on 40 patients with advanced gastric cancer. The first group received the m-DCF regimen as follows: docetaxel (40 mg/m2) on the first day; cisplatin (40 mg/m2) on the first and second days; and 5-fluorouracil (400 mg/m2) from the first to fourth day. The second group received the EOX regimen, including epirubicin (50 mg/m2) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) i.v on the first day and capecitabine at a twice-daily dose of 625 mg/m2 p.o for 21 days. Treatment was applied every three weeks for a total of eight cycles in both groups. In each group, the overall and progression-free survival rates and toxicity were assessed.\\nA total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study (21 samples in the m-DCF group and 19 samples in the EOX group), 62.5% of whom were male. The median survival rate was 14.00 (95% CI: 11.82-16.18) months in the m-DCF group and 15.00 (95% CI: 9.56-20.43) months in the EOX group; however, differences between the groups were not significant. The progression-free survival rate was higher in the EOX group, although there was no significant difference between the two groups. Also, there was no significant difference regarding the side effects (e.g., toxicity) or need for supportive care between the groups.\\nIt seems that both m-DCF and EOX regimens are similar in terms of survival and toxicity and are recommended as first-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer with respect to the patient\\'s status. Nearly 50% of primary lung carcinoma patients present with distant metastasis at their first visit. However, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) metastasis is an infrequent impediment. Herein, we report a case of progressive dysphagia and epigastralgia as an initial manifestation of recurrence as gastric metastasis of primary lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after curative surgery. A 64-year-old man was diagnosed with primary lung SCC of the right lower lobe, and underwent thoracoscopic lower lobectomy. One year after lobectomy, computed tomography (CT) scan showed a gastric fundal mass located in the gastric cardia which measured 5 cm. Endoscopic biopsies and histopathology subsequently confirmed that tumor was SCC. The patient then underwent proximal gastrectomy with resection of the diaphragmatic crus. Following surgery, histopathological examination revealed gastric metastasis from primary lung SCC. KEY POINTS: Gastric metastasis of primary lung carcinoma is one of the rarest phenomena. Gastrointestinal symptoms should raise suspicion of the presence of advanced metastatic disease with poor prognosis. Splenectomy for dissecting splenic hilar lymph nodes (#10) should be avoided for most gastric cancer, considering the high morbidity and lack of any survival benefit, but it is often selected for scirrhous gastric cancer because this type frequently invades the whole stomach and lymph nodes. Splenectomy is necessary for dissecting #10; however, the survival benefit of dissecting #10 is unclear.\\nPatients who had scirrhous gastric cancer and underwent D2 total gastrectomy with splenectomy at National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan, between 2000 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The therapeutic value index was calculated by multiplying the metastatic rate of each nodal station and the 5-year survival of patients who had metastasis to each node.\\nIn total, 137 patients were eligible for the present study. The most frequent metastatic node was #3(58%), followed by #4d(46%), #1(35%), #4sb(23%), #6(22%), #7(21%), #4sa(18%), #10(15%), #2(14%), #11p(14%), #11d(13%), #9(13%), and #8a(11%). These lymph nodes had a metastatic rate of more than 10%. The node station with the highest index was #3(18.9), followed by #4d(14.1), #1(10.8), #4sa(6.11), #4sb(6.06), #10(5.09), #7(4.39), #11d(4.36), #11p(4.06), #2(2.93), #8a(2.18), and #9(1.45). The index of #10 exceeded that of #2, #7, #8a, and #9, which are the key nodes dissected in D2.\\nThe metastatic rate of the splenic hilar lymph nodes was relatively high, and the therapeutic index was the sixth highest among the 15 regional lymph nodes included in D2 dissection. Splenectomy for dissecting splenic hilar lymph nodes would be justified for scirrhous gastric cancer. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are markers of systemic inflammation. However, there is little evidence of the value of inflammation in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC). A total of 2,606 patients diagnosed with GC in the past three years and 3,219 healthy controls over the same period were included in this study. Peripheral blood samples were obtained to analyze the NLR, PLR, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). The optimal cutoff levels for the NLR and PLR were defined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (NLR = 2.258, PLR = 147.368). The value of different biomarkers for diagnosing GC was compared by the area under the curve (AUC). The NLR and PLR showed diagnostic sensitivity in GC (AUC = 0.715, AUC = 0.707). Using the Bonferroni correction, the NLR and PLR were superior to CEA and CA19-9 in the diagnosis of GC ( Gastric cancer is globally the fifth leading cause of cancer death. We present a case report describing the unique genomic characteristics of an Epstein-Barr virus-negative gastric cancer with esophageal invasion and regional lymph node metastasis. Genomic tests were performed first with the stomach biopsy using platforms FoundationOne, OncoDNA, and Oncopanel at Dana Farber Institute. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, residual tumor was resected and the stomach and esophageal residual tumor samples were compared with the initial biopsy by whole exome sequencing and molecular pathway analysis platform Oncobox. Copy number variation profiling perfectly matched the whole exome sequencing results. A moderate agreement was seen between the diagnostic platforms in finding mutations in the initial biopsy. Final data indicate somatic activating mutation Q546K in  Microsatellites are repeats of 1- to 6-bp units, and approximately 10 million microsatellites have been identified across the human genome. Microsatellites are vulnerable to DNA mismatch errors and have thus been used to detect cancers with mismatch repair deficiency. To reveal the mutational landscape of microsatellite repeat regions at the genome level, we analyzed approximately 20.1 billion microsatellites in 2717 whole genomes of pan-cancer samples across 21 tissue types. First, we developed a new insertion and deletion caller (MIMcall) that takes into consideration the error patterns of different types of microsatellites. Among the 2717 pan-cancer samples, our analysis identified 31 samples, including colorectal, uterus, and stomach cancers, with a higher proportion of mutated microsatellite (≥0.03), which we defined as microsatellite instability (MSI) cancers of genome-wide level. Next, we found 20 highly mutated microsatellites that can be used to detect MSI cancers with high sensitivity. Third, we found that replication timing and DNA shape were significantly associated with mutation rates of microsatellites. Last, analysis of mutations in mismatch repair genes showed that somatic SNVs and short indels had larger functional impacts than germline mutations and structural variations. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture of mutations in the microsatellite regions and reveals possible causes of mutations, as well as provides a useful marker set for MSI detection. Intussusception is defined as the invagination of one part of the gastrointestinal tract into another. Jejunogastric intussusception is a rare phenomenon following major upper abdominal surgery, where its aetiology is not well understood. We describe a 68-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain and haematemesis on the background of a previous pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for pancreatic cancer. Gastroscopy demonstrated retrograde jejunogastric intussusception, where part of the efferent jejunal limb had prolapsed into the remnant stomach. As a consequence, this intussuscepted segment had become oedematous and ischaemic. The patient subsequently underwent a laparotomy, where the original gastrojejunostomy was resected, which showed the intussuscepted jejunum. The non-viable portion was removed and a Roux-en-Y anastomosis was created. This case highlights the need to \\'think outside the box\\' with respect to differential diagnoses when a patient presents with abdominal pain on the background of previous complex abdominal surgery.  Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, an uncommon epithelial tumor, is mostly originated form the nasopharynx and also occurs in foregut-derived organs, such as lung, stomach, salivary gland, and thymus.\\xa0Primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (PPLELC) is a rare subtype accounting for around 0.9% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\\xa0We aimed to evaluate clinicopathological features, treatment modalities, and prognosis of PPLELC.\\nIn the current study, a retrospective analysis on 8 patients diagnosed with PPLELC at Hunan Cancer Hospital between October 2013 and June 2016 was conducted with respect to their clinical characteristics and outcomes, in order to deeply investigate this rare subtype of lung cancer.\\nIn all 8 patients, 62.5% (5/8) were female, and the median age was 51.5 years (range 41 years-64 years).\\xa0The majority (87.5%) were never smokers and 50.0% were asymptomatic at diagnosis.\\xa0About 37.5% presented with stage I disease, 50.0% had stage III disease and 12.5% had stage IV disease. Histologically, the tumor morphology was indistinguishable from undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx and were characterized by poorly differentiated tumor cells with large vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli showing syncytial growth patterns and accompanied by heavy lymphocytic infiltration. The tumor cells were presented as positive for P63 (100.0%, 6/6), CK5/6 (100.0%, 5/5), CK (100.0%, 5/5). The expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 8 patients was detected. When membranous staining was present in ≥5% of the cells, it was defined as PD-L1 positive. The PD-L1 expression frequency was 50.0% (4/8), and the tumor proportion score (TPS) fluctuated between 20.0% and 70.0%. Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) mutations were detected in 3 cases and all tested samples were wild type;\\xa0moreover, ALK rearrangement was negative in 2 patients with available data. KRAS, B-raf, C-kit, HER2, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were detected in 1 case. The results showed that KRAS was wild type, B-raf and C-kit mutation was negative, and HER2, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were moderately expressed. All patients underwent surgery with or without adjuvant therapy. Among these patients, 5 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, including 2 patients with stage Ib disease, 2 patients with stage IIIa disease and 1 patient with stage IV disease.\\xa01 patient with stage IIIa disease received adjuvant chemotherapy\\xa0and radiotherapy and 1 patient with stage IIIa disease received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All patients survived until the deadline for follow-up. The median survival time of all LELC patients is 57 months.\\xa0The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of LELC patients were 87.5% and 50.0%, disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 87.5% and 50.0%, respectively.\\nPPLELC is uncommon but distinct subtype of NSCLC with unique clinicopathologic characteristics that tends to affect young nonsmoking patients, without significant predilection for sex and with strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Histology and immunohistochemistry are the main diagnostic methods. Rare or no driver gene mutations were found in the common oncogenes such as EGFR mutations and ALK gene rearrangement, implying that the mutagenesis of these genes was not involved in the tumorigenesis of PPLELC. PD-1 and PD-L1 may be potential therapeutic targets for PPLELC.\\xa0The patients are diagnosed at an earlier stage and have a better\\xa0prognosis than those with other non-small cell lung\\xa0cancer.\\xa0No standardized treatment regimens currently exist for this rare tumor. The mainstay of treatment for early-stage disease is curative surgical resection, whereas multimodality treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) has been adopted in advanced or metastatic diseases. Due to its low incidence, further research is needed to determine its biological characteristics and optimal treatment options.\\n【中文题目：原发性肺淋巴上皮瘤样癌8例临床分析】 【中文摘要：背景与目的 淋巴上皮瘤样癌为罕见的上皮肿瘤，多来源于鼻咽部，也发生在前肠起源器官，如肺、胃、唾液腺和胸腺。原发性肺淋巴上皮瘤样癌（primary pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, PPLELC）是一种罕见的非小细胞肺癌（non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC），约占肺癌的0.9%。本文目的在于探讨PPLELC的临床病理特点、治疗方法以及预后情况。方法 回顾性分析湖南省肿瘤医院2013年10月-2016年6月收治的PPLELC患者8例，对其临床资料及预后进行临床分析，以深入研究这种罕见的肺癌亚型。结果 8例患者中，62.5%（5/8）为女性，中位年龄为51.5岁（41岁-64岁），大多数（87.5%）患者不吸烟，50.0%患者无症状，约37.5%为I期，50.0%为III期，12.5%为IV期。PPLELC的典型病理特征与未分化的鼻咽癌相同，其特点是分化较差的肿瘤细胞，具有大的泡状核和核仁突出，呈合胞体生长，伴有淋巴细胞浸润。免疫表型：癌细胞P63（100.0%, 6/6）、CK5/6（100.0%, 5/5）、CK（100.0%, 5/5）阳性。对8例患者的程序性死亡配体-1（programmed cell death-ligand 1, PD-L1）表达进行了检测，当≥5%的细胞膜染色时定义为PD-L1阳性，PD-L1表达频率为50.0%（4/8），肿瘤细胞阳性比例分数（tumor proportion score, TPS）波动在20.0%-70.0%。3例行表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR）基因突变检测，结果呈阴性；2例行EML4-ALK融合基因检测，结果呈阴性；1例行KRAS、B-raf、C-kit、HER2、VEGFR1、VEGFR2检测，结果示KRAS野生型，B-raf、C-kit无突变，HER2、VEGFR1、VEGFR2中等表达。所有患者均接受了手术治疗，其中接受了辅助化疗者5例，其中Ib期2例，IIIa期2例，IV期1例；辅助放化疗者1例，分期为IIIa期，接受了新辅助化疗者1例，分期为IIIa期。截止至随访截止期，所有患者均存活，中位存活时间为57个月，3年和5年总生存率（overall survival, OS）分别为87.5%和50.0%；无病生存率（disease-free survival, DFS）分别为87.5%和50.0%。结论 PPLELC是一种罕见但独特的NSCLC亚型，具有明显的临床病理学特征，通常发生于年轻的非吸烟患者，无性别倾向，并与EB病毒（Epstein-Barr virus, EBV）感染有关，组织形态及免疫组化是诊断的主要手段。大多数患者缺乏EGFR和ALK等常见基因突变，提示这些基因的突变与PPLELC的发生无关。PD-1和PD-L1可能是潜在的治疗靶点。与其他类型的NSCLC相比，大多数患者处于早期或局部晚期，预后较好。目前还没有针对这种罕见肿瘤的标准化治疗方案。早期以手术切除为主，中晚期或转移阶段则采用手术、化疗、放疗等多种治疗方式。由于其发病率低，为了确定其生物学特性和最佳治疗方案，还需要进一步的研究。】 【中文关键词：淋巴上皮瘤样癌；肺肿瘤；临床病理；预后】. Intestinal-type gastric cancer (IGC) has a clear and multistep histological evolution. No studies have comprehensively explored gastric tumorigenesis from inflammation through low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) to early gastric cancer (EGC). We sought to investigate the characteristics participating in IGC tumorigenesis and identify related prognostic information within the process. RNA expression profiles of 94 gastroscopic biopsies from 47 patients, including gastric precancerous lesions (GPL: LGIN and HGIN), EGC, and paired controls, were detected by Agilent Microarray. During IGC tumorigenesis from LGIN through HGIN to EGC, the number of activity-changed tumor hallmarks increased. LGIN and HGIN had similar expression profiles when compared to EGC. We observed an increase in the stemness of gastric epithelial cells in LGIN, HGIN, and EGC, and we found 27 consistent genes that might contribute to dedifferentiation, including five driver genes. Remarkably, we perceived that the immune microenvironment was more active in EGC than in GPL, especially in the infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. We identified a five-gene signature from the gastric tumorigenesis process that could independently predict the overall survival and disease-free survival of GC patients (log-rank test: p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), and the robustness was verified in an independent cohort (n\\u2009>\\u2009300) and by comparing with two established prognostic signatures in GC. In conclusion, during IGC tumorigenesis, cancer-like changes occur in LGIN and accumulate in HGIN and EGC. The immune microenvironment is more active in EGC than in LGIN and HGIN. The identified signature from the tumorigenesis process has robust prognostic significance for GC patients. © 2020 The Authors.

Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double-flap technique (LPG-DFT) and laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy (LSTG) may replace laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for proximal early gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes after LPG-DFT and LSTG.\\nPatients who underwent LPG-DFT or LSTG at the Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo between January 2006 and April 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Operative procedures were selected based on the distance from the cardia to the proximal boundary of the tumour, tumour location and predicted remnant stomach volume. Patient characteristics, surgical data, markers of postoperative nutritional status, such as blood chemistry and bodyweight loss, and endoscopic findings were compared between procedures. The main study outcome was nutritional status.\\nA total of 161 patients (LPG-DFT 51, LSTG 110) were included. Types of postoperative complication occurring more than 30\\u2009days after surgery differed between the two procedures. Remnant stomach ulcers, including anastomotic ulcers, were observed only after LPG-DFT, whereas complications involving the small intestine, such as internal hernia or small bowel obstruction, occurred more frequently after LSTG. Values for total protein, albumin, prealbumin and bodyweight loss were comparable between the two procedures at 36\\u2009months after surgery. Haemoglobin concentrations were higher after LPG-DFT than after LSTG at 24\\u2009months (13·4 versus 12·8\\u2009g/dl respectively; P\\xa0=\\u20090·045) and 36\\u2009months (13·5 versus 12·8\\u2009g/dl; P\\u2009=\\u20090·007) after surgery. The rate of Los Angeles grade B or more severe reflux oesophagitis was comparable.\\nLPG-DFT and LSTG for proximal early gastric cancer have similar outcomes, but different types of complication.\\nLa gastrectomía proximal laparoscópica con técnica de doble derivación (double flap technique, LPG-DFT) y la gastrectomía subtotal laparoscópica (laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy, LsTG) pueden sustituir a la gastrectomía total laparoscópica (laparoscopic total gastrectomy, LTG) para el cáncer gástrico precoz (early gastric cancer, EGC) proximal. El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar los resultados a corto y a largo plazo tras LPG-DFT y LsTG. MÉTODOS: En este estudio retrospectivo se incluyeron pacientes que fueron sometidos a LPG-DFT o LsTG en el Hospital del Instituto del Cáncer de Tokio entre enero 2006 y abril 2015. Las técnicas quirúrgicas se seleccionaron en base a la distancia entre el cardias y el borde proximal del tumor, localización del tumor, y el volumen previsto del remanente gástrico. Las características de los pacientes, datos quirúrgicos, marcadores del estado nutricional postoperatorio, tales como la bioquímica sanguínea y la pérdida de peso corporal (body weight loss, BWL), y los hallazgos endoscópicos se compararon entre las técnicas. El resultado principal del estudio fue el estado nutricional.\\nSe incluyeron un total de 161 pacientes (LPG-DFT 51, LsTG 110). Los tipos de complicaciones postoperatorias que aparecieron a más de 30 días después de la cirugía variaron entre ambas técnicas. Las úlceras en el remanente gástrico, incluyendo úlceras anastomóticas, solo se observaron tras una LPG-DFT, mientras las complicaciones relacionadas con el intestino delgado, como la hernia interna o la obstrucción de intestino delgado, sucedió con más frecuencia tras una LsTG. Los valores de proteínas totales, albúmina, prealbúmina, y BWL fueron comparables entre ambas técnicas a los 36 meses después de la cirugía. Las concentraciones de hemoglobina fueron más altas tras una LPG-DFT que tras una LsTG a los 24 (13,4 versus 12,8 mg/dL, P = 0,045) y 36 meses (13,5 versus 12,8 mg/mL, P = 0,007) después de la cirugía. Las incidencias de esofagitis por reflujo grado B Los Angeles o más grave fueron comparables. CONCLUSIÓN: La LPG-DFT y la LsTG para el EGC proximal presentan resultados bastante similares, pero difieren en el tipo de complicaciones. The incidence of de novo gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after LSG is substantial. However, an objective correlation with the structural gastric and EGJ changes has not been demonstrated yet. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on the structure and function of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and stomach.\\nInvestigations were performed before and after >\\u200950% reduction in excess body weight (6-12\\xa0months after LSG). Subjects with GERD at baseline were excluded. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), high-resolution manometry (HRM), and ambulatory pH-impedance measurements were used to assess the structure and function of the EGJ and stomach before and after LSG.\\nFrom 35 patients screened, 23 (66%) completed the study (age 36\\u2009±\\u200910\\xa0years, BMI 42\\u2009±\\u20095\\xa0kg/m\\nLSG has multiple effects on the EGJ and stomach that facilitate reflux. In particular, EGJ disruption as indicated by increased (more obtuse) esophagogastric insertion angle and small gastric capacity were associated with the risk of GERD after LSG. clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01980420. Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In recent years, SAMD14 has been studied in various malignant cancers; however, little is known about the exact mechanisms of SAMD14 involvement in carcinogenesis and malignant progression.\\n60 paired GC-normal gastric tissues were evaluated for their SAMD14 mRNA expression in relation to SAMD14 gene promoter methylation. GC patient survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analyses and a Cox\\'s proportional hazard model was employed for multivariate analyses.\\nSAMD14 expression was significantly inversely correlated with the Borrmann type (P\\u2009=\\u20090.017), lymph node metastasis (P\\u2009=\\u20090.006) and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P\\u2009=\\u20090.033). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) revealed hyper-methylation of the SAMD14 promoter in 56.7% (34/60) of the primary GC tissues tested and in 10% (6/60) of matched non-malignant tissues. The SAMD14 promoter methylation status was also related to pathological differentiation, Borrmann type, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. The results showed SAMD14 expression was significantly downregulated in Borrmann type, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage, which showed significantly higher methylation. SAMD14 promoter hyper-methylation was significantly associated with a poor prognosis and could serve as an independent marker for survival using multivariate Cox regression analysis.\\nOur results indicated that promoter methylation was a key mechanism contributing to the downregulation of SAMD14 in GC. SAMD14 may be an epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor gene, and hyper-methylation of the SAMD14 promoter may serve as a biomarker to predict the clinical outcome of GC. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastrointestinal disorders; given they increase the systemic levels of gastrin, a trophic hormone, there is a concern about their carcinogenicity. This study evaluated the association between PPI use and gastrointestinal cancers.\\nWe performed a nested case-control study in a large, community-based integrated healthcare setting. Cases were adults with gastric (n = 1,233), colorectal (n = 18,595), liver (n = 2,329), or pancreatic cancers (n = 567). Each case was matched with up to 10 controls by age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical facility, and enrollment duration. The primary exposure was defined as ≥2-year cumulative PPI supply. Data were obtained from pharmacy, cancer registry, and electronic medical record databases. Associations were evaluated using conditional logistic regression and adjusted for multiple confounders. We also evaluated the cancer risks separately by PPI dose, duration of use, and dose and duration.\\nPPI use of ≥2-years was not associated with the risks of gastric (odds ratio [OR]: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-1.42), colorectal (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.99-1.12), liver (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91-1.43), or pancreatic cancers (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.89-1.67), compared to non-users. In exploratory analyses, elevated cancer risks were primarily restricted to those with ≥10 years of PPI use, but no consistent associations were found for increasing PPI dose and/or duration of use.\\nPPI use of ≥2 years was not associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal cancers. The cancer risks associated with PPI use of ≥10 years requires further study. Gastric cancer is associated with chronic inflammation (gastritis) triggered by persistent Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of the latent transcription factor STAT3 is a feature of gastric cancer, including H. pylori-infected tissues, and aligns with nuclear transcriptional activity. However, the transcriptional role of STAT3 serine phosphorylation, which promotes STAT3-driven mitochondrial activities, is unclear. Here, by coupling serine-phosphorylated (pS)-STAT3-deficient Stat3 In recent years, the technological innovation and progress of endoscopic equipment have been remarkable, and various endoscopic observation techniques have been developed. Among them, representative techniques are magnified observation and narrow-band imaging. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) can visualize superficial microanatomies in the stomach. The normal morphology of the microanatomy visualized using M-NBI differs according to the part of the stomach. The vessel plus surface (VS) classification system has been developed as a diagnostic criterion for early gastric cancer using M-NBI, and its usefulness has been proven. Based on the VS classification system, a magnifying endoscopy simple diagnostic algorithm for early gastric cancer (MESDA-G), a simplified algorithm used for early gastric cancer diagnosis, was created. We aimed to describe the anatomic structure of the stomach that can be viewed using M-NBI and outline the principles and clinical application of the VS classification system and MESDA-G. In this review article, we explore patient selection criteria for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) gastrectomy, present evidence on the risks and benefits of minimally invasive techniques, describe operative techniques focusing specifically on reconstruction options, and discuss the learning curve associated with these operations. With dichotomous etiology and pathogenesis, intestinal type and diffuse type gastric cancers vary in their clinical and molecular features to the point of representing distinct entities. However, the differences of tumor-infiltrating immune cells within the two types of gastric cancer have not been well researched. This study was aimed to evaluate the functional impact of Lauren classification on immune contexture in gastric cancer patients. Tumor tissues of gastric cancer patients from Zhongshan Hospital and gastric cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were analyzed. By immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we found that intratumoral CD8 None β-Elemene is a natural agent extracted from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Curcuma wenyujin that is a promising novel plant-derived drug with broad-spectrum anticancer activity. Our previous study identified an enhanced capacity for metastasis in multidrug resistant (MDR) gastric cancer and breast cancer cells. However, the anti-metastatic effects of β-Elemene on MDR cancer cells remain unknown.\\nIn this study, we posit the hypothesis that β-elemene possesses antimetastatic effects on MDR cancer cells.\\nCell viability assay was used to assess the resistance of SGC7901/ADR cells and the cytotoxic effects of β-Elemene. Wound healing, transwell assay and lung metastatic mice model were used to the anti-metastasis effects of β-Elemene. MicroRNA microarray analysis was used to explore potential regulated miRNAs. Luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the direct target. Human MMP antibody array, western blot, immunoprecipitation, qRT-PCR analyses and immunohistochemistry were conducted to investigate the underlying anti-metastasis mechanism of β-Elemene.\\nIn this study, we found that β-Elemene significantly inhibited the metastatic capacity of MDR gastric cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that β-Elemene regulated MMP-2/9 expression and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Further studies showed that β-Elemene upregulated Cbl-b expression, resulting in inhibition of the EGFR-ERK/AKT pathways, which regulate MMP-2/9. Additionally, we confirmed that β-Elemene upregulated Cbl-b by inhibiting miR-1323 expression. Finally, we found that numbers of metastatic tumor nodules were significantly decreased in the lungs of nude mice after β-Elemene treatment.\\nOur results suggested that β-Elemene inhibits the metastasis of MDR gastric cancer cells by modulating the miR-1323/Cbl-b/EGFR signaling axis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate various POSSUM scoring systems in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with gastric cancer.\\nA total of 1262 patients with gastric cancer who underwent curative gastrectomy between January 2006 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The subjects were stratified by age into <80 years old and ≥80 years old. To assess the predictability and efficacy of various POSSUM scores (POSSUM, P-POSSUM, O-POSSUM, and E-POSSUM), the observed-to-expected (O:E) ratio and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated and compared with actual postoperative morbidity and mortality.\\nAmong the 1262 patients, 75 were elderly (≥80 years old). The observed mortality rates were 0.5% (n\\xa0=\\xa06) in the whole cohort, and 4.0% (n\\xa0=\\xa03) in elderly patients. The predicted mortalities of POSSUM, P-POSSUM, E-POSSUM, and O-POSSUM for elderly patients were 13.2%, 5.3%, 5.7%, and 21.8%, respectively (O:E ratio\\xa0=\\xa00.3, 0.75, 0.7, and 0.18, respectively). P-POSSUM and E-POSSUM showed superior discriminatory power compared to POSSUM and O-POSSUM. In terms of morbidity, E-POSSUM showed better predictive capabilities than POSSUM in elderly patients (O:E ratio\\xa0=\\xa00.56 and 0.74, respectively).\\nAll POSSUM scoring systems tend to overestimate postoperative mortality and morbidity in gastric cancer patients. E-POSSUM and P-POSSUM provided a better prediction of mortality and morbidity after curative gastrectomy in elderly patients compared to other POSSUM scores. New endoscopic resection techniques are constantly being developed for gastric adenoma, which can be classified as low or high grade according to the Vienna classification. However, long-term data on gastric adenoma (e.g., removal or follow-up after resection via endoscopy) remain lacking.We retrospectively analyzed 133 cases with gastric adenoma that underwent endoscopic resection from January 2010 to November 2018. We analyzed the risk factors and frequency of patients with synchronous and metachronous lesions after endoscopic resection for gastric adenoma and followed them for more than 2 years.One hundred six (79.7%) and 27 patients (20.3%) received endoscopic resection (ER) once and more than twice, respectively. Compared with the initial endoscopic biopsy pathological results, the upgraded and downgraded histological discrepancy rates were 10.5% (n\\u200a=\\u200a14) and 3.0% (n\\u200a=\\u200a4) after resection, respectively. The mean time to synchronous/metachronous recurrence was 2.23 years. The average lesion size at first procedure was larger in the multiple ER group than in the single ER group (2.00 vs 1.10\\u200acm; P\\u200a=\\u200a.040). Eleven (8.3%) and 16 patients (12.0%) had recurred synchronous and metachronous lesions, respectively. In the multivariate Cox analysis of the recurrence group, intestinal metaplasia (hazard ratio, 2.761; 95% confidence interval, 1.117-6.820; P\\u200a=\\u200a.028) and lesion size (hazard ratio, 1.607; 95% confidence interval, 1.082-2.385; P\\u200a=\\u200a.019) were independent factors for receiving endoscopic resection more than twice.If patients have severe intestinal metaplasia or large size of lesion at endoscopic resection for gastric adenoma, periodic observation is necessary.   To investigate the prognostic impact of D2-plus lymphadenectomy including the posterior (No. 8p, No. 12b/p, No. 13, and No. 14v), and para-aortic (No. 16a2, and No. 16b1) lymph nodes (LNs) in subtotal gastrectomy for advanced gastric antral carcinoma.\\nA total of 203 patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) located in the antrum, who underwent R0 gastrectomy with D2 or D2-plus lymphadenectomy between January 2003 and December 2011 were enrolled. Propensity score matching was used to reduce the strength of the confounding factors to accurately evaluate prognoses. The therapeutic value index (TVI) was calculate to evaluate the survival benefit of dissecting each LN station.\\nOf 102 patients with D2-plus lymphadenectomy, 21 (20.59%) were pathologically identified as having LN metastases beyond the extent of D2 lymphadenectomy. After matching, the overall survival (OS) was significantly better in the D2-plus than the D2 group (P=0.030). In the multivariate survival analysis, D2-plus lymphadenectomy (hazard ratio, 0.516; P=0.006) was confirmed to significantly improve the survival rate. In the logistic regression analysis, pN stage [odds ratio (OR), 2.533; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.368-4.691; P=0.003] and extent of LNs metastasis (OR, 5.965; 95% CI, 1.335-26.650; P=0.019) were identified as independent risk factors for LN metastases beyond the extent of D2 lymphadenectomy. The TVI of patient with metastasis to LNs station was 7.1 (No. 8p), 5.7 (No. 12p), 5.1 (No. 13), and 7.1 (both No. 16a2 and No. 16b1), respectively.\\nD2-plus lymphadenectomy may improve the prognoses of some patients with advanced GC located in the antrum, especially for No. 8p, No. 12b, No. 13, and No. 16. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence and development of de novo malignancy (DNM) after liver transplantation (LT) are the major causes of late recipient death.\\nWe analyzed the incidence of extrahepatic DNM following living donor LT according to the status of pretransplant hepatic malignancy. We selected 2,076 adult patients who underwent primary LDLT during 7 years from January 2010 to December 2016.\\nThe pretransplant hepatic malignancy group (n = 1,012) showed 45 cases (4.4%) of the following extrahepatic DNMs: posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in 10; lung cancer in 10; stomach cancer in 6; colorectal cancer in 5; urinary bladder cancer in 3; and other cancers in 11. The pretransplant no hepatic malignancy group (n = 1,064) showed 25 cases (2.3%) of the following extrahepatic DNMs: colorectal cancer in 3; stomach cancer in 3; leukemia in 3; lung cancer in 3; PTLD in 2; prostate cancer in 2; and other cancers in 9. Incidences of extrahepatic DNM in the pretransplant hepatic malignancy and no hepatic malignancy groups were as follows: 1.1% and 0.5% at 1 year, 3.2% and 2.0% at 3 years, 4.6% and 2.5% at 5 years, and 5.4% and 2.8% at 8 years, respectively (\\nOur results suggest that patients who had pretransplant hepatic malignancy be followed up more strictly because they have a potential risk of primary hepatic malignancy recurrence as well as a higher risk of extrahepatic DNM than patients without pretransplant hepatic malignancy. The incidence of gastric cancer (GC) in elderly patients has increased, and it is important for predicting prognosis for those patients. The prognostic nutrition index (PNI), which is a indicator of nutrition status, is useful for the assessment of prognosis for various cancers. The aim of this propensity score-matched study was to investigate the significance of the PNI for predicting the long-term outcome of GC patients who were 80\\xa0years old or older. This study included 127 elderly GC patients who underwent gastrectomy. The optimal cutoff value for the PNI score was defined using a receiver operating curve analysis. For the analysis of long-term outcomes, 86 patients were selected by propensity score matching. The long-term outcomes and prognostic factors after gastrectomy were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The cutoff value for the PNI score was set at 46.5. Among the 86 patients, 30 patients died due to noncancer-related disease. The 5-year cancer-specific survival rates of patients with a PNI score\\u2009<\\u200946.5 and PNI score\\u2009≥\\u200946.5 were 73.5% and 84.6%, respectively (P\\u2009=\\u20090.832). The 5-year overall survival rates of patients with a PNI score\\u2009<\\u200946.5 and PNI score\\u2009≥\\u200946.5 were 38.2% and 49.3%, respectively (P\\u2009=\\u20090.004). According to the multivariate analysis, the PNI score (HR 2.15; 95% CI 1.37-3.94; P\\u2009=\\u20090.013) and pathological stage (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.02-4.61; P =\\u20090.045) were independent prognostic factors. The PNI is a promising assessment tool for predicting OS in elderly GC patients. Distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, a standard operative technique for gastric cancer treatment, is safely performed because the stomach has a rich vascular supply. Gastric remnant necrosis caused by cholesterol crystal embolization following distal gastrectomy has not been described previously. We report a case of gastric remnant necrosis in a patient with cholesterol crystal embolization.\\nA 70-year-old man with a history of cholesterol crystal embolization presented to our surgery department with complaints of anorexia and dysphasia. He was diagnosed with gastric cancer invading the pyloric antrum and underwent distal gastrectomy with Billroth 2 reconstruction. On postoperative day 11, he developed abdominal pain without fever. Emergency laparotomy revealed that most parts of the remnant stomach were necrosed. Total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction and abscess drainage were performed. After surgery, anastomotic leakage occurred and was treated conservatively. However, the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm suddenly ruptured and he expired.\\nGastric remnant necrosis after distal gastrectomy can be a gastrointestinal presentation of cholesterol crystal embolization. Perioperative/intraoperative risk assessments such as preventive total gastrectomy or intraoperative assessment with indocyanine green fluorescence angiography may be desirable to avoid this complication.  Though the socioeconomic burden of cancer on patients is increasing in South Korea, there is little research regarding the type of cancer that incurs the highest costs. This study analyzed the socioeconomic burden on cancer patients from 2011 to 2015 according to sex and age.\\nA prevalence-based approach was applied utilizing claim data of the National Health Insurance Service in Korea to estimate the socioeconomic burden of cancer on patients. Patients who received treatment for cancer from 2011 to 2015 were the study subjects. The total socioeconomic burden of their disease and treatment was divided into direct and indirect costs.\\nThere was an increase of 50.7% for 5 years, from 821,525 to 1,237,739 cancer patients. The cancer costs for men and women increased $8,268.4 million to $9,469.7 million and $3,626.5 million to $4,475.6 million, respectively. Furthermore, the 50-59-year-old age group accounted for a large portion of the total disease cost. Liver, lung, stomach, and colorectal cancers created the heaviest economic burdens on patients.\\nOverall, this study indicates new policies for cancer prevention, early detection, and post-cancer treatment management are necessary to help limit the costs associatedwith cancer, especially in the elderly, and provides a foundation for establishing cancer-related health care policies, particularly by defining those cancers with heavier disease burdens. The treatment of advanced, solid-tumor oncology has been reshaped over the last eight years with the development and FDA approval of several immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) comprised of monoclonal antibodies targeting either PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 across numerous disease states and indications. Yet, despite their vast expansion of use in both solid-tumor and hematologic malignancies, gastrointestinal cancers have had limited approvals to date. This review article will focus on the use of the currently studied, approved uses and the potential future roles of ICIs in the treatment of cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract through recent updates on ongoing studies and discussion of phase III studies underway. A single immunotherapy agent, Pembrolizumab, is the only currently approved treatment option in subset of patients with unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal, gastroesophageal, or gastric cancers after failure or intolerance of initial systemic treatments. The only patients who are currently considered for treatment with ICI are those with tumors that are either microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), or in those with esophageal, GEJ, or gastric adenocarcinomas that have at least one-percent expression of PD-L1 after failing at least two lines of systemic therapy based on early results from the KEYNOTE-059 trial released in 2017, or second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or greater based on the combined results from KEYNOTE-180 and KEYNOTE-181 in 2019. However, despite these limited successes thus far, there are numerous ongoing studies evaluating several ICIs for efficacy and safety in esophageal, GEJ, and gastric cancers. These agents are being studied in countless aspects of these malignancies: from neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in resectable disease to first-line treatment and beyond in the advanced, unresectable, or metastatic setting. In this article we will review the currently approved agents as well as ongoing clinical trials that will be approaching completion in the next 5 years, potentially altering the landscape of treatment in upper GI malignancies. Laparoscopic radical gastrectomy is currently the most common surgical approach for gastric cancer. The main difference between totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) and laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) is the route of digestive tract reconstruction. However, TLTG is currently not widespread as the safety and feasibility of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy is uncertain.\\nTo compare the short-term efficacy of TLTG and LATG for radical gastrectomy of gastric cancer, and to determine the safety and feasibility of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy.\\nPubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched for all relevant articles regarding TLTG \\nEight studies involving a total of 1883 cases (869 cases in the TLTG group and 1014 cases in the LATG group) were included. Compared with the LATG group, reduced intraoperative blood loss (weighted mean difference = -35.37, 95%CI: -61.69 - -9.06, \\nIntracorporeal esophagojejunostomy is safe and feasible. TLTG has the advantages of being minimally invasive, reduced intraoperative blood loss and easier access to lymph nodes compared with LATG. Totally laparoscopic gastrectomy is likely to be the surgical trend for gastric cancer in the future.

Although the number of drug-disease associations identified by high-throughput technologies is increasing, the experimental methods are time consuming and expensive. As supplement to them, many computational methods have been developed for an accurate in silico prediction for new drug-disease associations. In this work, we present a novel computational model combining sparse auto-encoder and rotation forest (SAEROF) to predict drug-disease association. Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, drug structure similarity and disease semantic similarity were extracted for exploring the association among drugs and diseases. On this basis, a rotation forest classifier based on sparse auto-encoder is proposed to predict the association between drugs and diseases. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we used it to implement 10-fold cross validation on two golden standard datasets, Fdataset and Cdataset. As a result, the proposed model achieved AUCs (Area Under the ROC Curve) of Fdataset and Cdataset are 0.9092 and 0.9323, respectively. For performance evaluation, we compared SAEROF with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier and some existing computational models. Three human diseases (Obesity, Stomach Neoplasms and Lung Neoplasms) were explored in case studies. As a result, more than half of the top 20 drugs predicted were successfully confirmed by the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database(CTD database). This model is a feasible and effective method to predict drug-disease correlation, and its performance is significantly improved compared with existing methods. Cytisine N-methylene-(5,7-dihydroxy-4\\'-methoxy)-isoflavone (CNF2) is a new compound isolated from the Chinese herbal medicine Sophora alopecuroides. Preliminary pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated its activity in inhibiting breast cancer cell metastasis. This study examined the pharmacokinetics, absolute bioavailability, and tissue distribution of CNF2 in rats, and combined computer-aided technology to predict the druggability of CNF2. The binding site of CNF2 and the breast cancer target human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) were examined with molecular docking technology. Next, ACD/Percepta software was used to predict the druggability of CNF2 based on the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). Finally, a simple and effective HPLC method was used to determine plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of CNF2 in rats. Prediction and experimental results show that compared with the positive control HER2 inhibitor SYR127063, CNF2 has a stronger binding affinity with HER2, suggesting that its efficacy is stronger; and the structure of CNF2 complies with the Lipinski\\'s Rule of Five and has good drug-likeness. The residence time of CNF2 in rats is less than 4\\u2009h, and the metabolic rate is relatively fast; But the absolute bioavailability of CNF2 in rats was 6.6%, mainly distributed in the stomach, intestine, and lung tissues, where the CNF2 contents were 401.20, 144.01, and 245.82\\u2009µg/g, respectively. This study constructed rapid screening and preliminary evaluation of active compounds, which provided important references for the development and further research of such compounds. None Objective The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of a serum screening system for predicting the risk of gastric cancer. Methods Serum pepsinogen I (PG I)/pepsinogen II (PG II) and Helicobacter pylori (HP) antibody levels were measured. Subjects were classified into four groupsaccording to their serological status (the ABC classification system). The grade of atrophic gastritis was assessed endoscopically. We evaluated gastric cancer detection rates according to the ABC classification system and the endoscopic grade of atrophy. Patients Individuals who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in a health check were prospectively enrolled in the present study. Results According to the ABC classification system, the gastric cancer detection rates in groups A, B, C, and D were 0.07% (4/6,105), 0.5% (8/1,739), 0.8% (16/2,010), and 1.1% (3/281), respectively. The gastric cancer detection rates in subjects with no atrophy, closed type (C-type) atrophy, and open type (O-type) atrophy were 0% (0/4,567), 0.2% (4/2,581), and 0.9% (27/2,987), respectively. In group A (HP(-)/PG(-)), the proportions of subjects with no atrophy, C-type atrophy, and O-type atrophy were 71.2%, 22.8%, and 6.0%, respectively. In group A, the gastric cancer detection rates in subjects with no atrophy, C-type atrophy, and O-type atrophy were 0%, 0.07%, and 0.8%, respectively. Conclusion The ABC classification system is useful for predicting the risk of gastric cancer. However, this system was limited in group A, which included individuals with a high risk of developing gastric cancer. An endoscopic diagnosis of atrophy may be more effective than the ABC classification system for predicting the risk of gastric cancer.   To investigate the protective effect and molecular mechanisms of Weining granule on N-methyl-N\\'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced gastric cancer in rats.\\nA total of sixty healthy male wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups, including control group (CG), gastric cancer model group (MG), low-dose Weining granule treated group (LWT), medium-dose Weining granule treated group (MWT), and high-dose Weining granule treated group (HWT). Except the control group, the other groups were treated with MNNG to establish a rat model of gastric cancer. Low-dose Weining granule treated group, medium-dose Weining granule treated group, and high-dose Weining granule treated group were fed 9.0, 18.0 and 36.0 g/kg Weining granule, respectively. Histopathologic and molecular biologic technology were adopted to determine the protective effect of Weining granule on MNNG-induced gastric cancer in rats. The pathological changes of gastrointestinal tissue were observed. Meanwhile, the differential expression of proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis markers were determined, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), pokemon, cyclin D1, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase-3, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\\nAfter the MNNG treated, the pathological changes of stomach tissue were improved noticeably, including the intestinal metaplasia and atypic hyperplasia. The experiment was completed in 58 rats (96.67%). As compared with gastric cancer model group, the general states of rats were improved significantly after treated with different dose Weining granule. Moreover, treatment with different doses of Weining granule could inhibit the protein and mRNA expression of PCNA, pokemon, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and VEGF, while increase caspase-3 and PTEN (P < 0.01).\\nWeining granule could improve gastric cancer by suppressing cell proliferation, promoting tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibiting angiogenesis. To evaluate the effect of Wulong Xiaozheng Wan medicated serum on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of BGC823 cell induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and to explore its mechanism.\\nEMT model of BGC823 was stimulated by TGF-β1. Wulong Xiaozheng Wan medicated serum and LY-364947 were used as intervention. The proliferation and adhesion of BGC823 were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide and flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis. The invasion and migration were detected by Transwell. The level of matrix metalloproteins was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions of related proteins and mRNA of EMT marker and TGF-β1/Smad signal pathway were detected by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\\nCompared with the TGF-β1 group, Wulong Xiaozheng Wan medicated serum could inhibit the ability of proliferation, heterogeneous adhesion, invasion, and migration. It also promotes apoptosis and homotypic adhesion in BGC823, with a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, Wulong Xiaozheng Wan medicated serum could regulate the expression of related proteins and mRNA of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, and inhibit the expressions of EMT transcription factors and EMT markers.\\nWulong Xiaozheng Wan medicated serum inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition by down-regulated the expression of TβRI and the activation of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. Size, ulcer, differentiation, and location are known to be factors affecting the T stage accuracy of EUS in gastric cancer. However, whether an interaction exists among recognized variables is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the combinatorial characteristics of group with high overestimation rate to determine which group should be considered carefully for EUS-based treatment plans.\\nWe retrospectively analyzed early gastric cancer patients who underwent EUS from 2005 to 2016. The accuracy of EUS T stage and factors affecting over-/underestimation were examined by using decision tree analysis, the CHAID method.\\nThe most significant factor affecting the accuracy of the EUS T stage was the size. The rate of overestimation was higher in lesions\\u2009>\\u20093\\xa0cm (37.2% vs. 28.8% vs. 17.1%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In lesions\\u2009>\\u20093\\xa0cm, the rate of overestimation was higher in lesions with an ulcer (62.1% vs. 35.0%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Moreover, for lesions\\u2009≤\\u20093\\xa0cm, the accuracy of the EUS T stage was more affected by differentiation and location. The rate of overestimation was higher in undifferentiated-type lesions\\u2009≤\\u20092\\xa0cm (24.5% vs. 13.9%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and 2-3\\xa0cm (33.3% vs. 25.7%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.011). In the differentiated type, the location affected the accuracy of the EUS T stage.\\nIn this hierarchical analysis, the rate of overestimation was higher in lesions\\u2009>\\u20093\\xa0cm with ulcer, lesions\\u2009>\\u20093\\xa0cm irrespective of ulcer, and undifferentiated-type lesions measuring 2-3\\xa0cm. GC/MS coupled metabolomics analysis, using a simplified and much less expensive silylation process with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN), was conducted to investigate metabolic abnormalities in stomach cancer cells. Under optimized conditions for derivatization by TMSCN and methanol extraction, 228 metabolites were detected using GC/MS spectrometry analysis, and 89 metabolites were identified using standard compounds and the NIST database. Ten metabolite levels were found to be lower in stomach cancer cells relative to normal cells. Among those ten metabolites, four metabolites-ribose, proline, pyroglutamic acid, and glucose-were known to be linked to cancers. In particular, pyroglutamic acid level showed a drastic reduction of 22-fold in stomach cancer cells. Since glutamine and glutamic acid are known to undergo cyclization to pyroglutamic acid, the 22-fold reduction might be the actual reduction in the levels of glutamine and/or glutamic acid-both known to be cancer-related. Hence, the marked reduction in pyroglutamic acid level might serve as a biomarker to aid early detection of stomach cancer. Graphical abstract. siRNA-mediated polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) silencing has been proposed as a promising therapeutic method for multiple cancers. However, the clinic application of this method is still hindered by the low specific delivery of siPLK1 to desired tumor lesions. Herein, folate (FA)-modified and leucine-bearing polyethylenimine was successfully synthesized and showed excellent targeted silencing to folate receptor overexpressed cells.\\nThe condensation of siPLK1 by FA-N-Ac-L-Leu-PEI (NPF) was detected by the gel retardation assay. The targeted and silencing efficiency was evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscope. The PLK1 expressions at gene or protein levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting assay. Further impacts of the PLK1 silencing on cell viability, cell cycle, migration, and invasion were studied by MTT, colony formation, wound healing and transwell assays.\\nThe NPF and siPLK1 could efficiently assemble to stable nanoparticles at a weight ratio of 3.0 and showed excellent condensation and protection effect. Owing to the FA-mediated targeted delivery, the uptake and silencing efficiency of NPF/siPLK1 to SGC-7901 cells was higher than that without FA modification. Moreover, NPF-mediated PLK1 silencing showed significant antitumor activity in vitro. The anti-proliferation effect of PLK1 silencing was induced via the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis pathway with the cell cycle arrest of 45% at G2 phase and the apoptotic ratio of 28.3%.\\nFA-N-Ac-L-Leu-PEI (NPF) could generate targeted delivery siPLK1 to FA receptor overexpressed cells and dramatically downregulate the expression of PLK1 expression. Menetrier\\'s disease is a rare acquired disorder associated with giant gastric folds along with protein-losing enteropathy, hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, and histologic features of massive foveolar hyperplasia. Little is known about the etiology, clinical features, or epidemiology of this disorder, including risk of gastric cancer. We investigated the outcomes and characteristics of patients with Menetrier\\'s disease, including development of gastric cancer and survival times.\\nWe performed a case-control study of all Menetrier\\'s disease cases (n\\xa0= 76; mean age, 56 ± 45 y; 59% male; mean body mass index, 24) diagnosed at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from January 1975 through 2005. Diagnosis of Menetrier\\'s disease was based on a combination of clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic features. Patients with dyspepsia who underwent gastric biopsy analysis were included as controls. We obtained demographic, clinical history, laboratory, imaging, histopathology, and follow-up data from medical records. Clinical characteristics of Menetrier\\'s disease were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival in cases.\\nClinical features found in a significantly higher proportion of patients with Menetrier\\'s disease than controls included vomiting, abdominal pain, postprandial fullness, and weight loss of 10 lb or more. Smoking was associated with Menetrier\\'s disease (P\\xa0= .002 vs controls), but not alcohol use. Infection with Helicobacter pylori was not associated with Menetrier\\'s disease (2.6% of patients vs 4.0% of controls; P\\xa0= 1.00). There was no significant difference between patients with Menetrier\\'s disease vs controls in proportions with inflammatory bowel disease. Gastric cancer developed in 8.9% of patients with Menetrier\\'s disease by 10 years after the Menetrier\\'s disease diagnosis vs 3.7% of controls over the same time period (P\\xa0= .09). Of patients with Menetrier\\'s disease, 72.7% and 65.0% survived for 5 and 10 years, respectively, compared with 100% of controls (P < .0001 for both time periods).\\nIn a case-control study of 76 patients with Menetrier\\'s disease, we found this rare disorder to be associated with increased mortality. Patients with Menetrier\\'s disease therefore should be followed up with surveillance endoscopy. Even though treatment modalities such as adjuvant systemic radio-chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have individually have improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates in advanced Gastric Cancer (AGC), the peritoneum still presides as a common site of treatment failure and disease recurrence. The role of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been acknowledged as prophylaxis for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) in AGC patients and in this study, we aim at investigating the safety and efficacy of the combination of neoadjuvant laparoscopic HIPEC (NLHIPEC) with NAC in the neoadjuvant phase followed by surgery of curative intent with intraoperative HIPEC followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (AC).\\nIn this multicenter Phase III randomized controlled trial, 326 patients will be randomly separated into 2 groups into a 1:1 ratio after laparoscopic exploration. The experiment arm will receive the proposed comprehensive Dragon II regimen while the control group will undergo standard R0 D2 followed by 8\\u2009cycles of AC with oxaliplatin with S-1 (SOX) regimen. The Dragon II regimen comprises of 1 cycle of NLHIPEC for 60mins at 43\\u2009±\\u20090.5\\u2009°C with 80\\u2009mg/m\\nThis study is one of the first to combine NLHIPEC with NAC in the preoperative phase which is speculated to provide local management of occult peritoneal carcinomatosis or peritoneal free cancer cells while NAC will promote tumor downsizing and down-staging. The addition of the intraoperative HIPEC is speculated to manage dissemination due to surgical trauma. Where the roles of intraoperative HIPEC and NAC have individually been investigated, this study provides innovative insight on a more comprehensive approach to management of AGC at high risk of peritoneal recurrence. It is expected that the combination of NLHIPEC with NAC and HIPEC will increase PFS by 15% and decrease PMR after gastrectomy of curative intent.\\nWorld Health Organization Clinical Trials - International Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) with Registration ID ChiCTR1900024552, Registered Prospectively on the 16th July, 2019. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) allows removing neoplastic lesions on gastric mucosa, including early gastric cancer (EGC) and dysplasia. Data on ESD from Western countries are still scanty. We report results of ESD procedures performed in Italy. Data of consecutive patients who underwent ESD for gastric neoplastic removal were analyzed. The  The present study sought to evaluate host-related factors as predictors in patients receiving chemotherapy for recurrent advanced gastric cancer.\\nSixty-three patients were enrolled in the study and received chemotherapy for recurrent gastric cancer at the Kochi Medical School from 2008 to 2015. Clinicopathological information and systemic inflammatory response data were obtained retrospectively to investigate associations between baseline cancer-related prognostic variables and survival outcomes.\\nThe median survival time was significantly higher for patients with a Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) of 0 compared to a GPS of 1 or 2 (18.2 vs. 7.1 months; p = 0.006), and for patients in the normal range for carbohydrate antigen-125 (CA125) compared to higher levels (17.9 vs. 4.1 months; p = 0.003). There was no significant influence on overall survival by age, gender, disease status, metastatic site, time to recurrence, carcinoembryonic antigen level, CA19-9 level, prognostic nutrition index, or neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio according to the results of the univariate log-rank tests. Multivariate survival analysis identified a GPS of 1 or 2 (hazard ratio, 3.520; 95% confidence interval, 1.343-9.227; p = 0.010) and a high CA125 level (hazard ratio, 3.135; 95% confidence interval, 1.276-7.697; p = 0.013) as significant independent predictors associated with a poorer prognosis in the studied group of cancer patients.\\nA GPS of 1 or 2 and a high level of CA125 are independent predictors of a poorer prognosis in patients receiving chemotherapy for recurrent gastric cancer. Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, and mortality rates are still high. Primary preventive strategies, aimed to reduce risk factors and promote protective ones, will lead to a decrease in GC incidence. Helicobacter pylori infection is a well-established carcinogen for GC, and its eradication is recommended as the best strategy for the primary prevention. However, the role of other factors such as lifestyle, diet, and drug use is still under debate in GC carcinogenesis. Unfortunately, most patients with GC are diagnosed at late stages when treatment is often ineffective. Neoplastic transformation of the gastric mucosa is a multistep process, and appropriate diagnosis and management of preneoplastic conditions can reduce GC-related mortality. Several screening strategies in relation to GC incidence have been proposed in order to detect neoplastic lesions at early stages. The efficacy of screening strategies in reducing GC mortality needs to be confirmed. This review provides an overview of current international guidelines and recent literature on primary and secondary prevention strategies for GC. Additional surgery is recommended for patients with noncurative resection after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer. Additional resection requires the excision of an area larger than that of the resected mucosa in ESD, which is larger than the lesion, with convergence of the gastric mucosa due to scarring. Thus, the selection of the surgical procedure for lesion removal in specific areas can be affected by ESD. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the impact of ESD on the selection of additional gastrectomy in patients with early gastric cancer in the boundary area between the upper third and middle third of the stomach (UM boundary region).\\nBetween January 2013 and June 2018, laparoscopic gastrectomy was performed in 89 patients with cT1N0M0 gastric cancer located only in the UM boundary region. The patients\\' backgrounds and surgical and pathological results were retrospectively investigated. The predictive factors for performing laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) were evaluated by multivariate analysis.\\nAmong 89 patients, 23 patients underwent ESD before surgery. LDG was significantly less often performed in the ESD-surgery group than in the surgery-only group (34.8% vs. 72.7%; p\\u2009=\\u20090.003). Preoperative ESD was an independent negative predictor of LDG (odds ratio\\u2009=\\u20090.266; p\\u2009=\\u20090.025).\\nPreoperative ESD has an impact on the selection of the type of additional gastrectomy, including reducing the conduct of LDG for early gastric cancer in the UM boundary region. Synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach accompanied by liver metastasis is rare. It is often difficult to determine an appropriate treatment strategy for multiple liver metastases of synchronous gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Multidisciplinary treatment is required based on the progression and location of each tumor and chemotherapy for complete resection.\\nA 57-year-old male who complained of acute abdominal pain and fever visited his local hospital. He underwent emergent surgery for peritonitis caused by a gastric perforation. The cytodiagnosis of ascites did not show any tumor cells. There was a liver metastasis in the lateral segment of the liver. We performed a primary closure of the defect and then applied an omentum flap. After surgery, the patient was diagnosed as having synchronous cStage IV transverse colon cancer with multiple liver metastases and cStage IIB gastric cancer. The [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed 18F-FDG uptake by the colon tumor and multiple liver metastases, but there was no uptake in the gastric tumor or lymph nodes. We retrospectively reevaluated the CT findings from a local hospital and detected a liver nodule in segment 2/3 (from 35 to 60 mm) and segment 6 (from 26 to 57 mm), and the tumors had dramatically grown in size in only 2 months. Because complete tumor resection would be difficult, S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) plus bevacizumab therapy was started to control tumor progression. After 20 courses of chemotherapy, the clinical diagnosis was ycStage IV transverse colon cancer and ycStage IIa gastric cancer. We planned a two-step procedure to completely resect the primary tumors and multiple liver metastases. We first performed a laparoscopic right-colon resection+D3 lymphadenectomy and open distal gastrectomy+D2 lymphadenectomy. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 18. After 1 month, we performed open liver resection. The pathological findings showed that the transverse colon was ypT2 (MP) with grade 2 therapeutic effects and that there were no atypical cells in the gastric tumor and multiple liver nodules (pathological complete response).\\nThe SOX plus bevacizumab regimen could be an option for controlling tumor progression in synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach with liver metastasis and led to the complete resection of such tumors. Reduced pancreas volume, as measured by non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is observed in individuals with newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D) and declines over the first year after diagnosis. In this study, we determined the repeatability and inter-reader reproducibility of pancreas volume measurements by MRI. Test-retest scans in individuals with or without T1D (n\\u2009=\\u200916) had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.985 (95% CI 0.961 to 0.995) for pancreas volume. Independent pancreas outlines by two board-certified radiologists (n\\u2009=\\u200930) yielded an ICC of 0.945 (95% CI 0.889 to 0.973). The mean Dice coefficient, a measurement of the degree of overlap between pancreas regions of interest between the two readers, was 0.77. Prandial state did not influence pancreatic measurements, as stomach volume did not correlate with pancreas volume. These data demonstrate that MRI measurements of pancreas volume between two readers are repeatable and reproducible with ICCs that correspond to excellent clinical significance (ICC\\u2009>\\u20090.9), are not related to changes in stomach volume, and could be a useful tool for clinical investigation of diabetes and other pancreas pathologies. Evidence suggest that diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are associated with cancer risk. However, previous studies have been limited variably by failure to adjust for cancer-specific risk factors (e.g., body mass index), inattention to diabetes duration and use of antidiabetic medications, and failure to stratify by obesity.\\nWe examined the association between diabetes, HbA1c, and cancer risk in the UK Biobank, using data from 476,517 participants (54% women), followed for an average period of 7.1 years. Diabetes was defined on the basis of baseline self-reported diagnosis of diabetes and/or use of diabetes medication, while HbA1c measured at baseline was categorized as low (<31 mmol/mol), normal (31-<39 mmol/mol), increased risk (39-<48 mmol/mol), and high risk for diabetes (≥48 mmol/mol). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association of diabetes and cancer at different anatomical sites, with adjustment for cancer-specific risk factors.\\nDiabetes was associated with increased risk of cancers of the stomach, liver, bladder, endometrium, and lung among smokers, and with decreased risk of prostate cancer. Compared with the normal HbA1c category, the increased risk category was positively associated with risk of cancers of the colon, liver, bladder, and lung among smokers, and the high-risk category was associated with increased risk of cancers of the esophagus, liver, pancreas, and bladder, and with decreased risk of prostate cancer.\\nThese results suggest that both diabetes and/or elevated HbA1c are associated with risk of cancer at several anatomic sites.\\nThe associations of diabetes and HbA1c levels with cancer suggest their importance in cancer prevention. Information on the association between long-term exposure to PM\\nThis study investigated the association between long-term exposure to PM\\nA total of 385,650 Taiwanese adults (≥18\\xa0years old) jointed a standard medical examination program between 2001 and 2014 and were followed up until 2016. Their vital data were obtained from the National Death Registry maintained by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan. We estimated the ambient PM\\nWe found that each 10\\xa0µg/m\\nLong-term exposure to ambient PM This study aimed to report the projected cancer incidence and mortality for the year 2020 to estimate Korea\\'s current cancer burden.\\nCancer incidence data from 1999 to 2017 were obtained from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, and cancer mortality data from 1993 to 2018 were acquired from Statistics Korea. Cancer incidence and mortality were projected by fitting a linear regression model to observed age-specific cancer rates against observed years and then by multiplying the projected age-specific rates by the age-specific population. A Joinpoint regression model was used to determine the year in which the linear trend changed significantly; we only used the data of the latest trend.\\nIn total, 243,263 new cancer cases and 80,546 cancer deaths are expected to occur in Korea in 2020. The most common cancer site is expected to be the lung, followed by the stomach, thyroid, colon/rectum, and breast. These five cancers types are expected to represent half of the overall burden of cancer in Korea. The most common type of cancer among people who die is expected to be lung cancer, followed by liver, colon/rectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers.\\nThe incidence rates for all types of cancer in Korea are estimated to decrease gradually. These up-to-date estimates of the cancer burden in Korea could be an important resource for planning and evaluating cancer-control programs. Patients with primary gastric lymphoma are at an increased risk of developing gastric cancer. Data on gastric precancerous lesions development in these patients are scanty. We assessed gastric precancerous lesions in a cohort of patients with primary lymphoma.\\nData of patients with primary gastric lymphoma [mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)- lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)] were analysed. Multiple (>10) biopsies were performed on gastric mucosa at each endoscopic control, beyond macroscopic lesions. Presence and distribution of intestinal metaplasia (IM) at baseline, the onset at follow-up, and progression through the stomach or transformation in the incomplete IM type were assessed. The onset of neoplastic lesions was recorded.\\nData of 50 patients (mean age of 63.6 ± 10.7 years; M/F: 25/25), including 40 with MALT-lymphoma and 10 with DLBCL, with median follow-up of 30.5 months (range: 9-108) and a median of 6 endoscopic controls (range: 3-14) were evaluated. At entry, IM was present in 12 (24%), and it developed in other 22 (57.9%) patients at a median follow-up of 6 (range: 3-40) months. Overall, progression of IM was observed in 7 (21.2%) cases, including extension in the stomach (n=5) or transformation into the incomplete type (n=2). Low-grade dysplasia was detected in 4, and indefinite dysplasia in other 7 patients. In one patient, low-grade dysplasia had progressed to high-grade and gastric adenocarcinoma of the fundus.\\nOur data found a frequent onset and rapid progression of precancerous lesions on gastric mucosa of lymphoma patients. This observation could explain the increased incidence of metachronous gastric cancer in these patients. Elemene is a natural compound extracted from Zingiberaceae plants, and is used in various cancer. However, the efficacy and safety elemene combined with chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (GC) are lack of systematic assessment.\\nwe searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China Academic Journals (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Journals (CQVIP) and Chinese Biomedical Literature databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing elemene plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in participants with advanced GC and reporting at least one of the following outcomes were selected and assessed for inclusion. JADAD scale was used to assess the quality. Data was screened and extracted by two independent investigators. The primary clinical outcome was overall response rate (ORR); the secondary outcomes were quality of life (QOL) and adverse events (AEs). Analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3.\\nSixteen RCTs matched the selection criteria, which reported on 969 subjects. Risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for ORR, life quality based on KPS, and risk of AEs. Compared to chemotherapy alone, elemene combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of GC may increase the efficiency of ORR(RR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.23-1.60; P\\u200a<\\u200a.0001), improve their life quality based on KPS (RR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.45-2.34; P\\u200a<\\u200a.00001), and reduce the adverse reactions, including leukopenia(RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62-0.85; P\\u200a<\\u200a.00001), neutropenia (RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60-0.95; P\\u200a=\\u200a.02), anemia (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60-0.95; P\\u200a=\\u200a.02), thrombocytopenia (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.43-0.73; P\\u200a<\\u200a.00001). Nausea and vomiting (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.84-1.07; P\\u200a=\\u200a.39), diarrhea (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.41-1.15; P\\u200a=\\u200a.15), neurotoxicity (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59-1.00; P\\u200a=\\u200a.05) and hepatic dysfunction (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.58-1.54; P\\u200a=\\u200a.83) were similar between two groups.\\nElemene may have the potential to improve the efficacy and reduce the AEs of chemotherapy for gastric cancer. However, the long-term, high-quality researches with a large sample size in different populations are required. Numerous studies have investigated the association between pretreatment serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but conclusions remain controversial. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to assess systematically the relationship between ALP and prognosis in HCC.\\nWe searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases for eligible studies up to October. A combined hazard ratio (HR) was determined to describe the correlation between pretreatment serum ALP level and prognosis in HCC patients. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of treatment either to the end point of the follow-up period or to the date of death by any cause. Disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were defined as the period from the date of treatment to the date of last follow-up or to the date of recurrence. OS was regarded as the major outcome.\\nAltogether, 21 studies about OS and 6 studies about DFS/RFS were included in this meta-analysis. Our combined results showed that there was an inverse association of pretreatment serum ALP level with OS (HR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.12-1.19) and RFS (HR=1.78, 95% CI: 1.37-2.31).\\nThere was a close association between high pretreatment ALP level and poor survival in HCC patients, indicating that ALP may be used as a biomarker for prognosis. More high-quality studies are required to validate our findings further, considering the limitations of our meta-analysis. To explore the role of preoperative prealbumin levels in predicting the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.\\nA total of 989 gastric cancer patients in the Affiliated Tumour Hospital of Harbin Medical University who underwent gastrectomy were included in this retrospective study. The preoperative prealbumin level, clinicopathological data, and follow-up data were recorded. According to the maximum chi-square survival correlation value, the survival of patients with low preoperative prealbumin (<140\\u200amg/L) and high preoperative prealbumin (≥140\\u200amg/L) were compared using the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazard regression model.\\nBased on the best cut-off value of 140\\u200amg/L, we divided the patients into the lower prealbumin group (<140\\u200amg/L) and the higher prealbumin group (≥140\\u200amg/L). Compared with the higher prealbumin group, the lower prealbumin group were older and had larger tumor volumes, lower hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and more upper gastric cancer tumors. The univariate analysis showed that prealbumin and other clinicopathological factors, including age, hemoglobin, tumor size, macroscopic type, cell differentiation, liver metastasis, operation type, N stage, and T stage, were significant prognostic factors. The multivariable analysis showed that age, prealbumin, macroscopic type, location, T stage, and N stage were independent prognostic factors.\\nThe preoperative prealbumin level was an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. The preoperative prealbumin level can be used to predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer and guide clinical practice. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer (EGC) is performed safely and effectively in elderly patients; however, whether ESD for EGC in elderly patients with frailty is safe and improves prognosis remains unclear.\\nIn total, 142 patients aged ≥80\\u2009years who underwent ESD for EGC between September 2008 and September 2014 were included. We compared outcomes between patients with frailty and those without frailty. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on a patient\\'s status before admission. Study endpoints were short- and long-term clinical outcomes after ESD.\\nPatients were allocated into two groups: no frailty (CFS 1-3, n = 101) versus frailty (CFS 4-7, n = 41). Short-term clinical outcomes, specifically, adverse events and curability, did not differ between the two groups. For the long-term clinical outcomes, patients with frailty had significantly worse outcomes after ESD than those without frailty (the 3-year overall survival rates were 73.2% vs. 93.1%; P\\u2009<\\u20090.001 with log-rank test). The Cox proportional hazards model showed that frailty was only an independent risk factor for poor prognosis.\\nESD for EGC is safe for elderly patients with or without frailty. However, elderly patients with frailty have a significantly poorer prognosis than those without frailty after ESD. Our results indicate that the frailty evaluation may be helpful to determine whether ESD for EGC should be performed. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 461-466. Fentanyl is a drug commonly used for perioperative and postoperative analgesia. Previous studies have confirmed that fentanyl can affect the progression of gastric cancer; however, this effect has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of our study was thus to investigate the role of fentanyl in gastric cancer and clarify its potential mechanisms.\\nA CCK-8 assay was used to determine the proliferation of MGC-803 cells, while Transwell assay and wound healing assay were used to determine the invasion and migration abilities, respectively. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry, and the ultrastructure of the cells was examined with a transmission electron microscope. The mRNA expression levels of serine-threonine protein kinase 1 (Akt-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) were evaluated by real-time (RT) quantitative PCR. The protein expression of p-Akt, MMP-9, and caspase-9 was detected by western blot analysis. To study the interaction of fentanyl with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/MMP-9 pathway, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and MMP-9 inhibitor (SB-3CT) were used to treat the MGC-803 cells.\\nFindings indicated that fentanyl inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration of MGC-803 cells. Specifically, fentanyl inhibits the expression of MMP-9 and enhances the expression of apoptosis-promoting factors such as caspase-9 and DAPK1 through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Cell cycle arrest was observed in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/MMP-9 by LY294002 and SB-3CT enhanced the anticancer effects of fentanyl.\\nFentanyl inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/MMP-9 pathway, which could be very useful for gastric cancer treatment. In the past, there were not a lot of studies on how A-kinase anchor protein 5 (AKAP5) involving in the pathogenesis and prognosis of non-mucin producing stomach adenocarcinoma (NMSA). Therefore, we studied the relationship between AKAP5 and the prognosis of NMSA and its possible mechanisms using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\\nRNA high-throughput sequencing and clinicopathologic data of NMSA were downloaded from the TCGA. Clinical pathologic features associated with AKAP5 expression were analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher exact tests. The relationship between the overall survival (OS) and AKAP5 expression was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox regression analysis. GSEA analysis was performed using the TCGA dataset.\\nOur results indicated that the AKAP5 expression was increased in NMSA (all tumor \\nLow expression of AKAP5 may be a potential molecular marker for predicting poor prognosis of NMSA. Besides, cholesterol homeostasis, glycolysis, estrogen response, adipogenesis, notch signaling, and peroxisome may be the key pathways regulated by AKAP5 in NMSA. It also suggested that AKAP5 might potentially have biological functions in the development of stomach adenocarcinoma. Digestive cancers-including gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer-accounted for 26% of cancer cases and 35% of cancer deaths worldwide in 2018. It is crucial and urgent to develop biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic benefits of digestive cancers, especially for GC, since the incidence of GC is lower only than lung cancer in China, is hard to detect at an early stage, and is associated with poor prognosis. Mucins, glycoproteins encoded by MUC family genes, act as a part of a physical barrier in the digestive tract and participate in various signaling pathways. Some mucins have been used or proposed as biomarkers for carcinomas, such as MUC16 (CA125) and MUC4. However, there are no systematic investigations on the association of MUC family members with diagnoses and clinical outcomes even though relevant data have been largely accumulated in the past decade. By analyzing transcriptomic and clinical data of digestive cancer samples from TCGA involving colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), it was found that expressions levels of  Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) plays an essential role in the treatment of esophageal cancer as either curative or neoadjuvant therapy. When delivered with conventional photon-based techniques, multiple adjacent organs at risk including the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, stomach, and bowel, receive considerable radiation dose which may contribute to acute and late adverse events (AEs). Proton beam therapy (PBT) offers a reduction in radiation exposure to these organs and potentially an improvement in the therapeutic ratio. Herein we discuss the emerging role of PBT for esophageal cancer, including rationale, treatment planning, early dosimetric and clinical comparisons of PBT with photon-based techniques, ongoing prospective trials, and potential areas of opportunity for the incorporation of PBT with the goal of improving outcomes for patients with esophageal cancer. There are no studies on the trend of gastric cancer (GC) incidence in Kurdistan, a province in the west of Iran. We aimed to estimate the trend, age-standardized incidence rate (ASR), and annual percentage change (APC) of GC in this province during 2001-2014.\\nThe data of newly diagnosed GC patients were obtained from the regional Cancer Registering Database. The ASRs were calculated per 100,000 population during 2001-2014. Direct standardization and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by an efficient method. The temporary changes in ASRs were determined based on the APC by the joinpoint regression model.\\nOverall, 2225 newly diagnosed GC patients were identified. The ASRs ranged from 13.5 (95% CI: 10.4-17.3) to 29.0 (95% CI: 24.5-34.0). The highest ASRs were related to the men and women lived in Divandareh as 32.26 and 13.66, respectively. The respective APC value of GC incidence in women demonstrated a nonsignificant increase during 2001-2008 and a nonsignificant decrease during 2008-2014 (\\nThe incidence of GC showed nonsignificant and significant decreasing trends in women and men in Kurdistan province, respectively. Despite such decreasing trends, the Kurdistan province is still considered as one of the regions with high incidence of GC in Iran. Therefore, it is necessary to implement screening programs in the province to early diagnose GC. None Gastric cancer (GC) is responsible for high morbidity and mortality worldwide. This cancer claims fifth place among other cancers. There are a number of factors associated with GC development such as alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking. It seems that genetic factors play significant role in GC malignancy and progression. MicroRNAs (miRs) are short non-coding RNA molecules with negative impact on the expression of target genes. A variety of studies have elucidated the potential role of miRs in GC growth. Investigation of molecular pathways has revealed that miRs function as upstream modulators of Wnt signaling pathway. This signaling pathway involves in important biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, and its dysregulation is associated with GC invasion. At the present review, we demonstrate that how miRs regulate Wnt signaling pathway in GC malignancy. None Gastric cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease which is the fourth prevalent malignancy worldwide. Although, several diagnosis and treatment are available for the gastric cancer patients, however the malignancy is still the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Beside the genetic and environmental factors, epigenetic alterations are also involved in the emergence of gastric cancer. Epigenetics alterations are heritable changes which regulate gene expression without occurring changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic changes mostly include DNA methylation, histon post-translational modifications, chromatin remodeling and non-coding RNAs. Among the mentioned epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation is a major epigenetic process that plays a key role in different stages of evolution and cancer development. In this review, we address all types of related epigenetic modifications in gastric cancer by focus on DNA methylation by reviewing the recent literatures. Understanding of molecular mechanisms of epigenetics alterations in gastric cancer development helps researchers to identify new epigenetic drugs against the malignancy. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene is involved in repairing DNA lesions and maintaining genome stability, which is related to cancer invasion and metastasis. This gene influences the risk of cancers. Many studies have demonstrated that the ATM rs189037 G>A polymorphism is linked with the risks of different types of cancer. However, no study has probed the relationship between the ATM rs189037 G>A polymorphism and gastric cancer (GC) risk. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the association of the ATM rs189037 G>A polymorphism with the risk and prognosis of GC in a case-control investigation of 345 GC patients and 467 controls in China. The rs189037 G>A polymorphism was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. This polymorphism was related to a significantly higher risk of GC [AA vs. GG: OR (95% CI): 1.80 (1.20-2.70), P\\xa0=\\xa00.04; GG vs. AA\\xa0+\\xa0GA: 1.46 (1.08-1.98); A vs. G: 1.34 (1.10-1.64), P\\xa0=\\xa00.004]. Subgroup analyses showed significant associations with female gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, age ≥60\\xa0years, and positive Helicobacter pylori status. This polymorphism was also correlated with TNM stage III\\xa0+\\xa0IV and tumor size >4\\xa0cm. GC patients carrying the AA genotype of the rs189037 polymorphism also had lower overall survival. In conclusion, the ATM rs189037 G>A polymorphism was related to increased susceptibility to and poorer prognosis in GC in this Chinese population. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) is a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by benign growth of the hair follicles, the presence of pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and bilateral renal tumors that are usually hybrid oncocytic or multifocal chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a pathogenic variant in the tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) gene mapped at 17p11.2. Although the dermatological lesions typical of BHDS are benign and only cause aesthetic concerns, and the pulmonary manifestations are controllable, the greater tendency of patients with this syndrome to present benign or malignant renal tumors, often bilateral and multifocal, makes the diagnosis of this syndrome important for the prognosis of the patients. The objective was to report the case of a patient with BHDS, without pulmonary manifestations and with hyperplastic polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract, and to perform a literature review.\\nA 60-year-old man complained of abdominal pain and diarrhoea for 2\\u2009months. Physical examination was normal except for the presence of normochromic papules in the frontal region of the face associated with hyperkeratotic and hyperchromic papules in the dorsal region. The excisional biopsies of the skin lesions indicated trichodiscomas. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, enteroscopy, and colonoscopy showed the presence of hyperplastic polyps in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, colon, and rectum. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed multiple expansive solid lesions in both kidneys, with necrotic and calcified areas. Renal magnetic resonance angiography also showed a solid lesion in the right kidney measuring 5\\u2009cm in diameter and another solid lesion in the left kidney measuring 8\\u2009cm in diameter, both suggestive of renal angiomyolipoma. CT scans of the skull, chest, and temporal bones were normal. The genetic study revealed the presence of a variant of FLCN in the intron 13.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of BHDS with the simultaneous finding of gastrointestinal hyperplastic polyposis, which may represent a possible phenotypic expression of this syndrome that has not yet been described. To investigate the nationwide time trends in incidence and survival of oesophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas according to the Laurén classification (intestinal, diffuse and mixed type).\\nAll patients diagnosed in the Netherlands with oesophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma between 1989 and 2015 were included. A syntax was developed to determine the histological subtype based on pathology reports as archived in the Dutch pathology registry. These reports were linked to individual data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Relative survival was used to assess survival.\\nThe histological subtype could be determined in 18.691 (84.1%) oesophageal and in 32.312 (83.5%) gastric adenocarcinomas. Among these, 79% were intestinal and 21% diffuse type in oesophageal cancers, compared to 55% intestinal and 44% diffuse type in gastric cancers. Relative median survival of intestinal type tumours was longer than that of diffuse type tumours, that is, 12.1 versus 9.4 months for oesophageal carcinomas, and 10.1 versus 7.6 months for gastric carcinomas, respectively. Between 1989 and 2015, the relative median survival of non-metastatic intestinal and diffuse type oesophageal adenocarcinoma improved from 12.0 to 30.0 months, and from 12.0 to 19.2 months, respectively. The same was true for intestinal type gastric carcinoma (from 22.8 to 27.6 months) but for diffuse type gastric carcinoma, the increase was less (from 16.8 to 18.0 months).\\nIn this nationwide study, histological subtypes of oesophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas differed in incidence and survival times. These findings may call for a differentiated treatment approach. As one of the most prevalent infections globally, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) continues to present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for clinicians worldwide. Diagnostically, the \"test-and-treat\" strategy is the recommended approach for healthcare practitioners when managing this potentially curable disease. The choice of testing method should be based on several factors including patient age, presenting symptoms, and medication use, as well as test reliability, availability, and cost. With rising antibiotic resistance, particularly of macrolides, care must be taken to ensure that therapy is selected based on regional resistance patterns and prior antibiotic exposure. In the USA, macrolide antibiotic resistance rates in some areas have reached or exceeded a generally accepted threshold, such that clarithromycin triple therapy may no longer be an appropriate first-line empiric treatment. Instead, bismuth quadruple therapy should be considered, while levofloxacin-based or alternative macrolide-containing therapies are also options. Once treated, it is essential to test for eradication as untreated H. pylori is associated with serious complications including peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. This review article aims to consolidate current knowledge of H. pylori infection with a particular emphasis on diagnostic and treatment strategies. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumour patients generally have a better prognosis than microsatellite-stable (MSS) ones due to the large number of non-synonymous mutations. However, an increasing number of studies have revealed that less than half of MSI-H patients gain survival benefits or symptom alleviation from immune checkpoint-blockade treatment. Thus, an in-depth inspection of heterogeneous MSI-H tumours is urgently required.\\nHere, we used non-negative matrix factorisation (non-NMF)-based consensus clustering to define stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) MSI-H subtypes in samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and an Asian cohort, GSE62254.\\nMSI-H STAD samples are basically clustered into two subgroups (MSI-H1 and MSI-H2). Further examination of the immune landscape showed that immune suppression factors were enriched in the MSI-H1 subgroup, which may be associated with the poor prognosis in this subgroup.\\nOur results illustrate the genetic heterogeneity within MSI-H STADs, with important implications for cancer patient risk stratification, prognosis and treatment. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the role of  In a gastric cancer (GC) setting, phase II and III studies refer to an ideal patient population and only describe a specific category of patients. Older patients or those in poorer clinical condition are generally excluded from clinical trials. We aimed to evaluate therapeutic approaches to GC in a real-world setting at our institute (Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori [IRST] IRCCS) over a 10-year period.\\nA total of 621 consecutive patients with GC diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2009 were considered retrospectively. Among these, 573 with available information on stage of disease were included in the analysis. Demographic and clinical data were collected from paper or electronic medical records.\\nDuring the study period, 343 (59.8%) patients were diagnosed with GC stage 0 to IIIC (M0): of these, 118 patients had a relapse of disease. A total of 230 patients (40.2%) presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Older age was associated with less frequent administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.91); interaction between age and period (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03) and stage of disease at diagnosis (OR, 7.95; 95% CI, 3.71-17.1) were positively associated with administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Older age (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.90) and presence of comorbidity (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.83) were associated with less frequent administration of palliative chemotherapy, whereas from 2000-2004 to 2005-2009, patients were more frequently treated with palliative chemotherapy overall (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 2.01-6.81).\\nOur results confirm that resection is the standard surgical approach to GC, and that chemotherapy is not widely used in adjuvant and metastatic settings. Older age and comorbidities are associated with nontreatment. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was reported to be associated with gastric carcinogenesis. Resistin-like molecule beta (RELMβ), a recently described goblet cell-specific protein, was demonstrated to aberrantly express in gastric cancer and correlated with its clinicopathological features. This study aimed to examine the association between H. pylori and RELMβ expression in gastric carcinoma and precursor lesions. H. pylori infection and RELMβ expression were immunohistochemically evaluated in gastric biopsies from 230 patients. The biopsies consisted of normal gastric mucosa (n=20), mucosa with chronic gastritis (n=41), intestinal metaplasia (n=42), dysplasia (n=31), intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (n=56), and diffuse-type adenocarcinoma (n=40). RELMβ expression was measured in gastric biopsies after H. pylori eradication therapy in a subgroup of 32 patients. Cultured gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901 was infected with H. pylori strains, and RELMβ expression was detected by reverse transcription PCR, real-time PCR and Western blotting. Higher RELMβ immunoreactivity was observed in H. pylori-positive intestinal metaplasia (P=0.003), dysplasia (P=0.032), intestinal-type (P=0.037) and diffuse-type adenocarcinomas (P=0.001) than in H. pylori-negative specimens. Expression rates of RELMβ in dysplasia (P=0.005), intestinal-type adenocarcinoma (P<0.001), and diffuse-type adenocarcinoma (P=0.001) were significantly correlated with the grade of H. pylori density. In addition, H. pylori eradication reduced the RELMβ intensity in intestinal metaplasia (P=0.001). Infection of gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells with cag pathogenicity island (PAI)-positive H. pylori TN2, but not with its PAI totally deleted mutant (TN2-ΔPAI) for 4-8 h, resulted in enhanced protein and transcript levels of RELMβ (P<0.05). In summary, our study suggested that H. pylori infection facilitated the expression of RELMβ in gastric garcinoma and precursor lesions. SPARC is a cysteine-rich acidic secreted protein. It is a non-collagen component of bone, which is widely distributed in humans and animals and plays an important role. SPARC has been found in a variety of human cancers (breast cancer, stomach cancer, ovarian cancer, etc.) and diabetes-related research. Especially the muscle and fat metabolism are closely related. In this study, we used a DNA pool to detect a new SNP site (g.12454T\\u202f  The clinical success demonstrates the enormous potential of immunotherapy in cancer treatment.\\nThis article presented research linking gastric cancer to immune cells, based on RNA-seq data of Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and gene expression profile of GSE84437, 24 kinds of tumor-infiltrating immune cells were quantified by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis.\\nTh2 cells, T helper cells, and Mast cells were identified as prognostic immune cells in both TCGA and GEO groups. Then SUPV3L1 and SLC22A17 were identified as hub genes which may affect immune cell infiltration by correlation analysis. Survival analysis further proved that hub genes and prognostic immune cells are associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer. In gastrointestinal tumors, hub genes and prognostic immune cells also found differences in non-tumor and tumor tissues.\\nWe found that three immune cells infiltration are associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer and further identify two hub genes. These two key genes may affect immune cell infiltration, result in the different prognosis of patients. Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chronic atrophic gastritis and peptic ulcers and it has been associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). One of the more remarkable characteristics of H. pylori is its ability to survive in the hostile environment of the stomach. H. pylori regulates the expression of specific sets of genes allowing it to survive high acidity levels and nutrient scarcity. In the present study, we determined the expression of virulence associated protein D (VapD) of H. pylori inside adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cells and in gastric biopsies. Using qRT-PCR, VapD expression was quantified in intracellular H. pylori-AGS cell cultures at different time points and in gastric mucosa biopsies from patients suffering from chronic atrophic gastritis, follicular gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastritis precancerous intestinal metaplasia and adenocarcinoma. Our results show that vapD of H. pylori presented high transcription levels inside AGS cells, which increased up to two-fold above basal values across all assays over time. Inside AGS cells, H. pylori acquired a coccoid form that is metabolically active in expressing VapD as a protection mechanism, thereby maintaining its permanence in a viable non-cultivable state. VapD of H. pylori was expressed in all gastric biopsies, however, higher expression levels (p = 0.029) were observed in gastric antrum biopsies from patients with follicular gastritis. The highest VapD expression levels were found in both antrum and corpus gastric biopsies from older patients (>57 years old). We observed that VapD in H. pylori is a protein that is only produced in response to interactions with eukaryotic cells. Our results suggest that VapD contributes to the persistence of H. pylori inside the gastric epithelial cells, protecting the microorganism from the intracellular environment, reducing its growth rate, enabling long-term infection and treatment resistance. With the occurrence and improvement of immunohistochemistry and other pathological diagnostic techniques, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) has been gradually recognized. With the prolonged survival of patients with GISTs, reports about the bone metastasis of GIST increased. However, the knowledge of GISTs is rather limited due to its very low incidence.\\nCochrane and Medline database (via PubMed) were searched in July 2019 with related keywords to acquire the literature related to the bone metastasis of GIST. Then, the literature was reviewed and references were also scanned to identify the possible related reports. Study data comprising age, sex, primary location, metastasis interval time, immunohistochemistry index, management and prognosis were recorded and analyzed.\\nForty-five patients with bone metastases of GIST, with a mean age of 61.09 years, were included. The small intestine and stomach were the most common primary sites, followed by the rectum. Patients with small intestine primary sites had bone metastases that occurred earlier than the bone metastases stomach and rectum primary sites. The spine was the most common site of bony metastases. The mean survival time after GIST diagnosis was more than 64.02 months. Patients younger than 60 years old had a worse prognosis than those older than 60 years old. Furthermore, patients with spinal involvement had a worse prognosis than those without spinal involvement. Surgical interventions combined with targeted therapies guaranteed a better prognosis.\\nBone metastasis of GIST, which mainly occurs in the spine, is rather rare. Patients with GISTs of the small intestine and stomach suffered from bone metastasis more frequently and earlier than patients with GISTs in other primary sites. Age, sex, primary tumor location, treatment mode for the primary lesions and metastases, and spine involvement may be potential factors that affect the prognosis of GIST patients with bone metastases. A hospital-based cross-sectional study in SIGES project was conducted during 2016.5-2017.5 in West China Hospital. It was aimed to observe the prevalence of atrophic gastritis (AG) in southwest China, and assess the diagnostic strength of serum gastrin-17 (G-17) in predicting AG in Chinese population.\\xa0Asymptomatic healthy controls from health check-up, cancer-free patients with unspecific upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and histologically proven gastric cancer patients were eligible, if serum pepsinogen-I (PG-I), PG-II, and G-17 were detected. AG status was classified by the accredited cutoffs of PG-I (<70 ug/L) and PG-I/II ratio (<3). Totally, healthy controls (n\\u2009=\\u20099,425), symptomatic patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009671) and gastric cancer patients (n\\u2009=\\u2009305) were simultaneously observed, in which the prevalence of AG in southwest China were estimated as 15.9/1,000, 28.3/1,000, and 55.7/1,000 persons, respectively. The age-specific prevalence of AG in healthy controls showed a significantly uphill trend (p for trend <0.001). Higher level of serum G-17 was significantly associated with increased risk of AG in healthy population (15-30 pmol/L, aOR\\u2009=\\u200920.67, 95% CI 9.17-46.55; >30 pmol/L, aOR\\u2009=\\u2009314.41, 95% CI 166.10-595.12). Throughout the progression of stomach diseases, the diagnostic strength of serum G-17 for AG showed a downhill trend across more advanced situations. In despite of that, serum G-17 displayed a good performance in predicting AG in the entire cross-sectional population (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.94; SEN\\u2009=\\u200985.5%; SPE\\u2009=\\u200993.2%; LR+\\u2009=\\u200912.55; LR-\\u2009=\\u20090.11). Population in southwest China had intermediate prevalence of AG, while the prevalence was increased over age or disease progression. High level of serum G-17 might be a reliable non-invasive measurement to predict AG in southwest Chinese population. A 70-year-old woman received H. pylori eradication therapy in March, 201X-12. She was admitted to our department because early gastric cancer was detected on esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and we performed endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in June, 201X-2. The final diagnosis was well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Afterwards, we performed ESD two times (in November, 201X-1, and in March, 201X), and final diagnoses were both adenocarcinoma of fundic gland type. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma (AC) of the stomach (HAS) represents a rare variant of conventional gastric AC characterised by poor prognosis. They are usually managed with surgery (localised disease) and chemotherapy.\\nWe present the first case report of a patient with HAS who presented with weight loss, poor appetite, general clinical deterioration (performance status [PS] = 3), and active gastrointestinal bleeding who was treated with fractionated palliative radiotherapy (RT) using 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The use of RT was associated with excellent symptomatic and radiological response and facilitated surgery secondary to significant improvement in general fitness and PS.\\nRT may have a role in the multimodality management of hepatoid AC of the stomach. Due to limited information reported on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) patients with gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, here we used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to perform our study in a population-based scale. Extranodal GI involvement was categorized into gastric and intestinal primary sites. A total of 477 BL patients with GI involvement extracted from the SEER database between 2004 and 2015 were included in this study, 112 (23.5%) with the stomach and 365 (76.5%) with the intestine. Our study demonstrated that gastric involvement, older age, male gender, black race, advanced-stage III/IV, no-chemotherapy, and earlier years of diagnosis were associated with a significantly worse overall survival (OS) in GI BL patients after adjustment in multivariate analysis, whereas marital status did not significantly influence OS. Notably, BL Patients with gastric involvement had a significantly inferior 5-year OS in both univariate and multivariate analysis, as compared to those with intestinal involvement (37.8% vs. 70.2%; Univariate: HR\\xa0=\\xa02.637, P\\xa0<\\xa0.001; Multivariate: HR\\xa0=\\xa01.489, P\\xa0=\\xa0.016). In subgroup analysis, we demonstrated that gastric BL patients had a consistently worse OS than intestinal patients regardless of gender, clinical stage and year of diagnosis. Hopefully, with the advances in modern therapy, improved survival has been found in BL patients with GI involvement as a whole, specifically those with gastric involvement (HR\\xa0=\\xa00.529, P\\xa0=\\xa0.011) in recent years of diagnosis. In conclusion, despite the improved survival achieved in recent years, the prognosis of BL patients with gastric involvement is still poor. Novel personalized therapies and better access to intensive care remain to be needed. The lack of specific symptoms for the early detection of gastric cancer leads to the fact that it is often diagnosed at a late stage, when the prognosis is unfavorable. The analysis of molecular markers in addition to standard diagnostic procedures is a promising approach for improving the preoperative diagnosis of both gastric cancer and precancerous changes in the mucosa. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic significance of using miRNA expression to diagnosis gastric cancer and precancerous conditions (dysplasia) in histological material. In this work, 122 samples of archival histological material in the form of paraffin blocks were used: 34 samples of gastric adenocarcinoma, 54 samples of gastric ulcers with dysplasia and 34 samples of normal gastric mucosa obtained from patients after bariatric surgery. The expression level of miRNA-145-5p, -150-5p, -20a-5p, -21-5p, -31-5p, -34a-5p, -375 was determined using real-time RT-PCR. Samples were stratified into different groups using the C-RT decision tree algorithm. All miRNAs, except miRNA-20a, were included in the decision tree, which allows stratification of samples for normal mucosa, dysplasia, and gastric cancer. Normal mucosa can be distinguished from gastric cancer only by miRNA-34a, -21, -375. Diagnostic characteristics for the detection of dysplasia: specificity - 97%, sensitivity - 87%; for the detection of gastric cancer: specificity - 91%, sensitivity - 93%. The sufficiently high values of the diagnostic characteristics for detecting dysplasia of the gastric mucosa and gastric cancer obtained in our study indicate the possibility of using expression data of a small amount of miRNAs for the effective separation of samples with tumor and precancerous changes in the stomach tissue.  Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth malignancy and the third cause of cancer death worldwide, according to the global cancer statistics presented in 2018. Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification, which took effect in 2018. Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing. The cornerstone of GC treatment is surgical, in a context of multimodal therapy. Surgical treatment is being standardized, and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments. This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of mini-invasive techniques. Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view, with better short-term outcomes. The persecution of better short-term outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management, which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles. In the era of precision medicine, multimodal treatment is also evolving. The long-time-awaited results of many trials investigating the role for preoperative and postoperative management have been published, changing the clinical practice. Novel investigations focused both on traditional chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted therapies are currently ongoing. Modern platforms increase the possibility for further standardization of the different treatments, promote the use of big data, and open new possibilities for surgical learning. This systematic review in two parts assesses all the current updates in GC treatment.'"
