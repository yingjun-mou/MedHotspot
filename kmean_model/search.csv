Here, a highly trained dog was used to determine whether urine from patients with cervical premalignant lesions and malignant tumors have a cancer-specific scent. (2) Methods: A total of 195 urine samples were collected from patients with cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3), benign uterine diseases, and healthy volunteers. Each test was performed using one urine sample from a cancer patient and four samples from different controls. Each of the five urine samples was placed in a separate box. When the cancer sniffing dog stopped and sat in front of the box with a sample from a cancer patient, the test was considered as positive. (3) Results: 83 patients with cervical cancer (34 cases of cervical cancer and 49 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3), 49 patients with uterine benign diseases, and 63 healthy volunteers were enrolled, and their urine samples were collected. In 83 times out of 83 runs in a double-blind test, the trained dog could correctly identify urine samples of cervical cancer patients. (4) Conclusion: A trained dog could accurately distinguish the urine of all patients with cervical cancer or CIN3, regardless of the degree of cancer progression.",,11/12/20,"[{'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'Akihito', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-8603, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamoi', 'firstname': 'Seiryu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-8603, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kurose', 'firstname': 'Keisuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-8603, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ito', 'firstname': 'Marie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-8603, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takeshita', 'firstname': 'Toshiyuki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-8603, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kure', 'firstname': 'Shoko', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Integrative Oncological Pathology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-8602, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sakamoto', 'firstname': 'Katsuichi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynecology, Jizankai Medical Foundation Tsuboi Cancer Center Hospital, Fukushima 963-0197, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sato', 'firstname': 'Yuji', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Sniffing Dog Training Center, St. Sugar Japan, Chiba 294-0226, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Miyashita', 'firstname': 'Masao', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nippon Medical School, Tokyo 113-8602, Japan.\nTwin Peaks Laboratory of Medicine (TPLM), Twin peaks Laboratory of Medicine, Yamagata 999-4331, Japan.'}]","['cervix uteri', 'dogs', 'odorants', 'urine', 'volatile organic compounds']",Cancers,,,,766,"10,442",6.126,0.01874,2.5446205533158224,Association between Socioeconomic Status and Digestive Tract Cancers: A Case-Control Study.,"Although socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with cancer risk, little research on this association has been done in Japan. To evaluate the association between SES and digestive tract cancer risk, we conducted a case-control study for head and neck, esophageal, stomach, and colorectal cancers in 3188 cases and the same number of age- and sex-matched controls within the framework of the Hospital-based Epidemiological Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center III (HERPACC III). We employed the education level and areal deprivation index (ADI) as SES indicators. The association was evaluated with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders. Even after allowance for known cancer risk factors, the education level showed linear inverse associations with head and neck, stomach, and colorectal cancers. Compared to those educated to junior high school, those with higher education showed statistically significantly lower risks of cancer (0.43 (95% CI: 0.27-0.68) for head and neck, 0.52 (0.38-0.69) for stomach, and 0.52 (0.38-0.71) for colorectum).

However, selected polyphenol classes have not been adequately investigated in relation to GC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the intake of polyphenols in relation to GC risk. We used data from the Stomach cancer Pooling (StoP) Project, including 10 studies from six countries (3471 GC cases and 8344 controls). We carried out an individual participant data pooled analysis using a two-stage approach. The summary odds ratios (ORs) of GC for each compound, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), were computed by pooling study specific ORs obtained through multivariate logistic regression, using random effect models. Inverse associations with GC emerged for total polyphenols (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.54-0.81, for the highest versus lowest quartile of intake), total flavonoids (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.90), anthocyanidins (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56-0.92), flavanols (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.66-0.88), flavanones (OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.44-0.69), total phenolic acids (OR = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.55-0.94), and hydroxybenzoic acids (OR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.57-0.89). Results were consistent across strata of age, sex, social class, and smoking habit. Suggestive inverse associations were also found for flavonols (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.51-1.01) and hydroxycinnamic acids (OR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.58-1.06).

Specific inherited/acquired alterations or epigenetic inactivation of MMR genes are associated with microsatellite instability (MSI): the loss of crucial function in repairing DNA alterations can promote carcinogenesis by favoring the accumulation of thousands of mutations in a broad spectrum of different anatomic sites such as colon, stomach, prostate, esophagus, endometrium, lung and head and neck. Recent extensive data suggest that tumor mutational burden strongly correlates with a clinical response to immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and this response is influenced by MMR deficiency in a wide range of human solid cancers. In this context, few data about this crucial point are available for head and neck cancer (HNC). In this review, we discuss the role of MMR alterations and the resulting MSI in HNC pathogenesis. Furthermore, by summarizing the clinical available data on how they influence the progression of precancerous lesions and the risk of recurrence or second primary tumors, we want to define the current role of MSI in the management of HNC. Finally, we analyze the complex interaction between cancer cells and the immune system addressing the data now available about a potential correlation between microsatellite instability and immunotherapy response in HNC.",,10/22/20,"[{'lastname': 'Cilona', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Careggi University Hospital, Largo Brambilla, 3-50134 Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Locatello', 'firstname': 'Luca Giovanni', 'initials': 'LG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Careggi University Hospital, Largo Brambilla, 3-50134 Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Novelli', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Careggi University Hospital, Largo Brambilla, 3-50134 Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gallo', 'firstname': 'Oreste', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Careggi University Hospital, Largo Brambilla, 3-50134 Florence, Italy.'}]","['MMR proteins', 'MSI', 'head and neck cancer', 'immunotherapy', 'local recurrence', 'microsatellite instability', 'multiple primary tumors', 'progression']",Cancers,,,,766,"10,442",6.126,0.01874,1.5856592433066529,A Novel Technique to Improve Anastomotic Perfusion Prior to Esophageal Surgery: Hybrid Ischemic Preconditioning of the Stomach.

Whether exon-v6 itself is responsible for conferring these properties to CD44v6-containing isoforms remains to be elucidated. CRISPR/Cas9 and Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomers (PMOs) were used to induce specific exon-v6 skipping, maintaining the CD44 reading frame, in two GC cell lines endogenously expressing CD44v6. Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil treatment response, and self-renewal ability was compared between CRISPR/Cas9-edited, CD44v6 knockdown and mock cells. We obtained homozygous genome-edited cell lines with exon-v6 deletion. Edited cells transcribed CD44v isoforms presenting in frame v5-v7 splicing, mimicking exon-v6 skipping. Results showed that removing specifically exon-v6 sensitizes cells to cisplatin and impairs cells' self-renewal ability, similarly to CD44v6 knockdown.

GAC high mortality is due to a combination of factors, such as silent evolution, late clinical presentation, underlying genetic heterogeneity, and effective mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOCs) that make the available antitumor drugs scarcely useful. MOCs include reduced drug uptake (MOC-1a), enhanced drug efflux (MOC-1b), low proportion of active agents in tumor cells due to impaired pro-drug activation or active drug inactivation (MOC-2), changes in molecular targets sensitive to anticancer drugs (MOC-3), enhanced ability of cancer cells to repair drug-induced DNA damage (MOC-4), decreased function of pro-apoptotic factors versus up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes (MOC-5), changes in tumor cell microenvironment altering the response to anticancer agents (MOC-6), and phenotypic transformations, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the appearance of stemness characteristics (MOC-7). This review summarizes updated information regarding the molecular bases accounting for these mechanisms and their impact on the lack of clinical response to the pharmacological treatment currently used in GAC.

In this study, we investigated the potential benefit of supplementary anamorelin and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) as preventive interventions against a gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) combination chemotherapy-induced adverse effects in a mouse model. Non-cancer-bearing C3H mice were randomly allocated as follows and treated for 2 weeks-(1) non-treated control, (2) oral anamorelin alone, (3) oral 5-ALA alone, (4) gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy, (5) GC plus anamorelin, and (6) GC plus 5-ALA. GC chemotherapy significantly decreased body weight, food intake, skeletal muscle mass and induced severe gastric mucositis, which resulted in decreased ghrelin production and blood ghrelin level. The supplementation of oral anamorelin to GC chemotherapy successfully mitigated decrease of food intake during the treatment period and body weight loss at day 8. In addition, analysis of the resected muscles and stomach revealed that anamorelin suppressed chemotherapy-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by mediating the downregulation of forkhead box protein O-1 (FOXO1)/atrogin-1 signaling and gastric damage.

A signet ring cell, mimicking its moniker, contains abundant intracytoplasmic mucin that pushes the nucleus to the periphery. In these cancers, this cell feature comprises more than 50% of the tumor. Despite predilection for the gastrointestinal tract, and in particular the stomach, primary SRCCs are also described in other sites, typically in case reports. This literature, however, lacks a standardized overview of the SRCC disease entity. Using a retrospective cohort approach, we summarize the clinicodemographic and mortality outcomes of SRCCs in thirteen primary sites, comprising 95% of all SRCCs in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER), a population-level cancer database covering nearly one-third of the United States population. SRCCs general trends compared to matching nonvariant adenocarcinomas are earlier age of onset, with initial presentation favoring higher rates of regional or distant disease presentation and poor tumor differentiation.

However, definite prognostic value of SNHG12 remains unclear. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between SNHG12 expression level and cancer prognosis. A literature retrieval was conducted by searching kinds of databases. The meta-analysis was performed by using Revman 5.2 and Stata 12.0 software. Besides, The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was analyzed to validate the results in our meta-analysis via using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. The pooled results showed that high SNHG12 expression significantly indicated worse overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Tumor type, sample size, survival analysis method, and cutoff value did not alter SNHG12 prognosis value according to stratified analysis results. Additionally, higher expression of SNHG12 suggested unfavorable clinicopathological outcomes including larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced clinical stage. Online cross-validation in TCGA dataset further indicated that cancer patients with upregulated SNHG12 expression had worse overall survival and disease-free survival. Therefore, elevated SNHG12 expression was associated with poor survival and unfavorable clinical outcomes in various cancers, and therefore might be a potential prognostic biomarker in human cancers.

Tumor-alternative splicing can reveal a large class of new splicing-associated potential new antigens that may affect the immune response and can be used for immunotherapy.
The RNA-seq transcriptome data and clinical information of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) cohort were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database data portal, and data of splicing events were obtained from the SpliceSeq database. Predicting genes were validated by Asian cancer research group (ACRG) cohort and Oncomine database. RT-qPCR was used to analysis the expression of ECT2 in STAD.
A total of 32,166 AS events were identified, among which 2,042 AS events were significantly associated with patients survival. Biological pathway analysis indicated that these genes play an important role in regulating gastric cancer-related processes such as GTPase activity and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Next, we derived a risk signature, using alternate acceptor, that is an independent prognostic marker. Moreover, high ECT2 expression was associated with poorer prognosis in STAD. Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that high ECT2 expression was an independent risk factor for overall survival. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that high ECT2 expression was enriched for hallmarks of malignant tumors. The ACRG cohort and Oncomine also showed that high ECT2 expression was associated with poorer prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Finally, RT-qPCR showed ECT2 expression was higher in STAD compared to the normal tissues.

Independent factors and profiles for overall survival (OS) were determined by Cox regression analysis and decision-tree analysis, respectively. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prevalence of muscle atrophy was 82.6% and the median NLR was 3.15. In Cox regression analysis, none of factors were identified as an independent factor for survival.

As a consequence of improper control, aberrant HH signaling results in tumorigenesis and supports aggressive phenotypes of human cancers, such as neoplastic transformation, tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. Canonical activation of HH signaling occurs through binding of HH ligands to the transmembrane receptor Patched 1 (PTCH1), which derepresses the transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO). Consequently, the glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) zinc-finger transcription factors, the terminal effectors of the HH pathway, are released from suppressor of fused (SUFU)-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration, permitting nuclear translocation and activation of target genes. Aberrant activation of this pathway has been implicated in several cancer types, including medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and cancers of lung, colon, stomach, pancreas, ovarian, and breast. Therefore, several components of the HH pathway are under investigation for targeted cancer therapy, particularly GLI1 and SMO. GLI1 transcripts are reported to undergo alternative splicing to produce truncated variants: loss-of-function GLI1Î”N and gain-of-function truncated GLI1 (tGLI1).

Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is the only known precancerous precursor to OAC, but our understanding about the molecular events leading to OAC development is limited. Here, we have integrated gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles of human biopsies and identified a strong cell cycle gene expression signature in OAC compared to BO. Through analysing associated chromatin accessibility changes, we have implicated the transcription factor KLF5 in the transition from BO to OAC. Importantly, we show that KLF5 expression is unchanged during this transition, but instead, KLF5 is redistributed across chromatin to directly regulate cell cycle genes specifically in OAC cells. This new KLF5 target gene programme has potential prognostic significance as high levels correlate with poorer patient survival. Thus, the repurposing of KLF5 for novel regulatory activity in OAC provides new insights into the mechanisms behind disease progression.
Acid fluids present in the gut can sometimes â€˜go upâ€™ and damage the oesophagus, the pipe that connects the mouth and the stomach. As a result, a small number of individuals can develop Barrettâ€™s oesophagus, a condition where cells in the lining of the lower oesophagus show abnormal shapes. In certain patients, these cells then become cancerous, but exactly how this happens is unknown. This lack of understanding contributes to late diagnoses, limited treatment and low survival rates. Many cancers feature â€˜signatureâ€™ mutations in a set of genes that controls how a cell can multiply. Yet, in the case of cancers of the lower oesophagus, known genetic changes have had a limited impact on our understanding of the emergence of the disease. Here, Rogerson et al. focused instead on non-genetic changes and studied transcription factors, the proteins that bind to regulatory regions of the DNA to switch genes on and off. A close inspection of cancer cells in the lower oesophagus revealed that, in that state, a transcription factor called KLF5 controls the abnormal activation of genes involved in cell growth. This is linked to the transcription factor adopting a different pattern of binding onto regulatory regions in diseased cells. Crucially, when the cell growth genes regulated by KLF5 are activated, patients have lower survival rates. Further work is now required to examine whether this finding could help to identify patients who are most at risk from developing cancer. More broadly, the results from the work by Rogerson et al. demonstrate how transcription factors can be repurposed in a disease context.","Â© 2020, Rogerson et al.",9/4/20,"[{'lastname': 'Rogerson', 'firstname': 'Connor', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Ogden', 'firstname': 'Samuel', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Britton', 'firstname': 'Edward', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ang', 'firstname': 'Yeng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.\nGI Science Centre, Salford Royal NHS FT, University of Manchester, Salford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharrocks', 'firstname': 'Andrew D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}]","['KLF5', 'cancer biology', 'cell cycle', 'chromatin', 'human', 'oesophageal cancer', 'transcription factors']",eLife,,,,583,"46,775",7.08,0.28713,0.28129597432878302,,Persistent infections with the human pathogen ,,9/4/20,"[{'lastname': 'Jarzab', 'firstname': 'Miroslaw', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Microbiology, Department of Biosciences, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Posselt', 'firstname': 'Gernot', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Microbiology, Department of Biosciences, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Meisner-Kober', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Chemical Biology and Biological Therapeutics, Department of Biosciences, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Wessler', 'firstname': 'Silja', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Microbiology, Department of Biosciences, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.\nCancer Cluster Salzburg, Allergy-Cancer-BioNano Research Centre and, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.'}]","['CagA', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'HtrA', 'OMV', 'VacA', 'outer membrane vesicles', 'urease']",Microorganisms,,,,1738,"1,639",4.152,0.00342,1.48018751632781641,Gastric Microbiome Diversities in Gastric Cancer Patients from Europe and Asia Mimic the Human Population Structure and Are Partly Driven by Microbiome Quantitative Trait Loci.,"The human gastrointestinal tract harbors approximately 100 trillion microorganisms with different microbial compositions across geographic locations.

The results indicated that the optimum EA-Ca pectinate formula significantly improved the gastric ulcer index in comparison with raw EA. The protective effect of the optimized EA-Ca pectinate formula was further indicated by the histopathological features of the stomach. The results of the study indicate that an EA formulation in the form of Ca pectinate beads would be effective for protection against gastric ulcers because of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) administration.",,7/10/20,"[{'lastname': 'Alhakamy', 'firstname': 'Nabil A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.\nAdvanced Drug Delivery Research Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.\nCenter of Excellence for Drug Research and Pharmaceutical Industries, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Badr-Eldin', 'firstname': 'Shaimaa M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo 12613, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmed', 'firstname': 'Osama A A', 'initials': 'OAA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.\nAdvanced Drug Delivery Research Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Halwani', 'firstname': 'Abdulrahman A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Aldawsari', 'firstname': 'Hibah M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'A El-Moselhy', 'firstname': 'Mohamed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Ibn Sina National College for Medical Studies, Jeddah 22413, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia 61519, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Anter', 'firstname': 'Aliaa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia 61519, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharkawi', 'firstname': 'Sara S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia 61519, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Sultan', 'firstname': 'Muhammad H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Jazan University, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Madkhali', 'firstname': 'Osama A A', 'initials': 'OAA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Jazan University, Jazan 45142, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakhrebah', 'firstname': 'Muhammed A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Life Science and Environment Research Institute, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), Riyadh 12354, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alomary', 'firstname': 'Mohammad N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'Life Science and Environment Research Institute, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), Riyadh 12354, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Abdulaal', 'firstname': 'Wesam H', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fahmy', 'firstname': 'Usama A', 'initials': 'UA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.'}]","['NSAIDs', 'factorial design', 'formulation', 'peptic ulcer', 'pharmacokinetics', 'stomatitis']",Biomolecules,,,,1802,"3,498",4.082,0.00939,5.56528232132547629,Immunocytochemistry on scrape cellblock: An aid in the diagnosis of metastatic neoplasm with unknown primary: A series of four cases.,"Scrape cellblock (SCB) is a novel technique to suggest possible primary site in fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears from the liver, lung, and lymph nodes which are the common sites of metastasis of many primary tumors. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) on SCB averts the need of more invasive diagnostic procedures and gives a conclusive diagnosis. We present a series of four cases with unknown primary site, in which ICC was done on SCB to suggest possible primary site. Three of them were liver space-occupying lesions (SOL) and one from the periportal lymph node. In all four cases, wet-fixed smear for hematoxylin and eosin stain was prepared as routine procedure. FNAC was reported as metastatic adenocarcinoma in two and metastatic spindle cell neoplasm in one liver SOL. Periportal node was reported metastatic adenocarcinoma. Two hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from each case with higher cellularity were used to scrape off the material to prepare SCB. ICC was put which gave conclusive diagnosis in all the cases. On ICC, two cases of metastatic carcinoma in the liver were diagnosed as metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm from Gastrointestinal Tract and metastatic adenocarcinoma from the stomach. Spindle cell neoplasm of the liver was diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor from the stomach. Pancreatic head mass in metastatic periportal node was confirmed later by radiologic examination. SCB is a useful technique to make the best use of available material where reaspiration is difficult. ICC on SCB is of maximum utility to suggest possible primary sites in metastatic cases with unknown primary or where biopsy of the lesion is not possible.","Â©2020 Cytopathology Foundation Inc, Published by Scientific Scholar.",6/18/20,"[{'lastname': 'Mathur', 'firstname': 'Arpita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Bhagwan Mahaveer Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Anjali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Bhagwan Mahaveer Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Mudit', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Bhagwan Mahaveer Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Maurya', 'firstname': 'Abhishek', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Bhagwan Mahaveer Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Yadav', 'firstname': 'Anamika', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Bhagwan Mahaveer Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sethi', 'firstname': 'Neha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Bhagwan Mahaveer Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.'}]","['Immunocytochemistry', 'Scrape cellblock', 'Unknown primary']",CytoJournal,,,,10046,305,0.952,0.00042,6.049100415
